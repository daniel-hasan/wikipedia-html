<b>Roman Vishniac</b> {{IPA}} (<a href="/wiki/Russian_language" id="w">Russian</a>: Роман Вишняк; <a href="/wiki/August_19" id="w">August 19</a> <a href="/wiki/1897" id="w">1897</a> – <a href="/wiki/January_22" id="w">January 22</a> <a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a>) was a renowned <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russian</a>-<a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Photographer" id="w">photographer</a>, best known for capturing on film the culture of <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jews</a> in <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe" id="w">Central</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Europe" id="w">Eastern Europe</a> before the <a href="/wiki/Holocaust" id="w">Holocaust</a>.</p>
<p>Vishniac was an extremely diverse photographer, an accomplished <a href="/wiki/Biology" id="w">biologist</a> and a knowledgeable collector and teacher of <a href="/wiki/History_of_art" id="w">art history</a>. Throughout his life, he made significant scientific contributions to the fields of <a href="/wiki/Micrograph" id="w">photomicroscopy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Time-lapse" id="w">time-lapse photography</a>. Vishniac was very interested in history, especially that of his ancestors. In turn, he was strongly tied to his Jewish roots and was a <a href="/wiki/Zionism" id="w">Zionist</a> later in life.<sup id="_ref-roman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roman" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Roman Vishniac won international acclaim for his photography: his pictures from the <i><a href="/wiki/Shtetl" id="w">shtetlach</a></i> and Jewish ghettos, celebrity portraits, and images of microscopic biology. He is known for his book <i>A Vanished World</i>, published in 1983, which was one of the first such pictorial documentations of Jewish culture in Eastern Europe from that period and also for his extreme humanism, respect and awe for life, sentiments that can be seen in all aspects of his work.</p>
<a id="Biography" name="Biography"></a><h1>Biography</h1>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Roman  was born in his grandparent&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Dacha" id="w">dacha</a></i> outside of <a href="/wiki/Saint_Petersburg" id="w">Saint Petersburg</a>, in the town of <a href="/wiki/Pavlovsk" id="w">Pavlovsk</a>, and grew up in <a href="/wiki/Moscow" id="w">Moscow</a>.<sup id="_ref-bionote_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bionote" title="">[2]</a></sup> To live in this city was <a href="/wiki/Jews_in_Russia#Pogroms and the Pale of Settlement" id="w">a right granted to few Jews</a> but Roman could live there because his father, Solomon Vishniac, was a wealthy manufacturer of <a href="/wiki/Umbrella" id="w">umbrellas</a>, and his mother, Manya, was the daughter of affluent <a href="/wiki/Diamond" id="w">diamond</a> dealers (Roman also had a sister, Katja<sup id="_ref-berlin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-berlin" title="">[3]</a></sup>). During the summer months; however, the Vishniacs would leave: Moscow often became uncomfortably hot and the family would retreat to a <i>dacha</i> a few miles outside of that city.</p>
<p>As a child, Roman Vishniac was fascinated by <a href="/wiki/Biology" id="w">biology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Photography" id="w">photography</a>, and his room was filled with &#34;plants, insects, fish and small animals&#34;.<sup id="_ref-concern_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-concern" title="">[4]</a></sup> On his seventh birthday, Roman got a <a href="/wiki/Microscope" id="w">microscope</a> from his grandmother, to which he promptly hooked up a camera, and by which he photographed the muscles in a <a href="/wiki/Cockroach" id="w">cockroach</a>&#39;s leg at 150 times magnification. Young Vishniac used this microscope extensively, viewing and photographing everything he could find, from dead <a href="/wiki/Insect" id="w">insects</a> to animal <a href="/wiki/Scale_(zoology)" id="w">scales</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Pollen" id="w">pollen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Protozoa" id="w">protozoa</a>.<sup id="_ref-roman_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roman" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Until the age of ten, Vishniac was <a href="/wiki/Homeschooling" id="w">homeschooled</a>; from ten to seventeen, he attended a private school at which he earned a gold medal for <a href="/wiki/Scholar" id="w">scholarship</a>.<sup id="_ref-wilson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wilson" title="">[5]</a></sup> Beginning in 1914, he spent six years at <a href="/wiki/Shanyavsky_University" id="w">Shanyavsky Institute</a> (now University) in Moscow. While enrolled there, he served in the <a href="/wiki/Tsarist" id="w">Tsarist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kerensky" id="w">Kerensky</a> and <a href="/wiki/Military_history_of_the_Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet armies</a>. At the Institute, he earned a <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy" id="w">Ph.D.</a> in <a href="/wiki/Zoology" id="w">zoology</a> and became an assistant professor of biology.<sup id="_ref-concern_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-concern" title="">[4]</a></sup> As a graduate student, he worked with prestigious biologist <a href="/wiki/Nikolai_Koltzoff" id="w">Nikolai Koltzoff</a>, experimenting with inducing <a href="/wiki/Metamorphosis_(biology)" id="w">metamorphosis</a> in <a href="/wiki/Axolotl" id="w">axolotl</a>, a species of aquatic <a href="/wiki/Salamander" id="w">salamander</a>. While his experiments were a success, Dr. Vishniac was not able to publish a paper detailing his findings due to the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917" id="w">chaos in Russia</a> and his results were eventually independently duplicated. In spite of this, he went on to take a three year course in <a href="/wiki/Medicine" id="w">medicine</a>.<sup id="_ref-roman_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roman" title="">[1]</a></sup>

<a id="Berlin" name="Berlin"></a><h2>Berlin</h2>
<p>In 1918, Roman Vishniac&#39;s immediate family moved to <a href="/wiki/Berlin" id="w">Berlin</a> because of <a href="/wiki/Anti-Semitism" id="w">anti-Semitism</a> spurred by the <a href="/wiki/Third_Russian_Revolution" id="w">Third Russian Revolution</a>. Roman followed them and, shortly after arriving, married Luta (Leah) Bagg, who gave birth to two children, Mara and <a href="/wiki/Wolf_V._Vishniac" id="w">Wolf</a>.<sup id="_ref-family_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-family" title="">[6]</a></sup> Roman Vishniac supported his own budding family (and sometimes his parents as well) by working at various jobs. In his free time, he studied <a href="/wiki/Eastern_art_history" id="w">Far Eastern Art</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Berlin" id="w">University of Berlin</a>. Vishniac researched <a href="/wiki/Endocrinology" id="w">endocrinology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Optics" id="w">optics</a>, and did some photography (<i>see right</i>). In Berlin, he also initiated his <a href="/wiki/Public_speaking" id="w">public speaking</a> career by joining the <a href="/wiki/Salamander_Club" id="w">Salamander Club</a>, at which he often gave lectures on <a href="/wiki/Naturalism_(art)" id="w">naturalism</a>.<sup id="_ref-roman_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roman" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1930s, as anti-Semitism was growing in <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>, Vishniac took his famed trips to <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Europe" id="w">Eastern Europe</a>, photographing the culture of poor Jews in mountainous villages and urban ghettos. For approximately 4 years, (the exact period is debated), he would travel back and forth from Berlin to remote locations, taking thousands of pictures and living with whomever would take him in, at the same time supporting his family in Berlin. In 1939, Roman&#39;s wife and children moved to <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Sweden</a> to stay with Luta&#39;s parents, away from hostile Germany. He met up with his parents in <a href="/wiki/Nice" id="w">Nice</a> that summer.<sup id="_ref-roman_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roman" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Roman Vishniac returned to <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> in late summer 1940, and was arrested by the <a href="/wiki/P%C3%A9tain" id="w">Pétain</a> police and interned at <a href="/wiki/Camp_du_Ruchard" id="w">Camp du Ruchard</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Deportation" id="w">deportation camp</a> in <a href="/wiki/Clichy" id="w">Clichy</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>. This occurred because <a href="/wiki/Latvia" id="w">Latvia</a>, where he had had his citizenship, had been subsumed into the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> and Vishniac was considered a &#34;stateless person&#34;. After 3 months, as a result of his wife&#39;s efforts and aid from the American Joint Distribution Committee, he obtained a <a href="/wiki/Visa_(document)" id="w">visa</a> that allowed him to escape via <a href="/wiki/Lisbon" id="w">Lisbon</a> to the U.S. with his family. His father stayed behind and spent the war hidden in France; his mother died from cancer in 1941 while still in Nice.<sup id="_ref-berlin_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-berlin" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-roman_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roman" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-jewish_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jewish" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

It was during this time, in 1942, that Roman took one of his most celebrated portraits, that of <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" id="w">Albert Einstein</a>. Vishniac arrived at Einstein&#39;s home in <a href="/wiki/Princeton%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Princeton, New Jersey</a>, getting into the scientist&#39;s study with the ruse of bringing regards from mutual friends in Europe, and photographed him while the scientist was not paying attention to him, occupied in thought. Einstein later called this portrait his favourite one of him. In 1946, Roman Vishniac divorced Luta, and the next year he married Edith Ernst, an old family friend. A few years later, he gave up portraiture and went on to do freelance work in the field of <a href="/wiki/Micrograph" id="w">photomicroscopy</a>.<sup id="_ref-roman_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roman" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Vishniac, being a Jew, had to struggle immensely to take the 16,000 photos he did. Every one of his photos from this period was a candid shot; the subjects never even knew his camera existed. He also could not take more than one shot of a scene or buy two rolls of film at a time because he was not of <a href="/wiki/Aryan_race" id="w">Aryan</a> descent.<sup id="_ref-weiner_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-weiner" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-polish_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-polish" title="">[19]</a></sup> Vishniac sometimes developed his film in Berlin, other times he was forced to do it out on the countryside, in rivers of the <a href="/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains" id="w">Carpathian Mountains</a> on <a href="/wiki/Moonlight" id="w">moonless nights</a>. </p>
<p>In order to reach some of the small villages in these mountains, he had to carry heavy equipment (Leica, Rolliflex, movie camera, <a href="/wiki/Tripod" id="w">tripods</a> etc.), 115&#160;<a href="/wiki/Pound_(mass)" id="w">pounds</a> (52 <a href="/wiki/Kilogram" id="w">kilograms</a>) by his estimate, on his back, up steep roads, trekking many miles.<sup id="_ref-mitgang_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mitgang" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-children_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-children" title="">[10]</a></sup> With a concealed <a href="/wiki/Leica" id="w">Leica</a> wrapped in a scarf at his forehead or a  <a href="/wiki/Rolleiflex" id="w">Rolleiflex</a><sup id="_ref-keppler_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keppler" title="">[20]</a></sup> peeking out through an enlarged button hole of his coat,<sup id="_ref-roman_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roman" title="">[1]</a></sup> Vishniac captured tens of thousands of impoverished Jews on film, <i>&#34;[...] to preserve – in pictures, at least – a world that might soon cease to exist&#34;</i>.<sup id="_ref-mendoza_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mendoza" title="">[21]</a></sup> This Leica was acquired through a non-Jewish friend, but he had to give the <a href="/wiki/Camera" id="w">camera</a> back often (the police were trying to make sure that no Jews were using the camera, and they usually checked with his friend in the evenings).</p>
<p>For indoor shots, when the Leica was used, there was the problem of insufficient <a href="/wiki/Lighting" id="w">lighting</a>: there would rarely be artificial light in the home of a poor Jew. Vishniac could not use a tripod (for the camera had to remain concealed) to get long exposures, so he had to bring a <a href="/wiki/Kerosene" id="w">kerosene</a> <a href="/wiki/Lantern" id="w">lantern</a> (visible in some of his work), keep his back to a wall for support, and hold his breath.<sup id="_ref-weiner_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-weiner" title="">[8]</a></sup> The Rolleiflex was used mostly for outdoor scenes.</p>
<p>Roman Vishniac did not just want to preserve the memories of the Jews; he actively fought to increase awareness in the West of the worsening situation in Eastern Europe. &#34;Through his photographs, he sought to alert the rest of the world to the horrors [of the Nazi persecution]&#34;, Mitgang.<sup id="_ref-mitgang_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mitgang" title="">[14]</a></sup> In late 1938, for example, he sneaked into <a href="/wiki/Zbaszyn" id="w">Zbaszyn</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Internment_camp" id="w">internment camp</a> in <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Germany</a> near the border, where Jews awaited deportment to <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Poland</a>. After photographing the &#34;filthy barracks&#34;, as he described it, for two days,<sup id="_ref-levin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-levin" title="">[22]</a></sup> he escaped by jumping from the second floor at night and creeping away, avoiding broken glass and <a href="/wiki/Barbed_wire" id="w">barbed wire</a>. He then used photographs taken to prove the existence of such camps to the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" id="w">League of Nations</a>.<sup id="_ref-mitgang_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mitgang" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Roman&#39;s death, more photographs were discovered, and the current exhibit in <a href="/wiki/Berlin" id="w">Berlin</a> showcases such newly discovered photographs. The negatives of these were found at the end of rolls of film used by him in his scientific pursuits.</p>
<a id="Style" name="Style"></a><h4>Style</h4>
<p>Vishniac&#39;s photographs from the 1930s are all of a very distinct style; they are all focused on achieving the same end: capturing the unique culture of Jewish ghettos in Eastern Europe. His pictures all center on these people, usually in small groups, going about their daily lives: very often studying (generally religious texts), walking (many times through harsh weather), and sometimes just sitting; staring. The scenes are dramatic though: &#34;There is barely a hint of a smile on any of the faces. The eyes peer at us suspiciously from behind ancient casement windows and over a peddler&#39;s tray, from crowded schoolrooms and desolate street corners.&#34;<sup id="_ref-fenyvesi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fenyvesi" title="">[23]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Gene_Thornton" id="w">Gene Thornton</a>, writer for <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">The New York Times</a></i>, called them &#34;[...] somber with poverty and with the gray light of European Winter&#34;.<sup id="_ref-thornton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thornton" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption"><i>The Only Flowers of her Youth</i>, <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" id="w">Warsaw</a>, 1938 by Roman Vishniac, one of his most famous</div>
These pictures, all in black and white, were done with available light or sometimes a lantern,<sup id="_ref-weiner_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-weiner" title="">[8]</a></sup> yet they are still, &#34;amazingly crisp with surprising depth of field&#34;.<sup id="_ref-keppler_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keppler" title="">[20]</a></sup> Indeed, &#34;There is a grainy realism to Vishniac&#39;s photographic style. We can almost finger the coarse textures of coats and shawls; the layers of fabric worn by the people seem more related to tree bark than to the well-pressed wool suit worn by an occasional elegant passerby.&#34;<sup id="_ref-fenyvesi_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fenyvesi" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Impact" name="Impact"></a><h4>Impact</h4>
<p>Vishinac&#39;s photographs from this period are widely commended and on permanent display in many <a href="/wiki/Museum" id="w">museums</a>. <a href="/wiki/Edward_Steichen" id="w">Edward Steichen</a> places Roman Vishniac&#39;s pre-<a href="/wiki/The_Holocaust" id="w">Holocaust</a> photographs, &#34;among photography&#39;s finest documents of a time and place.&#34;&#39;<sup id="_ref-schumach_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-schumach" title="">[18]</a></sup> However, there has been criticism of Vishniac&#39;s work, focusing on the lack of diversity of his subjects in his work from Eastern Europe and quality of his composition. It has been argued that he should have also photographed wealthier Jews, in addition to the poor Jews in ghettos. Thornton criticized his photographs for their unprofessional qualities, citing &#34;errors of focus and accidents of design, as when an unexplained third leg and foot protrudes from the long coat of a hurrying scholar.&#34;<sup id="_ref-thornton_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thornton" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Vishniac&#39;s photographs have had a profound effect on Holocaust literature and have illustrated <a href="/wiki/#Publications" id="w">many books</a> about the Jewish ghettos and Holocaust. In the case of <i>The Only Flowers of her Youth</i>, the drama of the photograph inspired <a href="/wiki/Miriam_Nerlove" id="w">Miriam Nerlove</a> to write a fictional novel based on the story of the girl in the picture.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>For this work, Roman Vishniac has received the Memorial Award of the <a href="/wiki/American_Society_of_Media_Photographers" id="w">American Society of Magazine Photographers</a> in 1956. He was also the winner of the <a href="/wiki/Visual_arts" id="w">visual arts</a> category of awards of the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Book_Council" id="w">Jewish Book Council</a> in 1984; <i>The Only Flowers of her Youth</i> was deemed &#34;most impressive&#34; at the <a href="/wiki/Singapore_International_Salon_of_Photography" id="w">International Photographic Exhibition</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lucerne" id="w">Lucerne</a> in 1952; and the Grand Prize for Art in Photography, <a href="/wiki/New_York_Coliseum" id="w">New York Coliseum</a>.<sup id="_ref-roman_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roman" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-concern_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-concern" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

In addition to the candid photography for which he is best known, Vishniac worked heavily in the field of <a href="/wiki/Micrograph" id="w">photomicroscopy</a>, (specifically <a href="/wiki/Interference_microscopy" id="w">interference microscopy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cinemicroscopy" id="w">cinemicroscopy</a>). He specialized in photographing live subjects, rather than the usual dead ones and had a knack for arranging the moving specimens in &#34;just the right poses&#34;, according to <a href="/wiki/Philippe_Halsman" id="w">Philippe Halsman</a>, former president of the <a href="/wiki/American_Society_of_Magazine_Photographers" id="w">American Society of Magazine Photographers</a>. On the subject of Vishniac&#39;s skill in photomicroscopy, Halsman said he was, &#34;a special kind of genius&#34;.<sup id="_ref-roman_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roman" title="">[1]</a></sup> He worked with all sorts of specimens, from <a href="/wiki/Protozoa" id="w">protozoa</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Firefly" id="w">fireflies</a> to <a href="/wiki/Amino_acid" id="w">amino acids</a>. Vishniac&#39;s work in photomicroscopy is and was highly regarded in the field. For three consecutive years, beginning in 1952, he won the Best-of-the-Show Award of the <a href="/wiki/Biological_Photographic_Association" id="w">Biological Photographic Association</a> in New York.<sup id="_ref-roman_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roman" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of Roman Vishniac&#39;s most famous endeavors in the field of photomicroscopy was his revolutionary photographs from the inside of a firefly&#39;s eye, behind 4,600 tiny <a href="/wiki/Ommatidia" id="w">ommatidia</a>, complexly arranged. In addition, there were the images taken at the medical school of <a href="/wiki/Boston_University" id="w">Boston University</a> of the circulating <a href="/wiki/Blood" id="w">blood</a> inside a <a href="/wiki/Hamster" id="w">hamster</a>&#39;s cheek pouch. Vishniac invented new methods for light-interruption photography and color photomicroscopy.<sup id="_ref-columbia_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-columbia" title="">[13]</a></sup> His method of colorization, (developed in the 1960s and early 1970s) uses <a href="/wiki/Polarized_light" id="w">polarized light</a> to penetrate certain formations of <a href="/wiki/Cell_structure" id="w">cell structure</a> and may greatly improve the detail of an image.<sup id="_ref-roman_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roman" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Besides experimenting with the metamorphosis of <a href="/wiki/Axolotl" id="w">axolotl</a>, he also researched the <a href="/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" id="w">morphology</a> of <a href="/wiki/Chromosome" id="w">chromosomes</a> in 1920: both in Berlin. As a biologist and philosopher in 1950, he hypothesized <a href="/wiki/Polyphyletic_origin" id="w">polyphyletic origin</a>, a theory that life arose from multiple, independent <a href="/wiki/Biochemistry" id="w">biochemical</a> reactions, spawning multicellular life.

<a id="Other_photography" name="Other_photography"></a><h2>Other photography</h2>
<p>Vishniac is notable for his photographs of <a href="/wiki/Insect" id="w">insects</a> mating, <a href="/wiki/Sea_bass" id="w">sea bass</a> feasting and other living creatures in full animation. Skillfully and patiently, Vishniac would stalk insects or other such creatures for hours in the <a href="/wiki/Suburb" id="w">suburbs</a> around New York City. Before beginning the hunt, he would lie for over an hour in the grass, rubbing himself with proximate flora to make himself smell less artificial. Vishniac would then gracefully swoop close to his prey and patiently frame the scene with an <a href="/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera" id="w">SLR</a> equipped with an <a href="/wiki/Extension_tube" id="w">extension tube</a>. He had even trained himself to hold his breath for up to two minutes, so that he could take his time and not disturb slowly exposing images.<sup id="_ref-roman_p" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roman" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Roman&#39;s subjects varied throughout his life.

Roman Vishniac always had strong ties with his ancestry, especially the <a href="/wiki/Judaism" id="w">Jewish</a> aspect of it, &#34;From earliest childhood, my main interest was my ancestors&#34;.

<p>Vishniac associated much of his work with <a href="/wiki/Religion" id="w">religion</a>, though not specifically <a href="/wiki/Judaism" id="w">Judaism</a>. &#34;Nature, <a href="/wiki/God" id="w">God</a>, or whatever you want to call the creator of the <a href="/wiki/Universe" id="w">Universe</a> comes through the microscope clearly and strongly,&#34; he remarked in his laboratory one day.</p>
<p>Living with the memory of hardship, Vishniac was, &#34;an absolute <a href="/wiki/Optimism" id="w">optimist</a> filled with tragedy.
