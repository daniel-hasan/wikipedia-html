<p><b>Iron Horse State Park</b>, part of the <a href="/wiki/Washington_State_Park_System" id="w">Washington State Park System</a>, is a {{convert}} <a href="/wiki/State_park" id="w">state park</a> located in the <a href="/wiki/Cascade_Mountains" id="w">Cascade Mountains</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yakima_River" id="w">Yakima River</a> Valley, between Cedar Falls on the west and the <a href="/wiki/Columbia_River" id="w">Columbia River</a> on the east.</p>
<p>The park is a <a href="/wiki/Rail_trail" id="w">rail trail</a> that crosses <a href="/wiki/Snoqualmie_Pass" id="w">Snoqualmie Pass</a>.  The heritage park commemorating railroading was once in the <a href="/wiki/Right-of-way_(railroad)" id="w">right-of-way</a> of the The Milwaukee Road, officially the <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_Milwaukee%2C_St._Paul_and_Pacific_Railroad" id="w">Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad</a>.  The right-of-way was acquired by the state after the railroad&#39;s bankruptcy in the 1980s and has been converted into {{convert}} of <a href="/wiki/Hiking" id="w">hiking</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mountain_biking" id="w">mountain biking</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Horseback_riding" id="w">horseback riding</a> trail.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The trail west continues as the Snoqualmie Valley Trail of the King County Regional Trail System.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  The trail east along the old Milwaukee Road is also called John Wayne Pioneer Trail, though Europeans arrived by boat or by travelling north from The Oregon Trail (1840)<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>, or the railhead near south <a href="/wiki/Puget_Sound" id="w">Puget Sound</a> (1853 or c. 1872, respectively).<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Arrival to the Snoqualmie Cascades of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Northern_Railroad" id="w">Great Northern Railroad</a> in 1910 and the Chicago, Milwaukee and Puget Sound Railroad in 1911 provided one of the means for development of the logging railroads and timber industry that eventually cut nearly all the Cascade Mountains forests.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The park is part of the Mountains to Sound Greenway preserving the scenic corridor.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Like most <a href="/wiki/Rails-to-trails" id="w">rails-to-trails</a> projects, Iron Horse is popular with hikers and cyclists.  There are many trail heads across the state, most with modern facilities, ample parking for a less common trail, and even a handful of campgrounds.<sup id="_ref-WSDOT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WSDOT" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The trail passes through mostly woodland, several lakes, hidden waterfalls like the one shown below, and goes directly through the divide at the old <a href="/wiki/Snoqualmie_Tunnel" id="w">Snoqualmie Tunnel</a>.  The park is easily accessible from <a href="/wiki/I-90" id="w">I-90</a>;  unfortunately it&#39;s within sight of the freeway in some places.</p>
<p>Iron Horse seems to be more popular for its scenery than its history, although it&#39;s less well-known than other parks like the <a href="/wiki/Alpine_Lakes_Wilderness" id="w">Alpine Lakes Wilderness</a> area (which Iron Horse passes through) or <a href="/wiki/Snoqualmie_Falls" id="w">Snoqualmie Falls</a>.</p>
<p>The park trail continues through the Town of <a href="/wiki/South_Cle_Elum%2C_Washington" id="w">South Cle Elum</a> where the preserved Milwaukee Road depot and substation, as well as the remains of the rail yard are located. The <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_Milwaukee%2C_St._Paul_and_Pacific_Railroad:_South_Cle_Elum_Yard" id="w">depot, substation, and rail yard</a> are listed in the <a href="/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places" id="w">National Register of Historic Places</a>. There is a small museum in the depot. In <a href="/wiki/Kittitas%2C_Washington" id="w">Kittitas</a>, the trail passes <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_Milwaukee%2C_St._Paul_%26amp%3B_Pacific_Railroad-Kittitas_Depot" id="w">The Milwaukee Road depot</a> and the ruins of the substation. That depot is also listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In addition to these buildings, other infrastructure remains, such as tunnels and bridges.</p>
