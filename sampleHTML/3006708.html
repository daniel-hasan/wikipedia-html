<p><b><i>Hot Fuzz</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/2007_in_film" id="w">2007</a> <a href="/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> police <a href="/wiki/Action_film" id="w">action</a> <a href="/wiki/Comedy_film" id="w">comedy film</a> written by <a href="/wiki/Simon_Pegg" id="w">Simon Pegg</a> and <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Wright" id="w">Edgar Wright</a> and starring Simon Pegg and <a href="/wiki/Nick_Frost" id="w">Nick Frost</a>. They worked together previously on the <a href="/wiki/2004_in_film" id="w">2004</a> motion picture <i><a href="/wiki/Shaun_of_the_Dead" id="w">Shaun of the Dead</a></i> (the first film in the <a href="/wiki/Blood_and_Ice_Cream" id="w">Blood and Ice Cream</a> trilogy), and the television series <i><a href="/wiki/Spaced" id="w">Spaced</a></i>. It was directed by Edgar Wright and produced by <a href="/wiki/Nira_Park" id="w">Nira Park</a>. Wright revealed that he wanted to write and direct a cop film because &#34;there isn&#39;t really any tradition of cop films in the UK... We felt that every other country in the world had its own tradition of great cop action films and we had none.&#34;<sup id="_ref-NYP_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYP" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The film debuted on <a href="/wiki/February_14" id="w">February 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> in the UK and <a href="/wiki/20_April" id="w">20 April</a> in the US. <i>Hot Fuzz</i> received multiple positive reviews, earning a 90% approval rating on <a href="/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" id="w">Rotten Tomatoes</a> and 81/100 from <a href="/wiki/Metacritic" id="w">Metacritic</a>. The total international box office gross reached $78,761,971 before its DVD premiere. Shortly after the film&#39;s release, two different soundtracks were released in the UK and US.</p>
<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h2>Plot</h2>

<p>Nicholas Angel, an extremely dedicated and over-achieving <a href="/wiki/Police_officer" id="w">police officer</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Service" id="w">Metropolitan Police Service</a>, performs his duties so well that he makes everyone else look bad. As a result his superiors send him to a place where his talents won&#39;t be quite so embarrassing: the sleepy and seemingly crime-free <a href="/wiki/Village" id="w">village</a> of Sandford in rural <a href="/wiki/Gloucestershire" id="w">Gloucestershire</a>. </p>
<p>Once there, he is partnered with well-meaning but overeager and naïve police constable Danny Butterman, the son of local police inspector Frank Butterman. A committed action film fan, Danny is in awe of his new big city partner, who just might provide him with his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he longs for. Angel, meanwhile, struggles to adjust to the quiet and uneventful pace of the village, and despite clearing up several otherwise unnoticed <a href="/wiki/Crime" id="w">crimes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Misdemeanour" id="w">misdemeanours</a> in short order, soon finds his most pressing concern being a <a href="/wiki/Swan" id="w">swan</a> that has escaped from its owner.  The other major crime seen, is a shoplifting incident at the supermarket (prior to the chase of the shop lifter, while Danny is browsing through the DVDs, a copy of Shaun of the Dead, also starring Pegg and Frost, can be seen). Angel and Danny eventually bond over action films and drinks at the local pub.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Angel and Butterman chase an escaped swan</div></div>

Soon after Angel&#39;s arrival, a series of grisly murders disguised as accidents rock the village, all committed by an individual in a black hood and cloak. Increasingly convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and that the victims of the &#39;accidents&#39; were murdered, Angel begins to clash with the other officers on the force. However, Angel refuses to drop the <a href="/wiki/Investigation" id="w">investigation</a> and initially suspects Simon Skinner, the charming but sinister manager of the local <a href="/wiki/Somerfield_(UK_retailer)" id="w">Somerfield</a> supermarket, of murdering the victims due to their involvement in a lucrative property deal. His confrontation with Skinner only reveals Skinner&#39;s apparent innocence and further damages Angel&#39;s credibility with his colleagues. </p>
<p>After being ambushed in his hotel room by the cloaked murderer, who is unmasked as the trolley boy of the Somerfield supermarket acting under the instruction of Skinner, Angel is led to a nearby castle where he discovers the truth; Inspector Butterman, Skinner and the <a href="/wiki/Neighbourhood_Watch" id="w">Neighbourhood Watch</a> Alliance (NWA), intent on keeping Sandford&#39;s title of &#34;Village of the Year&#34;, have been murdering anyone who might damage the village&#39;s image. Inspector Butterman reveals that his wife committed suicide after the village lost the title many years ago, motivating him to use extreme methods to ensure Sandford wins the yearly contest. Angel discovers the bodies of various &#34;problem&#34; people whom the NWA disposed of, before being cornered and &#34;stabbed&#34; by Danny, apparently a member of the NWA. </p>
<p>Having tricked the NWA into believing that Angel is dead, Danny instead drives him to the village limits and releases him, insisting that he knew nothing about their true activities. Danny urges Angel to flee, reasoning that no one would believe the truth about Sandford. However, whilst at a <a href="/wiki/Motorway" id="w">motorway</a> service station, Angel sees the films that he and Danny bonded over on a nearby sales rack and is inspired to stop the NWA. He drives back to town and arms himself with weapons confiscated earlier in the film. After Angel meets with Danny in the village, the two begin to dispatch the members of the NWA in an increasingly destructive and frantic series of gun fights. </p>
<p>Initially confronted by their colleagues in the Sandford Police Service (who are quickly persuaded of the truth), Angel and Danny take the battle to the supermarket. Skinner and Inspector Butterman flee, and are pursued by Angel and Danny to a nearby model village. There both Skinner and Inspector Butterman are apprehended. </p>
<p>Although Angel&#39;s previous supervisors arrive from London begging Angel to return, as their crime rate has risen drastically, Angel elects to remain in Sandford. Back at the police station, the Sandford Police celebrate their triumph, but they are ambushed by the last remaining member of the NWA. He attempts to shoot Angel but Danny jumps in front of the gun and takes the bullets himself. In the resulting chaos a confiscated <a href="/wiki/Naval_mine" id="w">naval mine</a> is triggered and the station is destroyed.</p>
<p>One year later, Angel lays flowers on a grave marked &#39;Butterman&#39;; it is revealed that Danny has survived, and that the grave is his mother&#39;s. Angel has been promoted to Inspector and Danny to Sergeant, and the film ends as they go back on the beat together in Sandford.</p>

<p>While writing the script, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg intended to include Nick Frost as the partner for Pegg&#39;s character. Frost revealed that he would only do the film if he could name his character, and he chose &#34;Danny Butterman&#34;.<sup id="_ref-CinemaReview2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CinemaReview2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Cast requirements included fifty people for speaking and non-speaking parts, and there were several casting calls for citizens of <a href="/wiki/Wells" id="w">Wells</a> to fill the roles,  as the city was where the majority of the filming took place.<sup id="_ref-CinemaReview2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CinemaReview2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>British singer and actor <a href="/wiki/Joseph_McManners" id="w">Joseph McManners</a> played a cameo role as a tearaway schoolboy, however his background story and an entire sub-plot surrounding his character were cut from the final version and can only be found within the DVD bonus features.<sup id="_ref-joemcmanners-hot-fuzz-character_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-joemcmanners-hot-fuzz-character" title="">[3]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Merchant" id="w">Stephen Merchant</a> also makes two appearances as Mr Peter I Staker, who reports the escaped swan, and in a brief appearance at the end of the film, reunited with the swan when Angel is offered his job back in London.

Director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg spent eighteen months writing the script.<sup id="_ref-Gather_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gather" title="">[6]</a></sup> The first draft took eight months to develop, and after watching 138 cop-related films for dialogue and plot ideas and conducting over fifty interviews with police officers for research, the script was completed after another nine months.<sup id="_ref-Gather_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gather" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-BFB_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BFB" title="">[5]</a></sup> The title was based on the various two-word titles of action films in the <a href="/wiki/1980s_in_film" id="w">1980s</a> and <a href="/wiki/1990s_in_film" id="w">90s</a>.<sup id="_ref-About.movie_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-About.movie" title="">[7]</a></sup> In one interview Wright declared that he &#34;wanted to make a title that really had very little meaning...like <i><a href="/wiki/Lethal_Weapon" id="w">Lethal Weapon</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Point_Break" id="w">Point Break</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Executive_Decision" id="w">Executive Decision</a></i>.&#34; In the same interview, Pegg joked that when the many action films&#39; titles were chosen that &#34;...all those titles seem to be generated from two hats filled with adjectives and nouns and you just, ‘Okay, that&#39;ll do.’&#34;<sup id="_ref-About.movie_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-About.movie" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>(In the <a href="/wiki/30_August" id="w">30 August</a>, 2007 edition of film critic <a href="/wiki/Roger_Ebert" id="w">Roger Ebert</a>&#39;s &#34;Answer Man&#34; column, John Weckmueller of Milwaukee wrote that he had &#34;just listened to the commentary on the new DVD of Edgar Wright&#39;s <i>Hot Fuzz</i>. The filmmakers mention that while writing the screenplay they were reading your <i>Little Movie Glossary</i> book, which they referred to as &#39;essential reading&#39;&#34;.<sup id="_ref-rogerebert.com_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rogerebert.com" title="">[8]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>During the latter half of 2005, <a href="/wiki/Working_Title_Films" id="w">Working Title</a> approached several towns in <a href="/wiki/South_West_England" id="w">South West England</a> looking for an appropriate filming location. Simon Pegg commented &#34;We&#39;re both from the <a href="/wiki/West_Country" id="w">West Country</a> so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in <a href="/wiki/Frome" id="w">Frome</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-culture_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-culture" title="">[9]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Stow-on-the-Wold" id="w">Stow-on-the-Wold</a> was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon <a href="/wiki/Wells" id="w">Wells</a>,<sup id="_ref-CotswoldJournal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CotswoldJournal" title="">[10]</a></sup> Edgar Wright&#39;s hometown. Wright has commented &#34;and Wells is very picturesque [...] I love it but I also want to trash it&#34;.<sup id="_ref-comedy map_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-comedy map" title="">[11]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Wells_Cathedral" id="w">Wells Cathedral</a> was digitally painted out of every shot of the village, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford,<sup id="_ref-HotFuzzDVD_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HotFuzzDVD" title="">[12]</a></sup> however the <a href="/wiki/Bishop%26%2339%3Bs_Palace%2C_Wells" id="w">Bishop&#39;s Palace</a> is identifiable in some shots.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Filming also took place at the <a href="/wiki/Hendon_Police_College" id="w">Hendon Police College</a>, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track.<sup id="_ref-MLG_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MLG" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Homage" name="Homage"></a><h3>Homage</h3>
<p>Wright has said that <i>Hot Fuzz</i> takes elements from his final amateur film, <i>Dead Right</i>, which he described as both &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/Lethal_Weapon" id="w">Lethal Weapon</a></i> set in Somerset&#34; and &#34;a <i><a href="/wiki/Dirty_Harry" id="w">Dirty Harry</a></i> film in Somerset&#34;.<sup id="_ref-comedy map_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-comedy map" title="">[11]</a></sup> He uses some of the same locations in both films including the Somerfield supermarket, where he used to work as a shelf-stacker.<sup id="_ref-comedy map_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-comedy map" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Various scenes in <i>Hot Fuzz</i> feature a variety of action film DVDs and scenes from <i><a href="/wiki/Point_Break" id="w">Point Break</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Bad_Boys_II" id="w">Bad Boys II</a></i>. Director Edgar Wright revealed that he had to get permission from the actor in each video clip to use the clips and for the use of the DVD covers had to pay for the rights from the respective studios.<sup id="_ref-MWEb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MWEb" title="">[15]</a></sup> The film parodies clichés used in other action movies. On the topic of perceived gun fetishes in these movies, Pegg has said &#34;Men can&#39;t do that thing, which is the greatest achievement of humankind, which is to make another human, so we make metal versions of our own penises and fire more bits of metal out of the end into peoples heads [...] It&#39;s our turn to grab the gun by the hilt and fire it into your face&#34;.<sup id="_ref-culture_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-culture" title="">[9]</a></sup> Despite this, Pegg maintains that the film is not a spoof in that, &#34;They lack the sneer that a lot of parodies have that look down on their source material. Because we&#39;re looking up to it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-EWBrit_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EWBrit" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Effects" name="Effects"></a><h3>Effects</h3>
<p>Ten artists were used to develop the visual effects for the film.<sup id="_ref-VFX_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VFX" title="">[17]</a></sup> To illustrate the destruction of the mansion as a result of the gas explosion, gas mortars were placed in front of the building to create large-scale fireballs. The wave of fire engulfs the camera, and to achieve that effect, gas mortars were used again but were fired upwards into a black ceiling piece that sloped up towards the camera.<sup id="_ref-VFX_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VFX" title="">[17]</a></sup> When the sequence was shot at a high speed the flames appeared to surge across the ground. For one of the final scenes of the film, the Sandford police station is destroyed from an explosion. Part of the explosion was created by using a set model that showed its windows being blown out, while the building remained intact. The actual destruction of the building was depicted by exploding a miniature model of the station.<sup id="_ref-HotFuzzDVD_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HotFuzzDVD" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Similar to the work in <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>, blood and gore was prevalent throughout the film and <a href="/wiki/Visual_effects" id="w">visual effects</a> supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood: &#34;In many ways, the more extreme you make it, the more people know it is stylized and enjoy the humor inherent in how ridiculous it is. It&#39;s rather like the (eventually) limbless <a href="/wiki/Black_Knight_(Monty_Python)" id="w">Black Knight</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Monty_Python%26%2339%3Bs_Holy_Grail" id="w">Monty Python&#39;s Holy Grail</a></i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-VFX_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VFX" title="">[17]</a></sup> The most time-consuming sequence involving gore was for when the reporter&#39;s head is crushed by a section of a cathedral. A dummy was used against a <a href="/wiki/Bluescreen" id="w">green screen</a> and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body. Over seventy gunfight shots were digitally added throughout the film and Briscoe also stated: &#34;The town square shootout, for example, is full of extra little hits scattered throughout, so that it feels like our hero characters really do have it all going off, all around them...It was a great demonstration of what a difference how individual, seemingly very trivial enhancements can make a difference when combined across a sequence.&#34;<sup id="_ref-VFX_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VFX" title="">[17]</a></sup>
