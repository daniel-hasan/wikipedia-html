Thomas Holt (1811-88) owned the land that stretched from Sutherland to Cronulla. James Murphy, the manager of the Holt estate named the area after <a href="/wiki/Miranda_(Shakespeare)" id="w">Miranda</a>, a character in the <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" id="w">William Shakespeare</a> play <a href="/wiki/The_Tempest" id="w">The Tempest</a>. In an extract from a letter from James Murphy in 1921 he said: &#39;The name Miranda was given to the locality by me as manager of the Holt Sutherland Company which I formed in 1881. I thought it a soft, euphonious, musical and appropriate name for a beautiful place.&#39; It is believed that the character in the play was named after <a href="/wiki/Miranda_de_Ebro" id="w">Miranda de Ebro</a>, a town in <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Originally, land was promised to Gregory Blaxland for discovering the Blue Mountains in 1813. He sold the promise to merchant John Connell for 250 pounds in 1816. Blaxland did choose the site of his land until 1831 and when he chose this area Connell claimed it. After the dispute was settled in the courts, Connell was recognised as the owner. The land was sold in the 1860s to Thomas Holt (1811-88), who planned a sheep and cattle farm. The plan failed but the fertile ground was leased by market gardeners instead. </p>
<p>By the 1920s, <a href="/wiki/Trams_in_Sydney" id="w">steam trams</a> operated between Cronulla and Sutherland, via Miranda. The trip from Miranda to Sutherland took fifteen minutes and cost three pence. In 1923 there were five shops in Miranda, including a post office and butcher, at the intersection of the main road from Sutherland and Port Hacking Road. Settlements of returned soldiers from <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> were well established in Miranda at this time and the area was considered to be one of the best fruit-growing and poultry farming areas. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Commercial_Area" name="Commercial_Area"></a><h1>Commercial Area</h1>
<p>Miranda is most noted for its large <a href="/wiki/The_Westfield_Group" id="w">Westfield</a> shopping centre (<a href="/wiki/Shopping_mall" id="w">mall</a>), adjacent to Miranda railway station. The shopping centre runs parallel to The Kingsway, and is built on three blocks, crossing over Kiora Road and Wandella Road. This shopping centre was once notable for being the largest shopping centre in the Southern Hemisphere. Originally known as ‘Miranda Fair’, the last extension and renovation was completed in 1994, providing 107,000 square metres of retail space. <a href="/wiki/Westfield_Miranda" id="w">Westfield Miranda</a> was soon eclipsed in size by <a href="/wiki/Parramatta" id="w">Parramatta</a>&#39;s Westfield extension. Miranda Fair is currently the 8th largest in Australia. {{Fact}}</p>
<p>Miranda also has a shopping strip, running along The Kingsway and Kiora Road. Numerous commercial developments are also located on these roads and surrounding streets. A smaller shopping centre containing a supermarket and various grocery shops is located nearby in Wandella Road. </p>

<li>The Kingsway, Port Hacking Road, The Boulevarde and Kiora Road are the main roads through Miranda. Until 2002, Miranda featured a landmark that was labelled as &#34;the number one black spot in the State for minor accidents.&#34;<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> This was the five-ways roundabout which intersected The Boulevard, Kiora Road and Port Hacking Road. An AUD$8m project was completed from 25 February 2002 - 20 November 2002 to remove the roundabout and implement a series of traffic lights at the intersection. Statistics indicate that the number of collisions at the intersection fell from 222 in 2002 to 13 in 2003.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></li></ul>
