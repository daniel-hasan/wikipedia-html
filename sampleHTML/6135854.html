<p><b>Narnia</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Fantasy_world" id="w">fantasy world</a> created by <a href="/wiki/C._S._Lewis" id="w">C. S. Lewis</a> as the primary location for his series of seven <a href="/wiki/Fantasy" id="w">fantasy</a> novels for children, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia" id="w">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></i>. The world is so called after the country of Narnia, in which most of the Chronicles take place.</p>
<p>In Narnia, some animals can talk, <a href="/wiki/Mythology" id="w">mythical</a> beasts abound, and <a href="/wiki/Magic_(paranormal)" id="w">magic</a> is common. The series tracks the story of Narnia when humans, usually children, enter the Narnian world from &#39;our world&#39;, or Earth.</p>

<a id="Narnia" name="Narnia"></a><h3>Narnia</h3>
<p>The country of Narnia is where most of the action of the series is set. According to the mythology of the series, Narnia was created by the great <a href="/wiki/Lion" id="w">lion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aslan" id="w">Aslan</a>, and is filled with talking animals and mythical creatures. C. S. Lewis may have taken the name from the Italian town of <a href="/wiki/Narni" id="w">Narni</a>, whose Latin name was in fact Narnia. Narnia&#39;s geography features rolling <a href="/wiki/Hill" id="w">hills</a> rising into low <a href="/wiki/Mountain" id="w">mountains</a> to the <a href="/wiki/South" id="w">south</a>, and is predominantly <a href="/wiki/Forest" id="w">forested</a> except for <a href="/wiki/Marshland" id="w">marshlands</a> in the <a href="/wiki/North" id="w">north</a>. The region is bordered on the <a href="/wiki/East" id="w">east</a> by the Eastern <a href="/wiki/Ocean" id="w">Ocean</a>, on the <a href="/wiki/West" id="w">west</a> by a great <a href="/wiki/Mountain_range" id="w">mountain range</a>, on the north by the <a href="/wiki/List_of_places_in_The_Chronicles_of_Narnia#R" id="w">River Shribble</a>, and on the south by a <a href="/wiki/Continental_divide" id="w">continental divide</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Economy" id="w">economic</a> heart of the country is the <a href="/wiki/List_of_places_in_The_Chronicles_of_Narnia#G" id="w">Great River of Narnia</a>, which enters the country from the northwest on an east-southeasterly course to the Eastern Ocean. The seat of <a href="/wiki/Government" id="w">government</a> is <a href="/wiki/Cair_Paravel" id="w">Cair Paravel</a>, at the mouth of the Great River. Other communities along the river include, from east to west, <a href="/wiki/Beruna" id="w">Beruna</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_places_in_The_Chronicles_of_Narnia#B" id="w">Beaversdam</a>, and <a href="/wiki/List_of_places_in_The_Chronicles_of_Narnia#C" id="w">Chippingford</a>.</p>
<a id="Archenland" name="Archenland"></a><h3>Archenland</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Archenland" id="w">Archenland</a> is a mountainous country to the south of Narnia. It is bordered on the north by a continental divide and on the south by the Winding Arrow river. The seat of government is at Anvard, in the heart of the country. Anvard is both the capital city and a castle. Archenland appears to be very sparsely populated, with no other towns or villages mentioned in the Chronicles. Archenland is allied with Narnia, as is shown in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Horse_and_His_Boy" id="w">The Horse and His Boy</a></i>. Like Narnia, Archenand is inhabited primarily by talking beasts but governed by Men. For reasons unexplained in the series, the original ruling line of Archenland did not die out like those of Narnia but succeeded and remained robust through the time of High King Peter.</p>
<a id="Calormen" name="Calormen"></a><h3>Calormen</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Calormen" id="w">Calormen</a> is an <a href="/wiki/Empire" id="w">empire</a> in the south of the world of Narnia. Most of the country has a semi-arid <a href="/wiki/Climate" id="w">climate</a>, and its most notable geographic features are a <a href="/wiki/Volcano" id="w">volcano</a> known as the Flaming Mountain of Lagour, and the Great <a href="/wiki/Desert" id="w">Desert</a>. The Great Desert is in the northern part of the country, and the difficulty of crossing this desert prevented aggressive Calormene governments from invading Archenland and Narnia for centuries.</p>
<p>The cultural centre of Calormen is the River of Calormen, which flows from west to east along the south side of the Great Desert. The <a href="/wiki/Capital" id="w">capital</a> <a href="/wiki/City" id="w">city</a> is <a href="/wiki/Tashbaan#T" id="w">Tashbaan</a>, located on an <a href="/wiki/Island" id="w">island</a> in the river&#39;s <a href="/wiki/River_delta" id="w">delta</a>. River of Calormen is bordered for much of its length by <a href="/wiki/Farmland_(farming)" id="w">farmland</a> and wealthy communities. The city of Azim Balda, located at a <a href="/wiki/Crossroads_(culture)" id="w">crossroads</a> in the heart of the country, is a major hub for <a href="/wiki/Travel" id="w">travel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Communication" id="w">communications</a>.</p>
<a id="Eastern_Ocean" name="Eastern_Ocean"></a><h3>Eastern Ocean</h3>
<p>Numerous islands and <a href="/wiki/Archipelago" id="w">archipelagoes</a> dot the Eastern Ocean. Most notable among these are <a href="/wiki/Galma" id="w">Galma</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Seven_Isles" id="w">Seven Isles</a>, and <a href="/wiki/The_Lone_Islands" id="w">The Lone Islands</a>; all subjects of the Narnian crown, and <a href="/wiki/Terebinthia" id="w">Terebinthia</a>, an independent island. At the far end of the Eastern Ocean the geography becomes completely fantastic (as a result of the <b>Narnian</b> world being flat) where the sky meets the surface of the earth; in addition, it is implied that a passage to Aslan&#39;s Country is located there. The Easternmost Ocean is described as having &#34;sweet&#34; water, capable of sating both hunger and thirst, and is completely covered by large lilies. The sea becomes progressively more shallow the further East one travels, eventually terminating in a gigantic standing wave. Beyond the wave can be seen the &#34;impossibly tall&#34; mountains of <a href="/wiki/Aslan%26%2339%3Bs_Country" id="w">Aslan&#39;s Country</a>.</p>
<a id="Other_lands" name="Other_lands"></a><h3>Other lands</h3>
<p>To the north of Narnia lie Ettinsmoor and the Wild Lands of the North, both inhabited by <a href="/wiki/Giant_(mythology)" id="w">giants</a>. The most prominent settlement is the House of Harfang, a community of giants that is apparently the remnant of a much larger city which was abandoned generations ago and fell into ruin. The land west of Narnia is an uninhabited region of rugged mountains known as the Western Wild. The land of <a href="/wiki/Telmar" id="w">Telmar</a> lies somewhere beyond this region, but its exact location was never documented, and beyond it are the western islands. Underland is located in great <a href="/wiki/Cavern" id="w">caverns</a> deep beneath the ground of Narnia. The land of <a href="/wiki/Bism" id="w">Bism</a> lies far below Underland.</p>
<a id="Inspiration" name="Inspiration"></a><h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>The landscape of Lewis&#39; native <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland" id="w">Northern Ireland</a> played a large part in the creation of the Narnian landscape. In his essay <i>On Stories</i>, Lewis wrote &#34;I have seen landscapes, notably in the <a href="/wiki/Mourne_Mountains" id="w">Mourne Mountains</a> and southwards which under a particular light made me feel that at any moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge&#34;. In a letter to his brother, Lewis would later confide &#34;that part of <a href="/wiki/Rostrevor" id="w">Rostrevor</a> which overlooks <a href="/wiki/Carlingford_Lough" id="w">Carlingford Lough</a> is my idea of Narnia&#34;. Although in adult life Lewis lived in <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, he returned to Northern Ireland often and retained fond memories of the Irish scenery, saying &#34;I yearn to see <a href="/wiki/County_Down" id="w">County Down</a> in the snow; one almost expects to see a march of dwarfs dashing past. How I long to break into a world where such things were true.&#34;</p>

<a id="Humans_from_our_world" name="Humans_from_our_world"></a><h3>Humans from our world</h3>
<p>A total of eleven named humans from our world have entered Narnia, four boys, two men, four girls, and a woman.</p>
<p>The four Pevensie children are the best known: <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pevensie" id="w">Peter Pevensie</a> – The High King Peter the Magnificent; <a href="/wiki/Susan_Pevensie" id="w">Susan Pevensie</a> – Queen Susan the Gentle; <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Pevensie" id="w">Edmund Pevensie</a> – King Edmund the Just; and <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Pevensie" id="w">Lucy Pevensie</a> – Queen Lucy the Valiant. All of them appear in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lion%2C_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe" id="w">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a></i> and in <i><a href="/wiki/Prince_Caspian" id="w">Prince Caspian</a></i>. Edmund and Lucy appear in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Voyage_of_the_Dawn_Treader" id="w">The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</a></i> and all of them appear (but Peter, who is out fighting giants on the northern frontier) as adults in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Horse_and_his_Boy" id="w">The Horse and his Boy</a></i>.</p>
<p>Others from our world include <a href="/wiki/King_Frank" id="w">King Frank</a> (who had been a cabman in London) and his wife <a href="/wiki/Queen_Helen" id="w">Queen Helen</a>, who were the first king and queen of Narnia and whose descendants lived in Narnia for many generations. They, together with Uncle Andrew Ketterley, <a href="/wiki/Digory_Kirke" id="w">Digory Kirke</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Polly_Plummer" id="w">Polly Plummer</a> appear in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Magician%26%2339%3Bs_Nephew" id="w">The Magician&#39;s Nephew</a></i>. <a href="/wiki/Eustace_Scrubb" id="w">Eustace Scrubb</a>, a cousin of the Pevensies, appears in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Voyage_of_the_Dawn_Treader" id="w">The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Silver_Chair" id="w">The Silver Chair</a></i>, and <a href="/wiki/Jill_Pole" id="w">Jill Pole</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Schoolmate" id="w">schoolmate</a> of Scrubb&#39;s, also appears in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Silver_Chair" id="w">The Silver Chair</a></i>. All of these except for <a href="/wiki/Susan_Pevensie" id="w">Susan Pevensie</a> and <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Andrew" id="w">Uncle Andrew</a> appear in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Last_Battle" id="w">The Last Battle</a></i>.</p>
<p>There were also about a dozen unnamed humans from our world (six pirates and their women) who repopulated the unpeopled land of Telmar and founded the race of the Telmarines. As Aslan says in <i><a href="/wiki/Prince_Caspian" id="w">Prince Caspian</a></i>, they accidentally found in a cave &#34;one of the chinks or chasms between that world and this&#34; (i.e. between our world and Narnia), and he adds, &#34;There were many chinks or chasms between worlds in old times, but they have grown rarer. This was one of the last: I do not say <i>the</i> last.&#34; So quite possibly others came to Narnia from our world as well, but Lewis did not record their histories for us.</p>
<p>Although he is not a human, Strawberry, the cabman&#39;s horse also entered Narnia from our world and there was chosen to be a talking beast and transformed into the <a href="/wiki/Winged_horse" id="w">winged horse</a> Fledge.</p>
<a id="Dwarfs" name="Dwarfs"></a><h3>Dwarfs</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Dwarfs" id="w">Dwarfs</a> are a race native to Narnia. They are called Sons of Earth by <a href="/wiki/Aslan" id="w">Aslan</a>, as opposed to humans, who are called Sons of Adam or Daughters of Eve. Dwarfs exist in at least two varieties: <a href="/wiki/Black_Dwarfs_(Narnia)" id="w">Black Dwarfs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Red_Dwarfs_(Narnia)" id="w">Red Dwarfs</a>; the only significant physical difference between the two is the colour of their hair. While many <a href="/wiki/Red_Dwarfs" id="w">Red Dwarfs</a> are kind and loyal to Aslan, Black Dwarfs appear to be more selfish and hostile. All documented dwarfs are male and live together in <a href="/wiki/Communities" id="w">communities</a>, although they are known to mingle with and reproduce with humans. Consequently, it is possible for there to be females of dwarfish descent despite the lack of (or non-appearance in the books of) female dwarfs. For example, Prince Caspian&#39;s Tutor Cornelius is a half-dwarf, and Caspian&#39;s former nurse is described as &#34;a little old woman who looked as if she had dwarf blood in her&#34;.</p>
<p>Dwarfs, like <a href="/wiki/Faun" id="w">fauns</a>, <a href="/wiki/Satyr" id="w">satyrs</a>, the <a href="/wiki/River_god" id="w">river god</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Naiad" id="w">Naiad</a> daughters and the tree people (<a href="/wiki/Deity" id="w">deities</a> of the woods) stepped forth when Aslan (in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Magician%26%2339%3Bs_Nephew" id="w">The Magician&#39;s Nephew</a></i>) called for Narnia to &#34;Awake. Love. Think. Speak. Be walking trees. Be talking beasts. Be divine waters.&#34; As the name &#34;sons of Earth&#34; implies, the dwarfs were presumably born of the earth as the <a href="/wiki/Dryad" id="w">Dryads</a> were of the trees and the Naiads of the waters. When Aslan called the first council when the land was &#34;not yet five hours old&#34;, he called the chief Dwarf to present himself. Dwarfs appear as the King&#39;s train-bearers at the coronation of King Frank. (Naiads — river nymphs — held Queen Helen&#39;s robes; ibid. ch. 14.) In keeping with their character as sons of Earth, the dwarfs are skilled and prolific <a href="/wiki/Smith_(metalwork)" id="w">smiths</a>, <a href="/wiki/Miner" id="w">miners</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Carpenter" id="w">carpenters</a>. In battle they are renowned as deadly <a href="/wiki/Archer" id="w">archers</a>. According to <i><a href="/wiki/Prince_Caspian" id="w">Prince Caspian</a></i>, chapter 8, a Dwarf can walk all day and night.</p>
<a id="Talking_animals" name="Talking_animals"></a><h3>Talking animals</h3>
<p>Many of the animals found in our world can also be found in Narnia. In addition, there are talking versions of most of these animals. When <a href="/wiki/Aslan" id="w">Aslan</a> breathed upon the first animal <a href="/wiki/Pairs" id="w">pairs</a>, some not only gained thought and speech, but changed in size as well. Smaller animals (<a href="/wiki/Rodents" id="w">rodents</a>, <a href="/wiki/Birds" id="w">birds</a> and small <a href="/wiki/Mammals" id="w">mammals</a>) are larger than their non-talking <a href="/wiki/Relatives" id="w">relatives</a> and larger animals are slightly smaller. <a href="/wiki/Talking_Beasts" id="w">Talking Beasts</a> can be divided into four main categories: <a href="/wiki/Avian" id="w">Avian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ungulate" id="w">Hoofed</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mammal" id="w">Mammal</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Reptile" id="w">Reptile</a>. There are no talking <a href="/wiki/Fish" id="w">fish</a> or <a href="/wiki/Insects" id="w">insects</a>, though there are aquatic <a href="/wiki/Beasts" id="w">Beasts</a>.</p>
<a id="Witches" name="Witches"></a><h3>Witches</h3>
<p>There are two <a href="/wiki/Witchcraft" id="w">witches</a> mentioned in the Narnian books, the &#34;<a href="/wiki/White_Witch" id="w">White Witch</a>&#34; (a.k.a. Jadis, <a href="/wiki/Emperor" id="w">empress</a> of <a href="/wiki/Charn" id="w">Charn</a>, also called the &#34;White Lady&#34; by a <a href="/wiki/Hag" id="w">hag</a> who visits <a href="/wiki/Caspian_X" id="w">Caspian X</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Prince_Caspian" id="w">Prince Caspian</a></i>) and the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Lady_of_the_Green_Kirtle" id="w">Lady of the Green Kirtle</a>&#34; (a.k.a. the Green Lady).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/White_Witch" id="w">Jadis</a> (French, &#39;formerly&#39;, &#39;in the past&#39;; also Turkish, &#39;witch&#39;, spelled <b>cadı</b>) is the last <a href="/wiki/Kinship_and_Descent" id="w">scion</a> of the royal house of Charn; she is also said (in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lion%2C_the_Witch%2C_and_the_Wardrobe" id="w">The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a></i>) to be descended from Adam&#39;s first wife, <a href="/wiki/Lilith" id="w">Lilith</a>, and to have both <a href="/wiki/Genie" id="w">Jinn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Giant_(mythology)" id="w">Giant</a> <a href="/wiki/Blood" id="w">blood</a> in her veins. According to the <a href="/wiki/List_of_characters_in_The_Chronicles_of_Narnia#B" id="w">Beavers</a>, she has no human blood at all, although she has the appearance of a very tall human woman. When Jadis first entered Narnia on its <a href="/wiki/#Creation of Narnia" id="w">creation</a> she was banished to the north by <a href="/wiki/Aslan" id="w">Aslan</a> where she spent nine hundred years in <a href="/wiki/Exile" id="w">exile</a>. By the time she had taken over Narnia she had an army of followers that she had obtained during her time in the north.</p>
<p>The Green Lady is able to transform herself into a <a href="/wiki/Snake" id="w">snake</a> (variously referred to as a <a href="/wiki/Worm" id="w">worm</a> — also written &#34;orm&#34; — in keeping with archaic or poetic English usage), and does so twice in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Silver_Chair" id="w">The Silver Chair</a></i>, once when she kills <a href="/wiki/Rilian" id="w">Rilian</a>&#39;s mother, and once when she tries to kill Rilian himself and his companions. Most of her other powers seem to be related to <a href="/wiki/Seduction" id="w">seduction</a> and <a href="/wiki/Enslavement" id="w">enslavement</a>; she has bewitched and enslaved Rilian and an army of underground <a href="/wiki/List_of_Narnian_creatures#G" id="w">gnomes</a>, and almost succeeds in bewitching <a href="/wiki/Jill_Pole" id="w">Jill</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eustace_Scrubb" id="w">Eustace</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Puddleglum" id="w">Puddleglum</a>. </p>
<p>There are also much less attractive forms of witches: <a href="/wiki/Hags" id="w">hags</a>, such as the ones that appear in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lion%2C_the_Witch%2C_and_the_Wardrobe" id="w">The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a></i> in Jadis&#39; army, and the one <a href="/wiki/Nikabrik" id="w">Nikabrik</a> brought to council in <a href="/wiki/Aslan%26%2339%3Bs_How" id="w">Aslan&#39;s How</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Prince_Caspian" id="w">Prince Caspian</a></i>, and other evil beings which might be classified as witches by certain definitions. They are clearly much less powerful than the other witches.</p>
<a id="Mythological_creatures" name="Mythological_creatures"></a><h3>Mythological creatures</h3>
<p>Other inhabitants of the Narnian world based on known mythological or folkloric creatures include <a href="/wiki/Boggle_(Narnia)" id="w">Boggles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Centaurs" id="w">Centaurs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cruels" id="w">Cruels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dragons" id="w">Dragons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dryads" id="w">Dryads</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gnome" id="w">Earthmen</a> or <a href="/wiki/Gnomes" id="w">gnomes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Efreet" id="w">Efreets</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ettins" id="w">Ettins</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fauns" id="w">Fauns</a>, <a href="/wiki/Giant_(mythology)" id="w">Giants</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ghouls" id="w">Ghouls</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hags" id="w">Hags</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hamadryads" id="w">Hamadryads</a>, <a href="/wiki/Horrors" id="w">Horrors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Incubus_(demon)" id="w">Incubi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maenads" id="w">Maenads</a>, <a href="/wiki/Minotaurs" id="w">Minotaurs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Monopods" id="w">Monopods</a>, <a href="/wiki/Naiads" id="w">Naiads</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ogres" id="w">Ogres</a>, <a href="/wiki/Orknies" id="w">Orknies</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pegasus" id="w">Winged Horses</a>, <a href="/wiki/People_of_the_Toadstools" id="w">People of the Toadstools</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology)" id="w">Phoenix</a>, <a href="/wiki/Satyrs" id="w">Satyrs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sea_People" id="w">Sea People</a> (<a href="/wiki/Mermen" id="w">mermen</a>), <a href="/wiki/Sea_serpent" id="w">Sea Serpents</a>, <a href="/wiki/Silvans" id="w">Silvans</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spectres" id="w">Spectres</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sprite_(creature)" id="w">Sprites</a>, <a href="/wiki/Star_People" id="w">Star People</a>, <a href="/wiki/Unicorns" id="w">Unicorns</a>, <a href="/wiki/Werewolves" id="w">Werewolves</a>, <a href="/wiki/Woose" id="w">Wooses</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Wraiths" id="w">Wraiths</a>.  These are a free mix of creatures from Greco-Roman sources and others from native British tradition.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The author says in one scene in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lion%2C_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe" id="w">the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a></i> that the evil creatures cannot be described, since the book must be suitable for children.</p>
<a id="Other_creatures_and_inhabitants" name="Other_creatures_and_inhabitants"></a><h3>Other creatures and inhabitants</h3>
<p>Narnia is inhabited by <a href="/wiki/Marsh-wiggle" id="w">Marsh-wiggles</a> (creatures of Lewis&#39; own invention), and <a href="/wiki/Dufflepuds" id="w">Dufflepuds</a> (adapted from <a href="/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder" id="w">Pliny</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Monopods" id="w">Monopods</a>) live on a distant island. And there are singular personages who frequent or inhabit Narnia and its surrounding countries including: the <a href="/wiki/Asopus" id="w">River god</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dionysus" id="w">Bacchus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Father_Christmas" id="w">Father Christmas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Father_Time" id="w">Father Time</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pomona" id="w">Pomona</a>, <a href="/wiki/Silenus" id="w">Silenus</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tash_(fiction)" id="w">Tash</a>. It should also be noted that the Stars themselves are sentient beings within Narnia. <a href="/wiki/Coriakin" id="w">Coriakin</a>, the Wizard, who rules over the <a href="/wiki/Dufflepuds" id="w">Dufflepuds</a>/<a href="/wiki/Monopods" id="w">Monopods</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ramandu" id="w">Ramandu</a>, whose daughter marries <a href="/wiki/Caspian_X" id="w">Caspian X</a>, are both stars who, for various reasons, are earth-bound. Both of these individuals were encountered in <a href="/wiki/The_Voyage_of_the_Dawn_Treader" id="w">&#39;&#39;The Voyage of the &#39;&#39;Dawn Treader</a>.</p>
<a id="Cosmology" name="Cosmology"></a><h2>Cosmology</h2>
<a id="General_characteristics" name="General_characteristics"></a><h3>General characteristics</h3>
<p>The world of Narnia is a <a href="/wiki/Flat_Earth" id="w">flat world</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Geocentric" id="w">geocentric</a> universe. Its sky is a dome that mortal creatures cannot penetrate.</p>
<p>Narnia&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Star" id="w">stars</a> are burning <a href="/wiki/Humanoid" id="w">humanoid</a> beings. Its <a href="/wiki/Constellation" id="w">constellations</a> are the result of a mystical dance upon the sky, performed by the stars to announce the works and comings of <a href="/wiki/Aslan" id="w">Aslan</a>, Narnia&#39;s creator. The stars also arrange themselves to allow seers to foretell certain future events.</p>
<p>The Narnian sun is a flaming disc that revolves around the world once daily. The sun has its own <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" id="w">ecosystem</a>, and is thought to be inhabited by great white birds, which appear in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Voyage_of_the_Dawn_Treader" id="w">The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</a></i>. Some of the <a href="/wiki/Vegetation" id="w">vegetation</a> on the sun is known to contain healing properties. For example, the extract of a certain fire-flower found in the mountains can heal any wound or <a href="/wiki/Disease" id="w">sickness</a>, and a fire-berry that grows in its valleys, when eaten by a fallen star named Ramandu, works to reverse the effects of age.</p>
<p>Suggested by several of the books, the ground of Narnia may be a living organism. In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Silver_Chair" id="w">The Silver Chair</a></i>, the main characters find a land named <a href="/wiki/Bism" id="w">Bism</a> many miles below Narnia, in which diamonds and other jewels provide juice when crushed or squeezed. They find the idea unbelievable until a <a href="/wiki/Gnome" id="w">gnome</a> explains that the precious stones found in Bism are real, not dead like the ones found in the &#34;shallow&#34; mines made by dwarfs and others who live on the surface.

<p>The Narnian world is part of a <a href="/wiki/Parallel_universe_(fiction)" id="w">multiverse</a> of countless worlds including Earth and the world of <a href="/wiki/Charn" id="w">Charn</a>. These are connected by a meta-world or <a href="/wiki/Linking_room" id="w">linking room</a> known as the <a href="/wiki/Wood_between_the_Worlds" id="w">Wood between the Worlds</a>. Not much is known about this wood, but it appears to be an empty space occurring as a side effect of the multiverse&#39;s underlying structure. This space takes the form of a dense forest with <a href="/wiki/Pond" id="w">pools</a> of water. With appropriate magic (or a device such as rings made from the soil), each pool leads to a different world.
The Wood Between the Worlds seems to have an effect on the magic/strength of evil people — the <a href="/wiki/White_Witch" id="w">White Witch</a> becomes weak and ill when taken there.</p>
<a id="Time" name="Time"></a><h3>Time</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> visitors to Narnia observe that the passage of time while they are away is unpredictable (although someone who enters Narnia will always arrive earlier than someone who enters later). The tendency is for time to pass faster in Narnia than at home, but this is not universally true. As Aslan is able to summon gateways between Earth and Narnia, it is quite probable that all portals exist at his pleasure and he is able to control where they lead, both in space and time. This would mean that time, from the perspective of those travelling between the worlds, would pass in each world entirely independent of the other.</p>
<p>There is some confusion concerning the intersections of the timelines between this world and Narnia. The <a href="/wiki/Telmarine" id="w">Telmarines</a> were descended from <a href="/wiki/Pirate" id="w">pirates</a> from our world, who had stumbled through a door between the worlds they discovered on an island in the South Seas. Some believe this references the men involved in the famous <a href="/wiki/Mutiny_on_the_Bounty" id="w">Mutiny on the Bounty</a> in the late 18th century who eventually settled on <a href="/wiki/Pitcairn_Island" id="w">Pitcairn Island</a> in the southern <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a>. If true, this would put their arrival before the first visit to Narnia, in the late 19th century of our world. On that occasion, the visitors witnessed the creation of Narnia, which would mean that the pirates, leaving much earlier, would arrive much later.</p>
<p>However, the books do not say that the pirates were pre-<a href="/wiki/Industrialisation" id="w">industrial</a>. They could easily be from a later post-industrial era and so no confusion may be necessary, even without assuming the theory of independent time mentioned above.</p>
<p>At the time <i>Prince Caspian</i> was written, however, Lewis may not have supposed that Narnia was created so recently; if so, he would not have had any time constraints upon his &#34;pirates&#34;. The wording of the story of the Telmarines is vague enough, however, that it could be placed in many different time periods.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>

<a id="Creation_of_Narnia" name="Creation_of_Narnia"></a><h3>Creation of Narnia</h3>
<p>The Creation of Narnia was witnessed by six creatures: <a href="/wiki/White_Witch" id="w">Jadis</a>, Empress of Charn; <a href="/wiki/Digory_Kirke" id="w">Digory Kirke</a>; <a href="/wiki/Polly_Plummer" id="w">Polly Plummer</a>; <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Ketterley" id="w">Andrew Ketterley</a>; <a href="/wiki/King_Frank" id="w">Frank</a>, a cabby; and Strawberry, his cabhorse. During a failed attempt by Digory to transfer Jadis from <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> in our world back to her own world of Charn, the group arrived in the Unmade darkness of Narnia just prior to Aslan calling it into being.</p>
<p>Aslan began the creation soon after they arrived, and with his song called forth the stars, sun, and eventually all landforms, plants, and animals as well. When he was finished, Aslan selected certain animals from these to be Talking Animals, giving to them, and all other magical creatures, Narnia as their new home, to own and rule it with wisdom and caring.</p>
<p>Aslan next appointed its first rulers, the cab driver and his wife (the latter having been called to Narnia by Aslan), as King Frank I and his wife Queen Helen, and commanded them to rule peacefully over the talking beasts. Aware that the evil Witch-Queen Jadis had entered his new land, Aslan sent Digory to retrieve a magic apple from a garden located in the Western Wild beyond Narnia. When he returned, the apple was planted by the river where it immediately grew into a tree which, as Aslan explained, would protect Narnia from Jadis for many years.</p>
<p>Aslan allowed Digory to take one of the apples from the new tree back with him to our world for his ill mother. After she had eaten it, Digory planted the core in his garden where it grew into a great apple tree. Many years later the tree was blown down in a storm and the now <a href="/wiki/Professor_Kirke" id="w">Professor Kirke</a> had its wood made into the <a href="/wiki/Wardrobe" id="w">wardrobe</a> which figures in the title of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lion%2C_the_Witch%2C_and_the_Wardrobe" id="w">The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a></i>, and became the entrance by which future children discovered Narnia.</p>
<p>A possible oversight in the overall plotline that has been noted by readers is that by the time of &#34;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&#34;, there are no humans to be seen in Narnia, but it is known that King Frank and Queen Helen had children. Some of them settled in Archenland, and presumably King Lune and his courtiers in Archenland (contemporary with the Pevensies&#39; Narnian reign, as recorded in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Horse_and_His_Boy" id="w">The Horse and His Boy</a></i>) were of that stock. Possible explanations range from a simple oversight (or lack of foresight) by Lewis, to humanity being insignificant or in exile (perhaps in Archenland), to an implied genocide by Jadis when she becomes the White Witch. Also, the children of King Frank and Queen Helen married nymphs and other Narnian beings, so one might possibly suppose that their human offspring were assimilated into other Narnian species. Whatever answer one chooses, it must be noted that the four children are unique enough when they appear in Narnia that they attract attention to themselves. A book titled <i>Is Man a Myth?</i> is observed in a Narnian home, implying some Narnians had come to question whether humans had ever existed at all.</p>
<a id="Rule_of_the_White_Witch" name="Rule_of_the_White_Witch"></a><h3>Rule of the White Witch</h3>
<p>The land of Narnia was in peace for hundreds of years after its creation. This peace lasted until, eventually, Jadis the Witch-Queen returned. Known then as the White Witch, she reigned as a tyrant, turning anyone who disobeyed her into stone with her wand. She did, however, favour the black dwarfs (&#34;black&#34; referring to hair color) and evil beasts of Narnia. Using magic, she covered the land in ice and snow for one hundred years, making it &#34;always winter and never Christmas.&#34; Although Jadis claimed to be Queen of Narnia and Chatelaine of Cair Paravel, she had her own fortress in the north where her halls were full of the statues of Narnians she had turned to stone. But she watched out for a prophecy that might come true: &#34;when Adam&#39;s flesh and Adam&#39;s bone sit at Cair Paravel in throne, the evil time will be over and done.&#34; To make sure no humans came into Narnia she set up spies to watch out for humans. Thankfully for the good Narnians, one of her spies, the faun Tumnus, befriended Lucy when she came into Narnia, and she and her siblings managed to reach Aslan before she could kill them. Jadis&#39; reign officially ended when Aslan returned to Narnia and the ice and snow melted, but the Witch shamelessly and stubbornly still insisted she was Queen. That only lasted a matter of days before she was killed by Aslan at the Battle of Beruna.</p>
<a id="Golden_Age" name="Golden_Age"></a><h3>Golden Age</h3>
<p>Four children named <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pevensie" id="w">Peter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Susan_Pevensie" id="w">Susan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Pevensie" id="w">Edmund</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Pevensie" id="w">Lucy Pevensie</a>, playing in <a href="/wiki/Digory_Kirke" id="w">Professor Kirke</a>&#39;s house stumbled upon the secret of the wardrobe, and discovered it led to a snowy waste full of trees. They arrived at a time when rumours were beginning to spread that the great <a href="/wiki/Lion" id="w">Lion</a> <a href="/wiki/Aslan" id="w">Aslan</a> had returned, and the hundred years of winter were on the verge of ending. Becoming part of his court, they fought in the first great <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Beruna_Ford" id="w">Battle of Beruna Ford</a> and defeated the <a href="/wiki/White_Witch" id="w">White Witch</a>. <a href="/wiki/Aslan" id="w">Aslan</a> then fulfilled an ancient Narnian <a href="/wiki/Prophecy" id="w">prophecy</a> and made the children <a href="/wiki/Monarch" id="w">Kings</a> and <a href="/wiki/Queen_regnant" id="w">Queens</a> of Narnia. Because of the great prosperity Narnia experienced under their reign, this period of Narnian history is known as its <a href="/wiki/Golden_Age" id="w">Golden Age</a>. While the evil <a href="/wiki/Queen_Jadis" id="w">Queen Jadis</a> ruled Narnia, other countries were too afraid of her power to attack. However, after her reign had ended the new Kings and Queens had these other countries to contend with. During their time as rulers they had to drive back the northern giants and defeat the army of <a href="/wiki/Calormen" id="w">Calormen</a>, a harsh desert land south of Narnia ruled by the <a href="/wiki/Tisroc" id="w">Tisroc</a> who wished to conquer Narnia. However, the two Kings and two Queens were always triumphant and when they ruled, Narnia was a safe and happy land.</p>
<a id="Invasion_of_the_Telmarines" name="Invasion_of_the_Telmarines"></a><h3>Invasion of the Telmarines</h3>
<p>Some hundred years after the return of the four Pevensie children to our world, Narnia was invaded by a people to the West called the <a href="/wiki/Telmar" id="w">Telmarines</a>. Of the time between the children&#39;s return and the invasion, little is known. The Telmarines, descendants of pirates from our world, had experienced a great famine, and, crossing through a pass in the mountains to the south near Calormen, they reached Narnia. After years of Telmarine rule, many native Narnians died out or decreased in number, many going into hiding, and humans became the dominant species. By the time of the birth of Caspian the Tenth, the old days of Narnia were often regarded as legend.</p>
<a id="King_Caspian_X's_Rule" name="King_Caspian_X's_Rule"></a><h3>King Caspian X&#39;s Rule</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pevensie" id="w">High King</a> and his siblings returned to Narnia, 1288 Narnian years after their departure. The current king there, named <a href="/wiki/Miraz" id="w">Miraz</a>, was an evil man who had murdered his brother and usurped the throne, and who also planned to murder the true heir, his nephew <a href="/wiki/Caspian_X" id="w">Caspian X</a>. Despite the subject being forbidden, <a href="/wiki/Caspian" id="w">Caspian</a> had been illicitly taught about the magical history and creatures of Narnia prior to the arrival of the <a href="/wiki/Telmarines" id="w">Telmarines</a> by his old nurse maid and his tutor, a half-<a href="/wiki/Dwarf" id="w">dwarf</a> named Cornelius, and had become sympathetic to their plight. The four children helped <a href="/wiki/Caspian" id="w">Caspian</a> defeat <a href="/wiki/Miraz" id="w">Miraz</a> at the second Battle of <a href="/wiki/Beruna" id="w">Beruna</a>, set him on the throne, and under his rule humans and talking beasts lived in Narnia together happily for years. It was in a way a repeat of the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Age" id="w">Golden Age</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Lucy_Pevensie" id="w">Lucy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Pevensie" id="w">Edmund</a> reached Narnia once more three years later with their spoiled cousin <a href="/wiki/Eustace_Scrubb" id="w">Eustace</a>, and sailed with <a href="/wiki/Caspian_X" id="w">Caspian X</a> (now King of Narnia and older) on a legendary voyage aboard the ship <i><a href="/wiki/Dawn_Treader" id="w">Dawn Treader</a></i>. <a href="/wiki/Caspian_X" id="w">Caspian</a> had undertaken this journey in order to keep a promise he made, to find the <a href="/wiki/The_Seven_Great_Lords_of_Narnia" id="w">seven lords</a> of Narnia who had been banished by his uncle <a href="/wiki/Miraz" id="w">Miraz</a> to the far Eastern Seas beyond the Lone Islands and had never returned. On this voyage <a href="/wiki/Caspian_X" id="w">Caspian</a> reinstated Narnian control over the Lone Islands (which had lapsed under Telmarine rule) and explored the unknown eastern islands to the very edge of the world. The explorers had many adventures amongst these islands which included fighting a <a href="/wiki/Sea_serpent" id="w">sea serpent</a>, encountering a <a href="/wiki/Magician_(fantasy)" id="w">wizard</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Invisible" id="w">invisible</a> subjects, and (in the case of <a href="/wiki/Eustace_Scrubb" id="w">Eustace</a>) being turned into a <a href="/wiki/Dragon" id="w">dragon</a> for a time before being returned to human form by <a href="/wiki/Aslan" id="w">Aslan</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Caspian_X" id="w">Caspian</a> married a <a href="/wiki/Beautiful" id="w">beautiful</a> woman (the daughter of a <a href="/wiki/Star" id="w">star</a> named <a href="/wiki/Ramandu" id="w">Ramandu</a>) he met on that voyage, and she became a great <a href="/wiki/Queen_consort" id="w">Queen</a> of Narnia. They had a son named <a href="/wiki/Rilian" id="w">Rilian</a>, but the Queen was killed by a <a href="/wiki/Witch" id="w">witch</a> in the form of a <a href="/wiki/Serpent" id="w">serpent</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rilian" id="w">Rilian</a>, by then a young man, soon disappeared searching for her. <a href="/wiki/Eustace_Scrubb" id="w">Eustace</a> was drawn back to Narnia along with his school friend <a href="/wiki/Jill_Pole" id="w">Jill Pole</a>, to find that the passage of time meant <a href="/wiki/Caspian_X" id="w">Caspian</a> was now an <a href="/wiki/Old" id="w">old</a> <a href="/wiki/Man" id="w">man</a>, and setting off on one final voyage. The children, along with a <a href="/wiki/Marsh-wiggle" id="w">Marsh-wiggle</a> named <a href="/wiki/Puddleglum" id="w">Puddleglum</a>, were sent by <a href="/wiki/Aslan" id="w">Aslan</a> to find the lost <a href="/wiki/Prince" id="w">Prince</a>, a journey which took them to the Wild Lands of the North, inhabited by <a href="/wiki/Giant_(mythology)" id="w">giants</a>, and to the <a href="/wiki/Underworld" id="w">underworld</a> where an evil Queen had bewitched <a href="/wiki/Rilian" id="w">Rilian</a> into doing her bidding. Freeing him after ten years&#39; imprisonment and destroying the Queen in her evil <a href="/wiki/Serpent_(symbolism)" id="w">serpent</a>-form, the two children returned to Narnia to find that King Caspian, Prince Rillian&#39;s father, was dying as he was being lifted off the boat (King Caspian had sailed to the east in hope of finding advice on who should be king after him.  Aslan told him to go back to Narnia and he would find his son waiting for him).  Returning to a high mountain where Aslan blew them to Narnia in the beginning of <a href="/wiki/The_Silver_Chair" id="w">The Silver Chair</a>, the children go back to their world.  However, they were followed by the dead King Caspian after he was given permission by Aslan for five minutes in &#34;their&#34; world.  King Caspian&#39;s entering our world resolved all the problem in Experiment House.</p>
<a id="Destruction" name="Destruction"></a><h3>Destruction</h3>
<p>The world of Narnia was finally destroyed some two hundred years later during the reign of King <a href="/wiki/Tirian" id="w">Tirian</a>, son of King <a href="/wiki/Erlian" id="w">Erlian</a> and seventh in descent from <a href="/wiki/Rilian" id="w">Rilian</a>.</p>
<p>The events that culminated in its destruction were, on the surface, begun by a talking <a href="/wiki/Ape" id="w">ape</a> named <a href="/wiki/Shift_(Narnia)" id="w">Shift</a> who had constructed an elaborate <a href="/wiki/Conspiracy_(political)" id="w">conspiracy</a> in a selfish attempt to change the kingdom of Narnia to his liking. By dressing a <a href="/wiki/Donkey" id="w">donkey</a> named <a href="/wiki/Puzzle_(Narnia)" id="w">Puzzle</a> in a lion&#39;s skin and claiming him to be Aslan, Shift began surreptitiously gaining control of the western portion of the country, forcing the inhabitants to do his bidding in the lion&#39;s name. He then made contact with the current Calormen rulers, inviting them to take advantage of the situation and fulfil their centuries-old goal of conquering Narnia to their mutual advantage. A small group of soldiers under command of Captain <a href="/wiki/Rishda_Tarkaan" id="w">Rishda Tarkaan</a> was soon sent and by the time King Tirian learned of the ape&#39;s traitorous plans they were well on the way to completion.</p>
<p>With the help of Eustace and Jill (who arrived in time to rescue the king from capture), Tirian attempted to rally Narnia and drive out the invaders, but thanks to the dividing effect the false Aslan had had on the populace, and the simultaneous capture of <a href="/wiki/Cair_Paravel" id="w">Cair Paravel</a> by a Calormen fleet, his efforts were unsuccessful. Tirian and his remaining supporters were eventually forced into a last stand against Rishda&#39;s army in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Stable_Hill" id="w">Battle of Stable Hill</a>, which ended in the Narnian army&#39;s defeat. However, in the course of this final stand, the defenders were forced back into a stable, and found within it to their surprise, Aslan&#39;s country, described as all that the real Narnia ever had that was good, a Narnia-within-Narnia. This defeat of the Narnian culture and country signalled the final part of the story of Narnia which could be told, and Aslan the Lion, waiting for them, told them that it was time for the End.</p>
<p>Opening the Stable door, the children and other survivors witnessed the end of Narnia, the inrushing of the sea, the destruction of sun and moon, the coming home of the stars and ultimately the end of all that existed on the world. Aslan called all of its inhabitants to him in the process. Those who had been faithful were taken with him into his own land where they met previous people who had lived in Narnia and died. Those who had been unfaithful were turned away at the entrance to the new land. Aslan&#39;s land was bigger and better than the old Narnia, those who had died were found alive in it, because it was the &#34;real&#34; one, whereas the old Narnia had been just a copy of Aslan&#39;s land. &#34;That was the dream, this is reality.&#34; It is also indicated that Aslan&#39;s country connected &#34;further up and further in&#34; to the &#34;real&#34; England, where Lucy Pevensie was able to see her parents, who died in the same train wreck that killed all the other Pevensie siblings, except Susan, as well as Digory, Polly, Eustace, and Jill.</p>
<a id="Contact_with_our_world" name="Contact_with_our_world"></a><h3>Contact with our world</h3>
<p>There are seven documented events of contact between the world of men and the world of Narnia. Dates are taken from a timeline provided in the book <i><a href="/wiki/Past_Watchful_Dragons" id="w">Past Watchful Dragons</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Walter_Hooper" id="w">Walter Hooper</a> (<a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0020519702" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0020519702">ISBN 0-02-051970-2</a>).
</p>
<ul>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Magician%26%2339%3Bs_Nephew" id="w">The Magician&#39;s Nephew</a></i>, four humans, <a href="/wiki/King_Frank" id="w">Frank</a> (last name unknown), <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Ketterley" id="w">Andrew Ketterley</a>, and children <a href="/wiki/Digory_Kirke" id="w">Digory Kirke</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polly_Plummer" id="w">Polly Plummer</a>, were present at the creation of Narnia, having been brought there by a series of unfortunate events. The same day, Aslan called Frank&#39;s wife, <a href="/wiki/Queen_Helen" id="w">Helen</a>, from England, and the two remained in Narnia as King and Queen. The children and Andrew returned to London.</li>
<li>In Narnian Year 460, as alluded to in <i><a href="/wiki/Prince_Caspian" id="w">Prince Caspian</a></i>, six human pirates and their wives from the South Sea entered the land of <a href="/wiki/Telmar" id="w">Telmar</a> through a magic cave. They remained in Telmar and their descendants formed the Telmarine civilization.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lion%2C_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe" id="w">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a></i>, in Narnian Year 1000, four siblings, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pevensie" id="w">Peter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Susan_Pevensie" id="w">Susan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Pevensie" id="w">Edmund</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Pevensie" id="w">Lucy Pevensie</a>, entered Narnia through a wardrobe Digory had built from the wood of a magical Narnian tree. Aslan returned to Narnia at the same time, defeated the foreign ruler Jadis, now known as the <a href="/wiki/White_Witch" id="w">White Witch</a>, and set up the four children as kings and queens. They ruled for fifteen years before returning to England back in the state of their childhood.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Prince_Caspian" id="w">Prince Caspian</a></i>, in Narnian Year 2303, the Pevensie children were summoned to Narnia by magic to help remove a Telmarine usurper King Miraz from the Narnian throne and establish the teenage Prince <a href="/wiki/Caspian_X" id="w">Caspian</a> as king. After this, Aslan allowed the Telmarines, descendants of the pirates who had arrived long ago, to go back to an island in the South Sea if they so wished.</li>
<li>In <a href="/wiki/The_Voyage_of_the_Dawn_Treader" id="w">&#39;&#39;The Voyage of the &#39;&#39;Dawn Treader</a>, in Narnian Year 2306, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie and <a href="/wiki/Eustace_Scrubb" id="w">Eustace Scrubb</a> entered Narnia through a magic painting, and took part in Caspian&#39;s voyage to the edge of the world.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Silver_Chair" id="w">The Silver Chair</a></i>, in Narnian Year 2376, Aslan brought Eustace Scrubb and <a href="/wiki/Jill_Pole" id="w">Jill Pole</a> to Narnia, where they rescued <a href="/wiki/Rilian" id="w">Rilian</a>, son of the now elderly <a href="/wiki/Caspian_X" id="w">Caspian</a>, from his enchanted captivity. Caspian died, but was resurrected in Aslan&#39;s country. Aslan briefly allowed him to cross over into the children&#39;s world (England, 1942) to help them in return, which resulted in the removal of a corrupt school administrator.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Last_Battle" id="w">The Last Battle</a></i>, in 1949, King Tirian of Narnia appeared to the friends of Narnia in England, and Aslan brought Eustace and Jill to Narnia in Narnian Year 2575 to assist Tirian at the end of his reign.</li></ul>
<p>It is possible that there were other visits. Given that the darker-skinned Calormenes differed in appearance from northern peoples (like Telmarines and Archenlanders), it is possible that they are descended from another group from the world of men; however, this is not stated in the books.</p>
<a id="Monarchial_history" name="Monarchial_history"></a><h3>Monarchial history</h3>
<p>While only some kings and queens are named in the book, the custom of Narnians to name sons after fathers, as well as a <a href="/wiki/Narnian_timeline" id="w">timeline</a> that Lewis wrote outside of the series proper, helps create a fairly complete list of monarchs in the world of Narnia.
