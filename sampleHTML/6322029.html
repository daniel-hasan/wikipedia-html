<p><b><i>Goldfinger</i></b>, released in <a href="/wiki/1964_in_film" id="w">1964</a>, is the third <a href="/wiki/James_Bond_film_series" id="w">James Bond film</a>, as well as the third to star <a href="/wiki/Sean_Connery" id="w">Sean Connery</a> as <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" id="w">MI6 agent</a> <a href="/wiki/James_Bond_(character)" id="w">James Bond</a>. It is based on the <a href="/wiki/Goldfinger_(novel)" id="w">novel of the same name</a> by <a href="/wiki/Ian_Fleming" id="w">Ian Fleming</a>. The film also stars <a href="/wiki/Honor_Blackman" id="w">Honor Blackman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gert_Fr%C3%B6be" id="w">Gert Fröbe</a>. The film was produced by <a href="/wiki/Albert_R._Broccoli" id="w">Albert R. Broccoli</a> and <a href="/wiki/Harry_Saltzman" id="w">Harry Saltzman</a>, and was the first of four Bond films directed by <a href="/wiki/Guy_Hamilton" id="w">Guy Hamilton</a>. </p>
<p>The film is generally regarded as the first official Bond <a href="/wiki/Blockbuster" id="w">blockbuster</a> as well as being the template for all future Bond films; it is usually credited with triggering what is known as the &#34;James Bond craze&#34;.<sup id="_ref-making_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-making" title="">[1]</a></sup> The film made cinematic history when it recaptured its production costs in record-setting time, despite a budget equal to that of the two preceding films combined. <i>Goldfinger</i> was also the first Bond film to use a pop star to sing the theme song during the titles, which would follow for every Bond film since except <i><a href="/wiki/On_Her_Majesty%26%2339%3Bs_Secret_Service_(film)" id="w">On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-making_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-making" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h2>Plot</h2>
<p>In the pre-title sequence, James Bond destroys a Mexican drug lord&#39;s base with plastic explosives, and defeats an assassin sent to kill him by throwing him into a bath of water and knocking in a domestic heater to electrocute him; as he walks away Bond murmurs &#34;shocking...positively shocking&#34;. The main story begins in <a href="/wiki/Miami_Beach" id="w">Miami Beach</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, USA, with CIA agent Felix Leiter delivering a message to Bond from <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" id="w">M</a> to watch <a href="/wiki/Auric_Goldfinger" id="w">Auric Goldfinger</a> (<a href="/wiki/Gert_Fr%C3%B6be" id="w">Gert Fröbe</a>). Bond foils Goldfinger&#39;s cheating at <a href="/wiki/Gin_rummy" id="w">gin rummy</a>, by distracting his employee, <a href="/wiki/Jill_Masterson" id="w">Jill Masterson</a>. After  blackmailing Goldfinger into losing, Bond and Jill consummate their new relationship in Bond&#39;s hotel suite. Bond is knocked out by Goldfinger&#39;s Korean manservant Oddjob, while Jill is covered from head to toe in gold paint and succumbs to epidermal suffocation.</p>
<p>In London, Bond learns that his true mission is determining how Goldfinger transports gold internationally. He plays a high-stakes golf game with his adversary; both men cheat (Goldfinger cheats first), but Bond is better at it and wins. Goldfinger warns Bond to stay out of his business by having Oddjob decapitate a statue with his steel-rimmed <a href="/wiki/Top_hat" id="w">top hat</a>, throwing it in the same manner as a <a href="/wiki/Frisbee" id="w">Frisbee</a>. Undeterred, Bond follows him to <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>, where he unintentionally foils an attempt by Jill&#39;s sister Tilly Masterson to <a href="/wiki/Sniper" id="w">shoot</a> Goldfinger.</p>
<p>Bond sneaks into Goldfinger&#39;s plant and overhears him talking to a Red Chinese agent about &#34;Operation Grand Slam.&#34; Leaving, he encounters Tilly as she is about to make a second attempt on Goldfinger&#39;s life, but accidentally trips an alarm. During their unsuccessful attempt to escape, Tilly is killed when Oddjob breaks her neck with his hat. Goldfinger has Bond tied to a gold table underneath an industrial <a href="/wiki/Laser" id="w">laser</a>, which slowly begins to slice the table in half. But Bond lies to Goldfinger that British Intelligence knows about Grand Slam, causing Goldfinger to spare Bond&#39;s life until he can determine how much the spy actually knows.</p>
<p>Bond is transported via a private aircraft flown by Goldfinger&#39;s personal pilot, <a href="/wiki/Pussy_Galore" id="w">Pussy Galore</a> (<a href="/wiki/Honor_Blackman" id="w">Honor Blackman</a>), to Goldfinger&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" id="w">Kentucky</a> stud farm, near <a href="/wiki/Fort_Knox" id="w">Fort Knox</a>. He escapes and witnesses Goldfinger meeting U.S. mafiosi, who have brought the materials he needs for Operation Grand Slam. Bond is recaptured, but has learned enough to deduce that Goldfinger intends to irradiate the U.S. gold supply stored at the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Bullion_Depository" id="w">United States Bullion Depository</a> at Fort Knox with an &#34;<a href="/wiki/Cobalt_bomb" id="w">atomic device</a>&#34; so as to render it useless for almost 60 years, thereby greatly increasing the value of his own considerable gold holdings.</p>

<p>Operation Grand Slam begins with the women pilots of Galore&#39;s Flying Circus spraying lethal <a href="/wiki/Nerve_gas" id="w">nerve gas</a> over Fort Knox to dispatch its garrison, though Goldfinger had told Galore that the soldiers would just be rendered unconscious. However, Bond had earlier seduced her and persuaded her to contact the CIA, who had then replaced the poison with a harmless gas. Informed about this, the military personnel of Fort Knox convincingly play dead. Goldfinger&#39;s Chinese agents gain entry to the vault. Bond is then handcuffed to the atomic device and lowered into the vault with it. Goldfinger&#39;s forces are surrounded by Army personnel and wiped out; but, disguised as a US colonel, Goldfinger escapes. In the vault, Bond unlocks his handcuffs, kills Oddjob, and vainly tries to deactivate the atomic device till a specialist, who had been accompanying Leiter, runs in and stops the countdown at seven seconds; the timer indicates &#34;007&#34;.</p>
<p>With Fort Knox safe, the American President invites Bond to the <a href="/wiki/White_House" id="w">White House</a> to thank him. Bond boards a <a href="/wiki/Lockheed_JetStar" id="w">Lockheed JetStar</a> for <a href="/wiki/Washington_D.C." id="w">Washington D.C.</a>, but it is hijacked by Goldfinger. Bond and Goldfinger struggle for the latter&#39;s revolver; and the revolver fires, shattering a window; Goldfinger is blown out. Bond rescues the pilot Galore, and they parachute safely onto a beach.</p>

<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h2>Production</h2>
<p><i>Goldfinger</i> had what was then considered a large budget of <a href="/wiki/USD" id="w">$3</a> million, and was the first James Bond film classified as a box-office <a href="/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)" id="w">blockbuster</a>.<sup id="_ref-making_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-making" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Richard_Maibaum" id="w">Richard Maibaum</a>, who had adapted two of <a href="/wiki/Ian_Fleming" id="w">Ian Fleming</a>&#39;s novels for the first two Bond films &#8211; <i><a href="/wiki/Dr._No_(film)" id="w">Dr. No</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/From_Russia_with_Love_(film)" id="w">From Russia With Love</a></i> &#8211; returned to adapt the <a href="/wiki/Goldfinger_(novel)" id="w">seventh James Bond novel</a>. However, <a href="/wiki/Harry_Saltzman" id="w">Harry Saltzman</a> disliked the first draft, and brought in <a href="/wiki/Paul_Dehn" id="w">Paul Dehn</a> to revise it. Connery disliked his draft, so Maibaum returned. In addition, <a href="/wiki/Guy_Hamilton" id="w">Guy Hamilton</a> replaced <a href="/wiki/Terence_Young" id="w">Terence Young</a> as director. Young, who directed the previous films, decided to direct <i><a href="/wiki/The_Amorous_Adventures_of_Moll_Flanders" id="w">The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders</a></i> (1965). Hamilton felt that he needed to make Bond less of a &#34;superman&#34;, and wanted to focus on the villains. The plot was changed from the novel, in which Goldfinger actually attempts to empty Fort Knox. This was apparently a reaction to criticism of the novel: Bond notes in the film it would take twelve days for Goldfinger to steal the gold, before being told that he actually intends to irradiate it.<sup id="_ref-thrill_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thrill" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Goldfinger</i> was the first Bond film with the budget to showcase unique technology that became a staple of the film series.<sup id="_ref-making_p" class="reference"><a href="#_note-making" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Production_designer" id="w">Production designer</a> Ken Adam worked with special effects supervisor John Stears to overhaul the prototype of the Aston Martin DB5 coupe, Bond&#39;s first company car.<sup id="_ref-making_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-making" title="">[1]</a></sup> Pneumatic mechanics were used to simulate machine guns hidden behind the front turn signals; smokescreen and oil dispensers were fitted behind the rear signal lights (though they had to be removed to emplace a large bulletproof shield in the rear of the vehicle); revolving licence plates were fitted in the front and rear bumpers (a feature developed by the film&#39;s director); a tire-slashing apparatus that was meant to extend from a wheel depicted to have been a feature of the actual vehicle, was actually a separate rig filmed in a studio; the front passenger seat was turned into an ejector seat, operated by a compressed air mechanism that could be fired by a hidden button in the gearshift. All of these features were created and installed in the course of six weeks.<sup id="_ref-making_r" class="reference"><a href="#_note-making" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other features including front and rear projecting overriders for ramming other vehicles, a weapons tray hidden beneath the driver&#39;s seat (that has never been seen in a film), a nail chamber fitted behind the rear signal lights to dispense clustered spikes, and a radio telephone concealed behind the driver&#39;s door paneling &#8211; were added to the DB5, but were not used in the film.<sup id="_ref-making_s" class="reference"><a href="#_note-making" title="">[1]</a></sup> Two cars were used during production, one which had no gadgets installed.

<p><a href="/wiki/Laser" id="w">Lasers</a> did not exist in 1959 when the book was written, and they were a novelty in the movie. The Bond set uses a scaled-up prop which visually suggests the original 1960 <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Maiman" id="w">Theodore H. Maiman</a> ruby-crystal laser, complete with coiled external flashlamp, and the beam is red. However, in the movie the laser beam is continuous, which is never the case with the 1960 flashlamp design. Reportedly the film prop actually used a low-powered helium-neon continuous beam <a href="/wiki/Gas_laser" id="w">gas laser</a>, but the beam didn&#39;t show on the film, so it had to be added as an optical special effect. The effect on the table is simulated by a welder cutting through it from below with an <a href="/wiki/Oxyacetylene" id="w">oxyacetylene</a> torch. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a saw to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers changed it to a laser to make the film feel more fresh.<sup id="_ref-thrill_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thrill" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
