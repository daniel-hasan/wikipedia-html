The episode begins with the <a href="/wiki/Simpson_family" id="w">Simpson family</a> visiting a <a href="/wiki/Renaissance_fair" id="w">renaissance fair</a>. <a href="/wiki/Homer_Simpson" id="w">Homer</a> eats eight different kinds of meat and an ashamed <a href="/wiki/Lisa_Simpson" id="w">Lisa</a> wanders off and eventually finds a <a href="/wiki/Fortune_telling" id="w">fortune telling</a> booth. Although Lisa is at first skeptical, the fortune teller manages to name Lisa&#39;s entire family and then tells Lisa of her first true love.</p>
<p>The story then shifts to an Eastern University in the year 2010 (at the time the episode aired, 15 years in the future) where a now 23 year old Lisa becomes annoyed by a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a>  student named Hugh Parkfield. At first, the two quarrel over a book in the library, but the pair eventually fall madly in love. The two discover they have a lot in common and Hugh invites Lisa to come back to his home in England so she can meet his parents. Hugh asks Lisa to marry him and she immediately accepts. </p>
<p>The next day, Lisa calls home to tell <a href="/wiki/Marge_Simpson" id="w">Marge</a> of the news and Marge promises that she will prevent Homer from ruining the wedding. Marge is still a housewife, <a href="/wiki/Bart_Simpson" id="w">Bart</a> works as a twice divorced building demolition expert and plans on going to law school, <a href="/wiki/Maggie_Simpson" id="w">Maggie</a> is a teenager who apparently never shuts up (although she never talks in the episode) and Homer still works at the <a href="/wiki/Springfield_Nuclear_Power_Plant" id="w">Springfield Nuclear Power Plant</a> in Sector 7G with <a href="/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten" id="w">Milhouse</a> as his supervisor. Lisa and Hugh travel to <a href="/wiki/Springfield_(The_Simpsons)" id="w">Springfield</a> where Lisa is worried that her family will embarrass her and things get off to a bad start when Bart and Homer accidentally set the <a href="/wiki/Union_Flag" id="w">British Union Jack flag</a> on fire.</p>
<p>At dinner, Lisa plans on going for a wedding dress fitting and Homer decides to take Hugh out on the town to <a href="/wiki/Moe%26%2339%3Bs_Tavern" id="w">Moe&#39;s Tavern</a>. Homer presents Hugh with a pair of tacky cuff links and Hugh grudgingly agrees to wear them during his wedding. Later that night, Lisa apologizes profusely for the behaviour of her family and although Hugh says it was nothing, he stays up thinking.</p>
<p>On the day of the wedding, Homer talks with Lisa and she discovers that Hugh did not wear Homer&#39;s cuff links. She finds Hugh and asks him to wear them. He agrees, but says that after the wedding they will return to England and never see her family again. Lisa is outraged and calls off the wedding. </p>
<p>Back in the present once more, the fortune teller says that Hugh went back to England and never saw Lisa again and that there was nothing Lisa could do to prevent it - although she should &#34;try to look surprised&#34;. Lisa questions the fortune teller about her &#34;true love&#34; and the fortune teller reveals that although Lisa will have a true love, she &#34;specializes in foretelling relationships where you get jerked around.&#34; Lisa leaves the booth and finds her father, who brags about his day at the fair and Lisa listens raptly as the two walk off.<sup id="_ref-officialsite_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialsite" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-SNPP_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SNPP" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-book_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-book" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Simpsguide_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Simpsguide" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The idea for the episode came from <a href="/wiki/James_L._Brooks" id="w">James L. Brooks</a>, who called David Mirkin and pitched the idea as travelling to the future and Lisa meeting the perfect guy, who in turn can not stand her family.<sup id="_ref-Mirkin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mirkin" title="">[5]</a></sup> Believing that it would be a tough episode to write, the job was given to <a href="/wiki/Greg_Daniels" id="w">Greg Daniels</a>, who was enthusiastic about it and has said that was a lot easier and more fun to write than expected.<sup id="_ref-Daniels_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Daniels" title="">[6]</a></sup> The part involving Homer&#39;s cuff links was not in the original draft, it was later added because the writers felt that something was needed to represent Hugh&#39;s dislike of the Simpson family.<sup id="_ref-Daniels_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Daniels" title="">[6]</a></sup> The end theme was redone by <a href="/wiki/Alf_Clausen" id="w">Alf Clausen</a> as a &#34;Renaissance version&#34; including a harp.<sup id="_ref-Mirkin_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mirkin" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Everything in the episode had to be redesigned, which included new sets and all of the characters had to be remodelled for their age.<sup id="_ref-Mirkin_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mirkin" title="">[5]</a></sup> In most cases, the adults were made heavier, had a few lines added to the face and less hair. On Homer, the redesign was minimal, making him a bit heavier, removing one hair and placing an extra line under the eye.<sup id="_ref-Mirkin_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mirkin" title="">[5]</a></sup> Krusty&#39;s design is based on <a href="/wiki/Groucho_Marx" id="w">Groucho Marx</a>.<sup id="_ref-Daniels_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Daniels" title="">[6]</a></sup> The night sky was intentionally made a more reddish colour in a subtle joke about how the producers thought the world would be much more polluted in 2010.<sup id="_ref-Mirkin_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mirkin" title="">[5]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Nancy_Cartwright" id="w">Nancy Cartwright</a>&#39;s Bart voice was electronically lowered a couple of notches.<sup id="_ref-Mirkin_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mirkin" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>This is the first of three future-themed episodes. The second was &#34;<a href="/wiki/Bart_to_the_Future" id="w">Bart to the Future</a>&#34; in <a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons_(season_11)" id="w">season 11</a> and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Future-Drama" id="w">Future-Drama</a>&#34; in <a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons_(season_16)" id="w">season 16</a>. All three have been separated by five year margins. While both &#34;Lisa&#39;s Wedding&#34; and &#34;Future-Drama&#34; were nominated for an Emmy, <a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" id="w">Entertainment Weekly</a> named &#34;Bart to the Future&#34; the worst episode ever.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
