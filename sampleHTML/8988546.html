His speech is featured in the documentary.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>    </p>
<p>Abbie Hoffman appears as a commentator in the documentary, and addresses some of the points raised in Davis&#39; speech, stating:  &#34;It&#39;s rather arrogant of Rennie to say that he has found God and has his Telex number in his wallet.&#34;<sup id="_ref-adler_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-adler" title="">[6]</a></sup>  The TVTV crew interviewed different &#34;premies&#34;, or followers of Prem Rawat, throughout the film, and one teen-aged boy was quoted as stating: &#34;Before I came to the Guru I was a freak, smoking dope and dropping out - and my parents were happier then than they are with this.&#34;<sup id="_ref-adler_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-adler" title="">[6]</a></sup>  In a later part of the film, a loudspeaker voice announces: &#34;Those premies who came in private cars can leave now..Those who came in rented buses can stay and meditate until further notice.&#34;<sup id="_ref-subtle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-subtle" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-adler_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-adler" title="">[6]</a></sup>  Adherents of other belief systems also have <a href="/wiki/Cameo" id="w">cameo</a> appearances in the documentary, including a born again Christian who criticizes devotees for &#34;following the devil,&#34; and a Hare Krishna follower.<sup id="_ref-boylerevisited_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boylerevisited" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>A separate storyline is seen concurrently through the coverage of the &#34;Millenium &#39;73&#34; event, involving a man named Michael who has come to <a href="/wiki/Houston%2C_Texas" id="w">Houston, Texas</a> to receive <a href="/wiki/Teachings_of_Prem_Rawat" id="w">&#34;Knowledge&#34;</a> from Maharaj Ji.  Once Michael has received the &#34;Knowledge&#34;, he defends the secrecy behind the rituals.  Michael&#39;s experiences are contrasted in the documentary with interviews with &#34;ex-premies&#34; or former followers of Maharaj Ji, recounting their initiation and later disillusionment with Maharaj Ji&#39;s teachings.  One of them says after receiving &#34;Knowledge&#34; from Maharaj Ji, he was told that this free gift required lifetime devotion and donations of &#34;worldly goods&#34;.<sup id="_ref-boylerevisited_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boylerevisited" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Maharaj Ji is shown in a scene in the Astrodome relating a <i><a href="/wiki/Satsang" id="w">satsang</a></i> to the attendants.  He is seen dressed in gold-colored clothing and a crown, and sits on a platform throne.  The story he relates to the crowd involves a young boy who comes to Houston, while searching for a <a href="/wiki/Superman" id="w">Superman</a> <a href="/wiki/Comic_book" id="w">comic book</a>.

</p><a id="Awards" name="Awards"></a><h3> Awards </h3>
<p>The documentary received the 1974 &#34;Alfred I. du Pont/Columbia University Award in Broadcast Journalism&#34;   (DuPont Award).<sup id="_ref-vdb_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vdb" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-intermix_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-intermix" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dupont_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dupont" title="">[15]</a></sup>  The jurors from the 1974 DuPont-Columbia awards stated that the documentary was: &#34;hectic, hilarious and not a little disquieting. With a heavier and less sure hand, the subject would have been squashed beneath the reporters’ irony or contempt. As it was, cult religion was handed to us, live and quivering, to make of it what we would.&#34;<sup id="_ref-dupont_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dupont" title="">[15]</a></sup>  The group’s work impressed WNET president <a href="/wiki/John_Jay_Iselin" id="w">John Jay Iselin</a>, and he raised additional funds which helped TVTV to produce five more programs, including <i>Gerald Ford’s America</i>.<sup id="_ref-video history project_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-video history project" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Reviews" name="Reviews"></a><h3> Reviews </h3>
<p>The documentary received mostly positive reviews, but did receive some criticism in the <i>New York Post</i>, where Bob Williams called it a &#34;deplorable film&#34; and &#34;flat, pointless, television&#34;.  He wrote: &#34;The hour-long program was remiss in not providing some small examination of the available box-office take of the goofy kid guru, much less telling prospective contributors how it got involved in spending how much of its foundation grants and viewer subscription money in such a questionable venture without more inquisitive journalistic endeavor, or ignoring gurus.&#34;<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>  Katy Butler writing in the <i>San Francisco Bay Guardian</i> stated that the TVTV style had improved since their previous work, noting: &#34;This show has fewer interjections from TVTV personnel, fewer moments that drag, more technological razzle-dazzle (color footage, slow motion, stop motion, tight and rapid cutting).&#34;  However, she also described Guru Maharaji and his entourage as &#34;an easy target,&#34; and wrote that &#34;anybody can look like a fool when a smartass wide angle lens distorts their face, and teenage ex-dopers who think a fat boy is God don&#39;t stand a chance.&#34;  Butler wished that TVTV would move on to more challenging subjects for their future work.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>John J. O&#39;Connor, of <i>The New York Times</i> described TVTV&#39;s work as &#34;a terrific documentary,&#34; and complimented the team on the visual results of the piece, noting: &#34;After TVTV superbly dissected the guru, his &#39;holy family&#39; and his followers, more objective viewers might have chosen to laugh, cry, or throw up.&#34;<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup>  Ron Powers of the <i>Chicago Sun Times</i> called the documentary &#34;highly recommended viewing,&#34; and described it as: &#34;..both as an example of skeptical, unimpressed (but never vicious) journalism, and as a peek into the future of television...a clever, ironic and eventually devastating documentary.&#34;<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup>  <i>Electronic Arts Intermix</i> described <i>Lord of the Universe</i> as &#34;a forceful expose on the sixteen-year-old Guru Maharaj Ji and the national gathering of his followers at the Houston Astrodome.&#34;<sup id="_ref-intermix_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-intermix" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Dick Adler of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> also gave the documentary a positive review, writing: &#34;&#39;The Lord of the Universe&#39; doesn&#39;t really take sides, which doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a bland hour trying to please everybody.  It&#39;s considerable bite comes first from the material TVTV so carefully gathered and there from the artfully wise frame in which it chose to present it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-adler_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-adler" title="">[6]</a></sup>  Deirdre Boyle wrote in <i>Art Journal</i> that the piece was &#34;the zenith of TVTV&#39;s guerrilla-TV style.&#34;<sup id="_ref-boyle_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boyle" title="">[9]</a></sup> According to Boyle&#39;s <i>Subject to Change: Guerrilla Television Revisited</i>, as in all TVTV tapes, everyone in the documentary comes across as foolish, describing the production&#39;s sarcasm as the &#34;ultimate leveler&#34; using equal irony  &#34;both with the mighty and the lowly.&#34;<sup id="_ref-boylerevisited_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boylerevisited" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
