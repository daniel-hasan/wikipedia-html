<p>Son of Madhabram Sen of Panchdona, <a href="/wiki/Dhaka_District" id="w">Dhaka</a> in <a href="/wiki/Bengal" id="w">Bengal</a> (now part of <a href="/wiki/Narayanganj_District" id="w">Narayanganj District</a> in <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh" id="w">Bangladesh</a>), he learnt Persian and Sanskrit in early life and started working as a copywriter in the court of the deputy magistrate in <a href="/wiki/Mymensingh_District" id="w">Mymensingh</a>. He was attracted to the <a href="/wiki/Brahmo_Samaj" id="w">Brahmo Samaj</a> under the influence of <a href="/wiki/Keshub_Chunder_Sen" id="w">Keshub Chunder Sen</a> and Bijay Krishna Goswami and joined it as a missionary in 1871. </p>
<p>In 1869, Keshub Chunder Sen chose from amongst his missionaries, four persons and ordained them as adhyapaks or professors of four old religions of the world. He was selected to study <a href="/wiki/Islam" id="w">Islam</a>. Others selected to study different religions were <a href="/wiki/Gour_Govinda_Ray" id="w">Gour Govinda Ray</a> for Hinduism, <a href="/wiki/Protap_Chandra_Mozoomdar" id="w">Protap Chandra Mozoomdar</a> for Christianity, and <a href="/wiki/Aghore_Nath_Gupta" id="w">Aghore Nath Gupta</a> for Buddhism. A firm believer in the basic unity of all religions, he immersed himself in his studies and later went to Lucknow to study Arabic and the Islamic religious texts. He was involved in intense studies for about five years.</p>

<p>On completion of his studies, he returned to <a href="/wiki/Kolkata" id="w">Kolkata</a> and engaged in translation of Islamic scriptures. After hard labour of six years from 1881-1886, he produced an annotated Bengali version of the holy <a href="/wiki/Qur%E2%80%99an" id="w">Qur’an</a>. Apart from this, he translated from original Persian religious books such as the teachings of <i>Golestan</i> and <i>Bostan</i> (see <a href="/wiki/Saadi" id="w">Saadi</a>), <i>Hadis</i> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.quran.net/hadis.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.quran.net/hadis.htm">http://www.quran.net/hadis.htm</a> and the life of <a href="/wiki/Muhammad" id="w">Prophet Muhammad</a>, <a href="/wiki/Khalifa" id="w">Khalifas</a> and 96 pious souls. In all he wrote and published 42 such books in Bengali. Muslim society, in his days, respected him enormously and called him a Maulavi. <i>Bostan</i> (The Rose Garden) consists of stories aptly illustrating the standard virtues recommended to Muslims, as well as reflections on the behaviour of dervishes and their ecstatic practices. <i>Golestan</i> (The Orchard) contains stories and personal anecdotes. These were used as textbooks and were frequently reprinted.  </p>
