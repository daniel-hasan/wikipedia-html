<a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>After the Industrial Revolution, the <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scottish</a> economy concentrated on heavy industry, dominated by the <a href="/wiki/Shipbuilding" id="w">shipbuilding</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coal_mining" id="w">coal mining</a> and <a href="/wiki/Steel" id="w">steel</a> industries. Scottish participation in the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British Empire</a> also allowed the Scottish economy to export its output throughout the world. However heavy industry declined in the latter part of the 20th century leading to a remarkable shift in the economy of Scotland towards a technology and service sector based economy. The 1980s saw an economic boom in the <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Glen" id="w">Silicon Glen</a> corridor between <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" id="w">Glasgow</a> and <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" id="w">Edinburgh</a>, with many large technology firms relocating to Scotland. Today the industry employs over 41,000 people. Scottish-based companies have strengths in information systems, defence, electronics, instrumentation and semi-conductors. There is also a dynamic and fast growing electronics design and development industry, based around links between the <a href="/wiki/Education_in_Scotland" id="w">universities</a> and indigenous companies like <a href="/wiki/Wolfson_Microelectronics" id="w">Wolfson</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>, <a href="/wiki/4i2i_Communications" id="w">4i2i</a><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>, <a href="/wiki/Linn_Products" id="w">Linn</a>, Nallatech<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> and Axeon<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>. There is also a significant presence of global players like <a href="/wiki/National_Semiconductor" id="w">National Semiconductor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Motorola" id="w">Motorola</a>. Other major industries include <a href="/wiki/Banking" id="w">banking</a> and <a href="/wiki/Financial_services" id="w">financial services</a>, <a href="/wiki/Education" id="w">education</a>, <a href="/wiki/Entertainment" id="w">entertainment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biotechnology" id="w">biotechnology</a>, transport equipment, <a href="/wiki/Oil" id="w">oil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gas" id="w">gas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Whisky" id="w">whisky</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tourism" id="w">tourism</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Gross_Domestic_Product" id="w">Gross Domestic Product</a> (GDP) of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> was measured at just over £86.3 billion (€126 billion, $170 billion) by the <a href="/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics" id="w">Office for National Statistics</a> in 2005<a class="externallink" href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/regional_snapshot_2006/SubregionalGVA.xls" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/regional_snapshot_2006/SubregionalGVA.xls">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/regional_snapshot_2006/SubregionalGVA.xls</a>, giving a per capita GDP of £16,944 (€24,792, $33,460).

<p>Edinburgh is the financial services centre of Scotland and the sixth largest centre in Europe, with many large financial firms based there, including the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Scotland" id="w">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> (the second largest bank in Europe), <a href="/wiki/HBOS_plc" id="w">HBOS</a> (owners of the <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_Scotland" id="w">Bank of Scotland</a>) and Standard Life Insurance. Glasgow is Scotland&#39;s leading seaport and is the fourth largest manufacturing centre in the UK, accounting for well over 60% of Scotland&#39;s manufactured exports. Shipbuilding, although significantly diminished from its heights in the early 20th century, is still a large part of the Glasgow economy. The city has the UK&#39;s largest and most economically important commerce and retail district after London&#39;s West End. Glasgow is also one of Europe&#39;s top 20 financial centres and is home to many of the UK&#39;s leading companies. Other important industries include textile production, chemicals, distilling, brewing and fishing.</p>
<a id="Natural_Resources" name="Natural_Resources"></a><h2>Natural Resources</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> has a large abundance of natural resources from fertile land, suitable for agriculture, to oil and gas. In terms of mineral resources, Scotland produces <a href="/wiki/Coal" id="w">coal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zinc" id="w">zinc</a>, iron, <a href="/wiki/Oil_shale" id="w">oil shale</a>. The coal seams beneath central <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>, in particular in <a href="/wiki/Ayrshire" id="w">Ayrshire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fife" id="w">Fife</a> contributed significantly to the industrialisation of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> during the 19th century. The mining of coal - once a major employer in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> has declined in importance since the latter half of the 20th century, due to cheaper foreign coal and the exhaustion of many seams. The last deep-coal mine continues to operate at <a href="/wiki/Longannet" id="w">Longannet</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Firth_of_Forth" id="w">Firth of Forth</a>.</p>
<a id="Agriculture_and_forestry" name="Agriculture_and_forestry"></a><h3>Agriculture and forestry</h3>

<p>Only about one quarter of the land is under cultivation - mainly in cereals. <a href="/wiki/Barley" id="w">Barley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wheat" id="w">wheat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Potatoes" id="w">potatoes</a> are grown in eastern parts of Scotland such as Fife and the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Borders" id="w">Scottish Borders</a>. The Tayside and <a href="/wiki/Angus" id="w">Angus</a> area is a centre of production of soft fruits such as <a href="/wiki/Strawberries" id="w">strawberries</a>, <a href="/wiki/Raspberries" id="w">raspberries</a> and <a href="/wiki/Loganberry" id="w">loganberries</a>, owing to the mild climate.  Sheep raising is important in the less arable mountainous regions, such as the northwest of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> which are used for rough grazing, due to its geographical isolation, poor <a href="/wiki/Climate" id="w">climate</a> and acidic soils. Parts of the east of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> (areas such as <a href="/wiki/Aberdeenshire" id="w">Aberdeenshire</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fife" id="w">Fife</a> and <a href="/wiki/Angus" id="w">Angus</a>) are major centres of <a href="/wiki/Cereal" id="w">cereal</a> production and general cropping. In such areas, the land is generally flatter, <a href="/wiki/Coastal" id="w">coastal</a>, and the climate less harsh, and more suited to <a href="/wiki/Cultivation" id="w">cultivation</a>. The south-west of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> - principally  <a href="/wiki/Ayrshire" id="w">Ayrshire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dumfries_and_Galloway" id="w">Dumfries and Galloway</a> - is a centre of <a href="/wiki/Dairying" id="w">dairying</a>. <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" id="w">Agriculture</a>, especially <a href="/wiki/Crop_(agriculture)" id="w">cropping</a> in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>, is highly mechanised and generally efficient. Farms tend to cover larger areas than their European counterparts. Hill farming is also prominent in the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Uplands" id="w">Southern Uplands</a> in the south of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>, resulting in the production of <a href="/wiki/Wool" id="w">wool</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lamb" id="w">lamb</a> and mutton. Cattle-Rearing particularly in the east and south of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> results in the production of large amounts of <a href="/wiki/Beef" id="w">beef</a>. Farming in Scotland has been particularly hard hit in recent years and is still recovering from the effects of the <a href="/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy" id="w">BSE</a> and the European ban on the importation of British beef from 1996. Dairy and Cattle farmers in south-west Scotland were affected by the <a href="/wiki/2001_UK_foot_and_mouth_crisis" id="w">2001 UK Foot and Mouth outbreak</a>, which resulted in the destruction of much of their livestock as part of the <a href="/wiki/Biosecurity" id="w">biosecurity</a> effort to control the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>Because of the persistence of feudalism and the land enclosures of the 19th century the ownership of most land is concentrated in relatively few hands (some 350 people own about half the land). In 2003, as a result, the Scottish Parliament passed a land reform act that empowered tenant farmers and communities to purchase land even if the landlord did not want to sell.</p>
<p>About 13,340 km² of land in Scotland is forested <a class="externallink" href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcfs205.pdf/$FILE/fcfs205.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcfs205.pdf/$FILE/fcfs205.pdf">http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcfs205.pdf/$FILE/fcfs205.pdf</a> - this represents around 15% of the total land area of Scotland. The majority of forests are in public ownership, with forestry policy being controlled by the <a href="/wiki/Forestry_Commission" id="w">Forestry Commission</a>. The biggest plantations and timber resources are to be found in <a href="/wiki/Dumfries_and_Galloway" id="w">Dumfries and Galloway</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tayside" id="w">Tayside</a>, <a href="/wiki/Argyll" id="w">Argyll</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Highlands" id="w">Scottish Highlands</a>. The economic activities generated by forestry in Scotland include planting and harvesting as well as sawmilling, the production of pulp and paper and the manufacture of higher value goods. Forests, especially those surrounding populated areas in Central Scotland also provide a recreation resource.</p>
<a id="Fishing" name="Fishing"></a><h3>Fishing</h3>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The waters surrounding Scotland are some of the richest in <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>. Fishing is an economic mainstay in parts of the North East of Scotland and along the west coast, with important fish markets in places such as <a href="/wiki/Aberdeen" id="w">Aberdeen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mallaig" id="w">Mallaig</a>. Fish such as <a href="/wiki/Herring" id="w">herring</a>, <a href="/wiki/Crab" id="w">crab</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lobster" id="w">lobster</a>, <a href="/wiki/Haddock" id="w">haddock</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cod" id="w">cod</a> are landed at ports such as <a href="/wiki/Fraserburgh" id="w">Fraserburgh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stornoway" id="w">Stornoway</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lerwick" id="w">Lerwick</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oban" id="w">Oban</a>. There has been a large scale decrease in employment in the fishing industry within Scotland due to the <a href="/wiki/EU" id="w">EU</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Common_Fisheries_Policy" id="w">Common Fisheries Policy</a>, which places restrictions on the total tonnage of catch that can be landed, caused by overfishing in the <a href="/wiki/North_Sea" id="w">North Sea</a> and parts of the <a href="/wiki/North_Atlantic" id="w">North Atlantic</a>. In tandem with the decline of sea-fishing, commercial fish farms - especially in <a href="/wiki/Salmon" id="w">salmon</a>, have increased in prominence in the <a href="/wiki/Rivers" id="w">rivers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lochs" id="w">lochs</a> of the north and west of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>.

<p>The electronics industry in Scotland <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Glen" id="w">Silicon Glen</a> is the phrase that is used to describe the growth and development of Scotland&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Hi-tech" id="w">hi-tech</a> and electronics industries in the <a href="/wiki/Central_Lowlands" id="w">Central Belt</a> through the 1980s and 1990s, analogous to the larger concentration of hi-tech industries in <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Valley" id="w">Silicon Valley</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>. Companies such as <a href="/wiki/IBM" id="w">IBM</a> (which maintains a plant at <a href="/wiki/Greenock" id="w">Greenock</a> near <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" id="w">Glasgow</a>) have been in Scotland since the 1950&#39;s being joined in the 1980&#39;s by others such as <a href="/wiki/Sun_Microsystems" id="w">Sun Microsystems</a> at <a href="/wiki/Linlithgow" id="w">Linlithgow</a>. 45,000 people are employed by electronics and electronics-related firms, accounting for 12% of manufacturing output. Today, Scotland produces 28% of <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>’s PCs; more than seven per cent of the world’s <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer" id="w">PCs</a>; and 29% of Europe’s notebooks.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Textiles" name="Textiles"></a><h3>Textiles</h3>

<p>Historically textiles were a large employer in Scotland in places such as the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Borders" id="w">Scottish Borders</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shetland" id="w">Shetland</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Hebrides" id="w">Outer Hebrides</a> - areas where there is much production of wool. <a href="/wiki/Knitwear" id="w">Knitwear</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tweed" id="w">tweed</a> are traditionally seen as cottage industries but names like <a href="/wiki/Pringle_of_Scotland" id="w">Pringle</a> have given Scottish knitwear and apparel a presence on the international market. Despite increasing competition from low-cost textile producers in SE <a href="/wiki/Asia" id="w">Asia</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Indian_subcontinent" id="w">Indian subcontinent</a>, textiles in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> is still a major employer with a workforce of around 22,000. Furthermore the textiles industry is the 7th largest exporter in Scotland accounting for over 3% of all Scottish manufactured products<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Exports" name="Exports"></a><h3>Exports</h3>
<p>In 2004, total Scottish exports (excluding intra-UK trade) was provisionally estimated to be £17.5 billion, of which 70% (£12.2 billion) were attributable to manufacturing. The largest export products for Scotland are <a href="/wiki/Whisky" id="w">whisky</a>, electronics, and financial services. <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>
</p><a id="Major_Trading_Partners" name="Major_Trading_Partners"></a><h3>Major Trading Partners</h3>
<p>Excluding intra UK trade, the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and the <a href="/wiki/EU" id="w">EU</a> constitute the largest markets for Scotland&#39;s exports. As part of the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" id="w">European Union</a>, Scotland fully participates in the <a href="/wiki/Single_Market" id="w">Single Market</a> and <a href="/wiki/Free_Trade_Area" id="w">Free Trade Area</a> which exists across all EU member states and regions.

<p>Banking in Scotland has a long history, beginning with the creation of the <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_Scotland" id="w">Bank of Scotland</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" id="w">Edinburgh</a>, in 1695. Today <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> is home to 4 clearing banks - the <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_Scotland" id="w">Bank of Scotland</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Scotland" id="w">Royal Bank of Scotland</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Clydesdale_Bank" id="w">Clydesdale Bank</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lloyds_TSB_Scotland" id="w">Lloyds TSB Scotland</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Scotland" id="w">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> which is the second largest bank in <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>, fifth largest in the world by <a href="/wiki/Market_capitalisation" id="w">market capitalisation</a> and has significant international operations recently opened its new global headquarters in <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" id="w">Edinburgh</a> augmenting the city&#39;s position as a major financial centre. Many other international banks are beginning to operate bases in Scotland, as the sector expands. In 2005 <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> ranked second only to <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> in the European league of headquarters locations of the 30 largest banks in <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> as measured by market value <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Finance in Scotland also features unique characteristics. Although the <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_England" id="w">Bank of England</a> remains the central bank for the UK Government, three Scottish clearing banks still issue their own <a href="/wiki/Banknote" id="w">banknotes</a>: (the <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_Scotland" id="w">Bank of Scotland</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Scotland" id="w">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Clydesdale_Bank" id="w">Clydesdale Bank</a>).

The full range of Scottish bank notes commonly accepted are £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100. (See <a href="/wiki/British_banknotes" id="w">British banknotes</a> for further discussion).</p>
<p>Centered primarily on the cities of <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" id="w">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" id="w">Glasgow</a>, the development of financial services industry in the Scottish Economy, has taken place over the last 10 to 20 years. The sector makes a significant contribution to the economy employing 5% of the Scottish workforce or 113,160 people and generating £5bn or 6% of Scotland&#39;s GDP <sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup>. The financial services industry in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> is also one of its fastest growing areas with a growth rate of over 35% over the period 2000 to 2005 <sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>.</p>
<a id="Investment%2C_Insurance_and_Asset_Servicing" name="Investment%2C_Insurance_and_Asset_Servicing"></a><h3>Investment, Insurance and Asset Servicing</h3>

<p>Scotland is one of the world&#39;s biggest fund management centres with over £300bn worth of assets directly serviced or managed in the country. <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>. Scottish fund management centres have a major presence in areas such as pensions, property funds, investment trusts as well as in retail and private client markets.

<p>It is estimated that tourism accounts for 3% of Scotland&#39;s economic output. <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> is a well-developed tourist destination with attractions ranging from unspoilt countryside, <a href="/wiki/Mountains_and_hills_of_Scotland" id="w">mountains</a> and abundant <a href="/wiki/History_of_Scotland" id="w">history</a>. <a href="/wiki/Tourism" id="w">Tourism</a> is responsible for sustaining 200,000 jobs mainly in the service sector, with tourist spending averaging at £4bn per year <sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>.

<p>Infrastructure in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> is varied in its provision and its quality. The densest network of <a href="/wiki/Roads" id="w">roads</a>, <a href="/wiki/Railways" id="w">railways</a> and <a href="/wiki/Motorways" id="w">motorways</a> is concentrated in the <a href="/wiki/Central_Belt" id="w">Central Lowlands</a> of the country where around 70% of the population live. The motorway and trunk road network is principally centred on  the cities of <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" id="w">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" id="w">Glasgow</a> and connecting them to other major concentrations of population, and is vitally important to the economy of Scotland. Key routes include the <a href="/wiki/M8_motorway" id="w">M8 motorway</a>, which is one of the busiest and most important major routes in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>, with other primary routes such as the <a href="/wiki/A9_road" id="w">A9</a> connecting the <a href="/wiki/Highlands_of_Scotland" id="w">Highlands</a> to the Central Belt, and the <a href="/wiki/A90_road" id="w">A90</a>/<a href="/wiki/M90_motorway" id="w">M90</a> connecting <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" id="w">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aberdeen" id="w">Aberdeen</a> in the east. The <a href="/wiki/M74_motorway" id="w">M74</a> and <a href="/wiki/A1_road" id="w">A1</a>, in the west and east of the country, respectively, provide the main road corridors from <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> to <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Executive" id="w">Scottish Executive</a> has stated that it intends to spend £3bn on a capital investment scheme to improve Scotland&#39;s road and rail system, over the next decade <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup>, with the setting up of a national agency in January 2006 - <a href="/wiki/Transport_Scotland" id="w">Transport Scotland</a> to oversee this. Many roads in the Highlands are single track, with passing places.</p>
<p>The rail network is primarily centred on the central belt and is used principally as a means of public transport, with some freight movements - for example from the port facilities at <a href="/wiki/Grangemouth" id="w">Grangemouth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hunterston_Ore_Terminal" id="w">Hunterston Ore Terminal</a>. After a large rationalisation of routes in the 1960s, which led to station and line closures, the rail network is currently being expanded, to cope with ever increasing levels of passenger demand. The rail-operator <a href="/wiki/First_ScotRail" id="w">First ScotRail</a> operates most routes within Scotland, with long-distance connections to <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> operated by <a href="/wiki/GNER" id="w">GNER</a> or <a href="/wiki/Virgin_Trains" id="w">Virgin Trains</a>. Proposals which have been mooted include the construction of a high-speed <a href="/wiki/MAGLEV" id="w">MAGLEV</a> rail system connecting <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" id="w">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" id="w">Glasgow</a> which, it estimated, will cut journey times between the two cities by around 30 minutes <sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup>. Other measures suggested include the <a href="/wiki/Electrification" id="w">electrification</a> of the rail system in order to cut journey times.</p>
<p>In 2004, 22.6 million passengers used Scotland&#39;s airports, with their being 514,000 aircraft movements <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> with Scottish airports being amongst the fastest growing in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> in terms of passenger numbers. Plans have been published by the major airport operator <a href="/wiki/BAA_plc" id="w">BAA plc</a> to facilitate the expansion of capacity at the major international airports of <a href="/wiki/Glasgow_International_Airport" id="w">Glasgow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh_International_Airport" id="w">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aberdeen_Airport" id="w">Aberdeen</a>, including new terminals and runways to cope with a large forecasted rise in passenger use. <a href="/wiki/Prestwick_International_Airport" id="w">Prestwick Airport</a> also has large air freight operations and cargo handling facilities.

<p><i>See also: <a href="/wiki/Politics_of_Scotland" id="w">Politics of Scotland</a></i></p>
<p>The public sector, in Scotland, has a significant impact upon the economy and comprises central government departments, local government, and public corporations. In quarter 3 of 2005, there were 577,300 people employed in the public sector, which accounts for 23.4% of employment in Scotland - this includes all medical professionals employed within the <a href="/wiki/NHS_Scotland" id="w">National Health Service in Scotland</a>, those employed in the <a href="/wiki/Emergency_service" id="w">emergency services</a> and those employed in the state education and higher education sector<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup>. This is in addition to employees of the government in the civil service and in local government as well as <a href="/wiki/Public_bodies" id="w">public bodies</a> and corporations.</p>
<p>There is a clear separation of responsibility of the powers of both the UK government and the devolved <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Executive" id="w">Scottish Executive</a> in relation to the formulation and execution of national economic policy as it affects <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> - this is set out under Section 5 of the <a href="/wiki/Scotland_Act_1998" id="w">Scotland Act 1998</a>.</p>
<a id="UK_Government" name="UK_Government"></a><h3>UK Government</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/UK_Government" id="w">UK Government</a> along with the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a> retains full control over Scotland&#39;s fiscal environment, in relation to taxation (including tax rates and tax collection) and the overall share of central government expenditure apportioned to <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>, in the form of an annual block grant. It also retains complete responsibility for the operation of the Welfare State, in terms of pensions, unemployment insurance and <a href="/wiki/Child_benefit" id="w">child benefit</a> - as part of the UK-wide Welfare State exercised by the UK <a href="/wiki/Department_for_Work_and_Pensions" id="w">Department for Work and Pensions</a> and <a href="/wiki/HM_Treasury" id="w">HM Treasury</a>.
</p><a id="Scottish_Government" name="Scottish_Government"></a><h3>Scottish Government</h3>
<p>The Scottish Executive has very limited power to raise or lower the rate of <a href="/wiki/Income_tax" id="w">income tax</a> in Scotland by up to 3p in the pound, but has the power to vary <a href="/wiki/Business_rates" id="w">business rates</a> and can regulate the application of local taxes such as the <a href="/wiki/Council_tax" id="w">council tax</a> levied by <a href="/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Scotland" id="w">local authorities</a> in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>. Nevertheless the Scottish Executive has full control over how Scotland&#39;s annual block grant is divided between government departments, such as healthcare and education and on state-owned enterprises, such as <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Water" id="w">Scottish Water</a> and <a href="/wiki/Caledonian_MacBrayne" id="w">Caledonian MacBrayne</a>. The Scottish Executive does however have control over Economic Development policy, and controls, funds and regulates the national Economic development Agency - <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Enterprise" id="w">Scottish Enterprise</a>. In 2006, for example, the budget of the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Executive" id="w">Scottish Executive</a> was around £25bn, <sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> which the Scottish Executive can spend on the areas under its jurisdiction such as education, healthcare, transport, the environment and justice.</p>
<a id="Local" name="Local"></a><h4>Local </h4>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Scotland" id="w">32 unitary authorities in Scotland</a> have the ability to levy a local tax, called the <a href="/wiki/Council_Tax" id="w">Council Tax</a> which is used to pay for local services such as refuse collection, street lighting, roads, pavements, public parks and museums. The value of residential property is the base for the tax, with each dwelling allocated to one of eight bands coded by letters A through H (H being the highest) on the basis of its assumed capital value. Each local authority sets a tax rate expressed as the annual levy on a Band D property inhabited by two liable adults. The budget of local authorities is supplemented by direct <a href="/wiki/Grant_(money)" id="w">grants</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Executive" id="w">Scottish Executive</a>.</p>
<a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h4>Education</h4>

Most universities are linked with a  flourishing research and development sector; the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Dundee" id="w">University of Dundee</a> is at the heart of a <a href="/wiki/Biotechnology" id="w">biotechnology</a> and  <a href="/wiki/Medical" id="w">medical</a> research cluster <sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup>; the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" id="w">University of Edinburgh</a> is a centre of excellence in the field of <a href="/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence" id="w">Artificial Intelligence</a> and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen" id="w">University of Aberdeen</a> is a world-leader in the study of offshore technology in the oil and gas industry  <sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> . Scotland generally has a well-educated population - adult Literacy rates are at over 99%.</p>
<a id="Health" name="Health"></a><h4>Health</h4>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Another major component of central government expenditure in Scotland is on healthcare and healthcare related services. The <a href="/wiki/National_Health_Service" id="w">National Health Service</a> (NHS) is the publicly controlled provider of the majority of healthcare in Scotland, with the NHS being a major employer not only in terms of doctors nurses and other key healthcare workers, but also in terms of administration. The service is administered differently from the rest of the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> and is largely <i>free at the point of use</i> to residents in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>, except for <a href="/wiki/Dentistry" id="w">dental</a> services (where those over 19 must pay) and prescriptions (free to the elderly and subsidised for others). In the short term spending on healthcare in Scotland remains high in response to the nations&#39; poor diet and high instance of <a href="/wiki/Heart_disease" id="w">heart disease</a>. In the medium to long term, the challenges of an ageing population are likely to increase demand for health services and put increasing pressure on the health service in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>.</p>
