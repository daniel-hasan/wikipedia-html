<p>The <b>United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America</b> (<a href="/wiki/UE" id="w">UE</a>) is a <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" id="w">labor union</a> which was one of the first unions to affiliate with the <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations" id="w">Congress of Industrial Organizations</a> in <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a> and grew to more than 400,000 members in the <a href="/wiki/1940s" id="w">1940s</a>. Expelled from the CIO in <a href="/wiki/1950" id="w">1950</a>, it was nearly destroyed by raids from the <a href="/wiki/International_Union_of_Electrical_Workers" id="w">International Union of Electrical Workers</a>, which the CIO sponsored as a rival under the leadership of James Carey, a former president of the UE, and from unions affiliated with the <a href="/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor" id="w">American Federation of Labor</a>. Now representing only 35,000 workers in a variety of industries, it continues actively organizing and has formed a strategic alliance with the <a href="/wiki/Authentic_Labor_Front" id="w">Authentic Labor Front</a>, an independent <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexican</a> union. Today UE is regarded as one of the most democratic and politically progressive national unions in the United States. Their slogan is &#34;The Members Run This Union!&#34;</p>


<a id="Growth_and_schism" name="Growth_and_schism"></a><h1>Growth and schism</h1>
<p>The CIO granted the UE a charter shortly after its formation. The UE expanded greatly in the next decade, winning a contentious strike at <a href="/wiki/RCA_Corporation" id="w">RCA Corporation</a> and expanding throughout Westinghouse and GM. By the end of World War II, UE was the third largest CIO union, with a membership of 500,000.</p>
<p>While the union was growing, international politics became significant for the union&#39;s internal politics. During the <a href="/wiki/Popular_Front" id="w">Popular Front</a> era of the last half of the <a href="/wiki/1930s" id="w">1930s</a>, Socialists, Catholics and Communists in the UE&#39;s leadership put aside many of their differences to work on the common goal of organizing, winning union recognition and negotiating collective bargaining agreements. That unity began to fray later in the decade, particularly at the level of national leadership. The Communist Party&#39;s change in position after the signing of the <a href="/wiki/Molotov-Ribbentrop_pact" id="w">Molotov-Ribbentrop pact</a>, when it began to attack <a href="/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt" id="w">Roosevelt</a>, isolated it within the CIO and caused Carey, who had worked closely with Communist UE officials in the past, to distance himself from them over their opposition to a third term for Roosevelt. </p>
<p>Those differences were papered over, but not resolved, when the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> joined the war against <a href="/wiki/Nazism" id="w">Nazi</a> <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>.The CP-affiliated leadership of the UE joined with other unions in the CIO in urging a no-strike pledge and higher productivity for the duration of the war. The UE also pushed for expanded use of piecework systems in the electrical industry, which it defended as both necessary to boost production and a way to improve workers&#39; earnings under the wartime wage control systems imposed by the War Labor Board. This appears, in fact, to be largely true: the incentive systems that management used were their loosest during World War II and represented an important, and generally popular, form of compensation for workers.</p>
<p>In other ways, however, the UE and other CP-led unions within the CIO went much further than other unions in subordinating their members&#39; short-term interests to the need for defense production. The UE, along with <a href="/wiki/Harry_Bridges" id="w">Harry Bridges</a> of the <a href="/wiki/International_Longshore_and_Warehouse_Union" id="w">International Longshore and Warehouse Union</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Curran" id="w">Joseph Curran</a> of the <a href="/wiki/National_Maritime_Union" id="w">National Maritime Union</a> even supported a proposal by Roosevelt in <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a> to militarize some civilian workplaces, but retreated when the rest of the CIO executive board reacted furiously against it. On the other hand, UE took a more progressive position on women&#39;s rights than many other unions with large numbers of women in its membership, advocating &#34;equal pay for equal work,&#34; and, after the war, resisting employers&#39; attempts to drive married women out of the industry and to deny seniority and maternity leave to women workers. </p>
<p>Those fissures within the UE reopened after the end of World War II and in the first few months of the <a href="/wiki/Cold_war" id="w">Cold war</a>, when the political climate for labor also became chilly. <a href="/wiki/United_States_Republican_Party" id="w">Republican</a> victories in the elections of <a href="/wiki/1946" id="w">1946</a> had brought a much more conservative Congress to Washington, with the determination to curb labor. The employers with whom the UE dealt, who had been relatively liberal in the past, now saw the UE as a force to be reckoned with; the union&#39;s success in shutting down all of GE&#39;s and Westinghouse&#39;s plants in <a href="/wiki/1946" id="w">1946</a> and workers&#39; success in turning incentive pay programs to their own advantage by manipulating production convinced management that it needed to take a tougher line with the union. </p>
<p>At the same time, the issue of Communist influence in the labor movement became even more salient, with the UE being one of the unions most frequently attacked for being Communist-led. Investigations by the <a href="/wiki/House_Unamerican_Activities_Committee" id="w">House Unamerican Activities Committee</a> and criticism from groups such as the <a href="/wiki/Association_of_Catholic_Trade_Unionists" id="w">Association of Catholic Trade Unionists</a> put leftist leaders on the defensive, while encouraging internal opposition to the leadership.</p>
<p>The left leadership continued securely in power, winning reelection over the right wing candidates put forward at its <a href="/wiki/1946" id="w">1946</a> convention, but found itself increasingly estranged from the leadership of the CIO, which had passed funds to right-wing opposition forces within the union through Father <a href="/wiki/Charles_Owen_Rice" id="w">Charles Owen Rice</a>, the head of the ACTU. After passage of the <a href="/wiki/Taft_Hartley_Act" id="w">Taft Hartley Act</a> in <a href="/wiki/1947" id="w">1947</a>, the CIO did nothing to discourage the <a href="/wiki/United_Auto_Workers" id="w">United Auto Workers</a> from raiding UE shops in the arms and typewriter industries in the Connecticut River valley; other unions outside the CIO, such as the <a href="/wiki/International_Brotherhood_of_Electrical_Workers" id="w">International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers</a>, likewise displaced the UE in some plants, aided by the fact that the union could not appear on the ballot in any election conducted by the <a href="/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board" id="w">National Labor Relations Board</a> since it had refused to sign the non-communist affidavits required by the Taft-Hartley Act.</p>
<p>While those raids generally weakened the right opposition&#39;s base of support within the UE, the opposition appeared to be gaining strength by the union&#39;s <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a> convention. The UE leadership therefore demanded that the CIO take action to stop the UAW and other CIO unions from raiding it, then reversed its position on signing non-communist affidavits to permit the UE to fight NLRB decertification elections. When the CIO failed to give it those assurances, the UE boycotted the CIO&#39;s national convention in <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a>; the CIO responded the following year by ejecting the UE and nine other unions.</p>
<p>The CIO went one step farther in the case of the UE, chartering a rival union, the International Union of Electrical Workers. The IUE wrested away many of the locals in the radio assembly and light manufacturing industry; the UE held on to much of its base in machine-building. In the heavy manufacturing plants, on the other hand, the two factions each had substantial strength. The resulting battles were fierce: in Local 601, which represented Westinghouse workers in <a href="/wiki/East_Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a> and whose members had a tradition of radical politics dating back to <a href="/wiki/Eugene_V._Debs" id="w">Eugene V. Debs</a>&#39; candidacy for President in <a href="/wiki/1912" id="w">1912</a>, the two factions were led by brothers Mike and Tom Fitzgerald, who attacked each other personally as vigorously as the factions did on political issues. The IUE won a close election, with the semi-skilled workers supporting the IUE while more skilled workers favored the UE.</p>
<p>While the UE and the IUE won roughly equal number of elections in this period, the IUE came away with larger numbers of members, particularly in the growing field of consumer electronics. Other unions, including the IBEW, the IAW, the UAW, the <a href="/wiki/United_Steel_Workers_of_America" id="w">United Steel Workers of America</a>, the <a href="/wiki/International_Brotherhood_of_Teamsters" id="w">International Brotherhood of Teamsters</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Sheet_Metal_Workers_International_Association" id="w">Sheet Metal Workers International Association</a>, also wedged in during these elections, which continued until <a href="/wiki/1954" id="w">1954</a>. The IUE, moreover, found itself divided, as the divergent groups that had allied to oppose the UE now found it hard to work with each other once in power.</p>
<p>The UE, however, was even more fractured. While the need to repel assaults from all quarters led to a sort of grim solidarity in the early <a href="/wiki/1950s" id="w">1950s</a>, later in the decade important locals that had remained within the UE defected to the IUE. The UE&#39;s membership dropped from 200,000 in <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a> to 58,000 in <a href="/wiki/1960" id="w">1960</a>. The UE&#39;s weakened state made it difficult to resist GE&#39;s and Westinghouse&#39;s demands, particularly as older plants in the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Northeast" id="w">Northeast</a> closed, replaced by new plants in the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Southern_states" id="w">South</a> and <a href="/wiki/U.S._West" id="w">West</a>.</p>
<a id="Reshaping_itself" name="Reshaping_itself"></a><h1>Reshaping itself</h1>
<p>The UE and IUE learned to cooperate in bargaining after the IUE&#39;s disastrous <a href="/wiki/1960" id="w">1960</a> strike against GE. The UE lost many of its members in the industry, however, in the <a href="/wiki/1980s" id="w">1980s</a> and <a href="/wiki/1990s" id="w">1990s</a>, as the flight of many manufacturing plants abroad led to plant closings by both major employers in the electrical manufacturing industry, reducing the UE to its historic base in the machine-building industry.</p>
<p>The UE has since broadened its scope, organizing service industry workers, school and college employees, and others. The UE has also replaced <a href="/wiki/AFL-CIO" id="w">AFL-CIO</a> unions in workplaces where the existing union has failed to satisfy the membership.</p>
<p>The UE has also entered into a Strategic Organizing Alliance with the <i>Frente Auténtico del Trabajo</i> (FAT), Mexico&#39;s Authentic Labor Front, in which the UE and FAT collaborate in organizing and educational projects. The UE has also attempted to form strong alliances with non-labor groups, both at home and internationally through the <a href="/wiki/World_Social_Forum" id="w">World Social Forum</a>, to fight the effects of <a href="/wiki/Globalization" id="w">globalization</a> represented by organizations such as the <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" id="w">International Monetary Fund</a> and programs such as the <a href="/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement" id="w">North American Free Trade Agreement</a>.</p>
<p>UE is becoming even better known as the &#34;National Home for Independent Unions&#34;, and works closely with independent union across the country. The most recent victory for UE came on July 20th, 2005 when the 2300 member Connecticut Independent Labor and Police Unions (CILU/CIPU) voted by an overwhelming 936 to 121 margin to become UE Local 222. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.cilu.org" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cilu.org">http://www.cilu.org</a></p>
