<p><b>The Orb</b> are an <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> <a href="/wiki/Electronic_music" id="w">electronic music</a> group known for popularising <a href="/wiki/Chill_out_music" id="w">chill out music</a> in the 1990s and spawning the genre of <a href="/wiki/Ambient_house" id="w">ambient house</a>.  Founded in 1988 by <a href="/wiki/Alex_Paterson" id="w">Alex Paterson</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_KLF" id="w">KLF</a> member <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Cauty" id="w">Jimmy Cauty</a>, The Orb began as <a href="/wiki/Ambient_music" id="w">ambient</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dub_music" id="w">dub</a> <a href="/wiki/Disc_jockey" id="w">DJs</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>.  Their early performances were inspired by ambient and electronic artists of the 1970s and 1980s, most notably <a href="/wiki/Brian_Eno" id="w">Brian Eno</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kraftwerk" id="w">Kraftwerk</a>.  Because of their &#34;trippy&#34; sound, The Orb developed a cult following among <a href="/wiki/Clubber" id="w">clubbers</a> &#34;coming down&#34; from drug-induced highs.<sup id="_ref-guardian-chills_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardian-chills" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The Orb has maintained their drug-related and science fiction themes despite personnel changes including the departure of Cauty and other Orb members <a href="/wiki/Kris_Weston" id="w">Kris Weston</a>, <a href="/wiki/Simon_Phillips_(producer)" id="w">Simon Phillips</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Andy_Hughes" id="w">Andy Hughes</a>.  Paterson has been the only permanent member, continuing to work as The Orb with the <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Swiss</a>-<a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> producer <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Fehlmann" id="w">Thomas Fehlmann</a>.</p>
<p>Alex Paterson prides The Orb on manipulating obscure samples beyond recognition in their albums and concerts; however, his unauthorised use of other artist&#39;s work has led to disputes with musicians such as <a href="/wiki/Rickie_Lee_Jones" id="w">Rickie Lee Jones</a>.<sup id="_ref-remixmag-orblivion_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-remixmag-orblivion" title="">[2]</a></sup>  During their live shows of the 1990s, The Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and digital media.  Despite changes in their performance method, The Orb have maintained their colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert.  These visually intensive performances prompted many critics to compare The Orb to <a href="/wiki/Pink_Floyd" id="w">Pink Floyd</a>.</p>
<p>The Orb&#39;s critical and commercial success in the UK peaked in the early 1990s with their albums <i><a href="/wiki/The_Orb%26%2339%3Bs_Adventures_Beyond_The_Ultraworld" id="w">The Orb&#39;s Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/U.F.Orb" id="w">U.F.Orb</a></i>, which reached #1 on the <a href="/wiki/UK_Albums_Chart" id="w">UK Albums Chart</a> in 1992.  This success led to their infamous appearance on <i><a href="/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops" id="w">Top of the Pops</a></i>, where they showcased their quirky style by playing chess (an interest of Paterson&#39;s since his early youth) while the group&#39;s single &#34;<a href="/wiki/Blue_Room_(The_Orb)" id="w">Blue Room</a>&#34; ran in the background.  The Orb&#39;s mid-1990s albums were met with mixed reactions from UK critics; however, their work received praise from American publications such as <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" id="w">Rolling Stone</a></i>.  They experimented with vocalists on their next two albums, which critics generally described as bland and uninspired.  The Orb shifted to the minimalist techno style spearheaded by member Thomas Fehlmann, releasing their new material on the record label <a href="/wiki/Kompakt" id="w">Kompakt</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Alex_Paterson" id="w">Alex Paterson</a> began his music career in the early 1980s as a <a href="/wiki/Roadie" id="w">roadie</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Post-punk" id="w">post-punk</a> rock band <a href="/wiki/Killing_Joke" id="w">Killing Joke</a>, for whom his childhood friend <a href="/wiki/Martin_Glover" id="w">Martin &#34;Youth&#34; Glover</a> played bass.<sup id="_ref-Scotsman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Scotsman" title="">[3]</a></sup>  After leaving Killing Joke in 1986, Paterson met future <a href="/wiki/The_KLF" id="w">KLF</a> member <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Cauty" id="w">Jimmy Cauty</a><sup id="_ref-century_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-century" title="">[4]</a></sup> and the duo began DJ-ing and producing music together under the name <i>The Orb</i>.  Paterson and Cauty&#39;s first release was a 1988 <a href="/wiki/Acid_house" id="w">acid house</a> anthem track, &#34;Tripping on Sunshine&#34;, released on the German record compilation <i><a href="/wiki/Eternity_Project_One" id="w">Eternity Project One</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-rough_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rough" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The following year, The Orb released the <i><a href="/wiki/Kiss_EP" id="w">Kiss EP</a></i>, a four-track <a href="/wiki/EP" id="w">EP</a> based on samples from <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/KISS_FM" id="w">KISS FM</a>.<sup id="_ref-rough_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rough" title="">[5]</a></sup>  It was released on Paterson and Glover&#39;s new record label <a href="/wiki/WAU!_Mr._Modo_Records" id="w">WAU! Mr. Modo Records</a>, which Paterson and Glover created out of a desire to maintain financial independence from larger record labels.<sup id="_ref-century_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-century" title="">[4]</a></sup>  After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as &#34;really shit drum sounds&#34;, the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by removing the percussion tracks.<sup id="_ref-keyboard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keyboard" title="">[6]</a></sup>  Paterson and Cauty began DJ-ing in London and landed a deal for The Orb to play the <a href="/wiki/Chill_out_music" id="w">chill out</a> room at London nightclub <a href="/wiki/Heaven_(nightclub)" id="w">Heaven</a>.  Resident DJ <a href="/wiki/Paul_Oakenfold" id="w">Paul Oakenfold</a> brought in the duo specifically as ambient DJs for his &#34;The Land of Oz&#34; event at Heaven.<sup id="_ref-Irish-boyd_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Irish-boyd" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Though The Orb&#39;s Monday night performances had only several &#34;hard-core&#34; followers initially, their &#34;Chill Out Room&#34; act grew popular over the course of their six month stay to the point that the small room was often packed with around 100&#160;people.<sup id="_ref-ocean_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ocean" title="">[8]</a></sup>  The Orb&#39;s performances became most popular among weary DJs and clubbers seeking solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor.<sup id="_ref-amg-bio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amg-bio" title="">[9]</a></sup>  The Orb would build up melodies using <a href="/wiki/Multitrack_recording" id="w">multitrack recordings</a> linked to multiple <a href="/wiki/Record_deck" id="w">record decks</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Mixing_console" id="w">mixer</a>.  They incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop" id="w">BBC sound effects</a> into their act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Sue%C3%B1o_Latino" id="w">Sueño Latino</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ocean_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ocean" title="">[8]</a></sup>  Though they used a variety of samples, they avoided heavy rhythm and drums so as not to disrupt their intended ambient atmosphere.

<p>Throughout 1989, The Orb, along with Martin Glover, developed the musical genre of <a href="/wiki/Ambient_house" id="w">ambient house</a> through the use of a diverse array of <a href="/wiki/Sampling_(music)" id="w">samples</a> and recordings.  The culmination of their musical work came towards the end of the year when The Orb recorded a session for <a href="/wiki/John_Peel" id="w">John Peel</a> on <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radio_1" id="w">BBC Radio 1</a>.  The track, then known as &#34;Loving You&#34;, was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a> radio plays, nature sounds, and <a href="/wiki/Minnie_Riperton" id="w">Minnie Riperton</a>&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/Lovin%26%2339%3B_You_(Minnie_Riperton_song)" id="w">Lovin&#39; You</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-amg-peel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amg-peel" title="">[11]</a></sup>  For its release as a single on record label <a href="/wiki/Big_Life" id="w">Big Life</a>, The Orb changed the title to &#34;<a href="/wiki/A_Huge_Ever_Growing_Pulsating_Brain_That_Rules_from_the_Centre_of_the_Ultraworld" id="w">A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld</a>&#34;.  Upon the single&#39;s release, Riperton&#39;s management forced Big Life to remove the unlicensed Riperton sample, ensuring that only the initial first-week release of the single contained the original vocals of Minnie Riperton; subsequent pressings used vocals from a sound-alike.<sup id="_ref-Irish-boyd_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Irish-boyd" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Despite its running time of 22 minutes, the sample-laden single reached #78 on the <a href="/wiki/UK_singles_chart" id="w">UK singles chart</a>.  Soon thereafter, The Orb was commissioned by <a href="/wiki/David_A._Stewart" id="w">Dave Stewart</a> to remix his top 20 single &#34;<a href="/wiki/Lily_Was_Here" id="w">Lily Was Here</a>&#34;.  The Orb obliged and was soon offered several more remix jobs from artists including <a href="/wiki/Erasure" id="w">Erasure</a> and <a href="/wiki/System_7_(band)" id="w">System 7</a>.  </p>
<p>In 1990, Paterson and Cauty held several recording sessions at Cauty&#39;s studio, <a href="/wiki/Trancentral" id="w">Trancentral</a>.  When offered an album deal by Big Life, The Orb found themselves at a crossroads: Cauty preferred that The Orb release their music through his <a href="/wiki/KLF_Communications" id="w">KLF Communications</a> label, whereas Paterson wanted to ensure that The Orb did not become a side-project of The KLF.<sup id="_ref-times-waves_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-times-waves" title="">[12]</a></sup>  Due to these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name <i>The Orb</i>.<sup id="_ref-amg-bio_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amg-bio" title="">[9]</a></sup>  As a result of the break-up, Cauty removed Paterson&#39;s contributions from the in-progress recordings and released the album as <i><a href="/wiki/Space_(album)" id="w">Space</a></i> on KLF Communications.<sup id="_ref-klfcomm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-klfcomm" title="">[13]</a></sup> Also out of these sessions came <a href="/wiki/The_KLF" id="w">The KLF</a> album <i><a href="/wiki/Chill_Out" id="w">Chill Out</a></i>, on which Paterson appeared in an uncredited role.<sup id="_ref-generation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-generation" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-century_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-century" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following the split, Paterson began working with Youth on the track &#34;<a href="/wiki/Little_Fluffy_Clouds" id="w">Little Fluffy Clouds</a>&#34;.  They incorporated samples from <a href="/wiki/Steve_Reich" id="w">Steve Reich</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Electric_Counterpoint" id="w">Electric Counterpoint</a></i> and vocal clips from an interview with <a href="/wiki/Rickie_Lee_Jones" id="w">Rickie Lee Jones</a> in which she recalls picturesque images from her childhood.<sup id="_ref-slant_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-slant" title="">[15]</a></sup>  While Reich was flattered by The Orb&#39;s use of his work,<sup id="_ref-reich-bn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reich-bn" title="">[16]</a></sup> Jones pursued the issue in the legal system.<sup id="_ref-amg-bio_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amg-bio" title="">[9]</a></sup>  Big Life chose to <a href="/wiki/Settlement_(law)" id="w">settle</a> out of court for an undisclosed sum of money for use of her voice on The Orb&#39;s recording.<sup id="_ref-amg-bio_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amg-bio" title="">[9]</a></sup>  &#34;Little Fluffy Clouds&#34; reached #87 on the UK singles chart; however, due to Glover&#39;s other production obligations, he did not become a permanent member of The Orb.<sup id="_ref-amg-bio_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amg-bio" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>In late 1991 and early 1992, Paterson and Weston wrote their next single, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Blue_Room_(single)" id="w">Blue Room</a>&#34;.

Paterson, Hughes, and Fehlmann then finished producing the album <i><a href="/wiki/Orbus_Terrarum" id="w">Orbus Terrarum</a></i>, on which Paterson and Weston had been working. <i>Orbus Terrarum</i>, released in 1995, featured more &#34;earthbound&#34; and &#34;organic&#34; sounds than their previous trippy science fiction themed music.<sup id="_ref-keyboard_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keyboard" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-independent-terra_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-independent-terra" title="">[29]</a></sup>  <i>Orbus Terrarum</i> suffered, as Paterson described it, &#34;a good kicking&#34; at the hands of the British press,<sup id="_ref-future-98_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-future-98" title="">[30]</a></sup> who described it as &#34;generic&#34; and a low point for Paterson&#39;s creativity.<sup id="_ref-times-orbus_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-times-orbus" title="">[31]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-guardian-simpson_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardian-simpson" title="">[27]</a></sup>  <i>Orbus Terrarum</i> alienated many of the group&#39;s fans,<sup id="_ref-rs-orblivion_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rs-orblivion" title="">[32]</a></sup> causing the album to only reach #20 on the UK charts.<sup id="_ref-everyhit_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-everyhit" title="">[33]</a></sup>  American critics, however, gave it great acclaim including <i>Rolling Stone</i> who made it their album of the month, citing the album&#39;s symphonic flow coupled with The Orb&#39;s &#34;uniquely British wit&#34;.<sup id="_ref-rs-orbus_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rs-orbus" title="">[34]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-amg-orbus_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amg-orbus" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-century_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-century" title="">[4]</a></sup> After a long world tour, The Orb, with Andy Hughes and Steve Hillage, settled down to produce their next album, <i><a href="/wiki/Orblivion" id="w">Orblivion</a></i>—the process of which saw a return to their spacy sounds.

Imagery has always been an important part of The Orb&#39;s persona.<sup id="_ref-toop-live_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-toop-live" title="">[73]</a></sup>  This is most prominent during live performances, where The Orb often projects surreal images against onstage screens.  Common images include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and ubiquitous alien references.<sup id="_ref-rollingstone-live97_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rollingstone-live97" title="">[74]</a></sup>  They have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs.<sup id="_ref-birmingham-guru_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-birmingham-guru" title="">[70]</a></sup>  This has carried over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins.  Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, The Orb&#39;s shows are frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also experimented with in-show imagery and films.<sup id="_ref-rollingstone-live97_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rollingstone-live97" title="">[74]</a></sup>  Paterson cites <a href="/wiki/Godfrey_Reggio" id="w">Godfrey Reggio</a>&#39;s and <a href="/wiki/Philip_Glass" id="w">Philip Glass</a>&#39;s film <a href="/wiki/Koyaanisqatsi" id="w">Koyaanisqatsi</a> as a primary influence to their concert imagery.<sup id="_ref-option-97_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-option-97" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>

Noted graphic design group <a href="/wiki/The_Designers_Republic" id="w">The Designers Republic</a> created the cover art for The Orb&#39;s earlier work, including <i>Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld</i>, <i>U.F.Orb</i>, and the singles from those two albums.<sup id="_ref-backside_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-backside" title="">[75]</a></sup>  For their next album, The Orb poked fun at their Pink Floyd comparisons with the cover of <i>Live 93</i> featuring a floating stuffed sheep over the <a href="/wiki/Battersea_Power_Station" id="w">Battersea Power Station</a>, which had appeared on the cover of Pink Floyd&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Animals_(album)" id="w">Animals</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-JAM_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JAM" title="">[76]</a></sup>  The artwork found in Badorb.com releases was similar to The Orb&#39;s odd artwork of the mid-1990s, as it was stylistically similar and contained little writing.<sup id="_ref-citypaper_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-citypaper" title="">[25]</a></sup>  Paterson has also dabbled in the creation of cover art himself, designing the cover of <i>Okie Dokie It&#39;s The Orb on Kompakt</i>.<sup id="_ref-discogs-okie_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-discogs-okie" title="">[77]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Science_fiction_and_space" name="Science_fiction_and_space"></a><h3>Science fiction and space</h3>
<p>Some of the more prominent motifs in The Orb&#39;s work are outer space and science fiction, including alien visitations, <a href="/wiki/Space_flight" id="w">space flight</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mind_control" id="w">mind control</a>.  These have included The Orb&#39;s use of samples from serious sources such as <a href="/wiki/NASA" id="w">NASA</a> transmissions to comedic clips from films like <a href="/wiki/Woody_Allen" id="w">Woody Allen</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Sleeper_(film)" id="w">Sleeper</a></i>.  <i>U.F.Orb</i> especially expressed a fascination with alien life with its bizarre sound samples and in the album&#39;s title itself.<sup id="_ref-phoenix_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-phoenix" title="">[20]</a></sup>  The title of its most popular single, &#34;Blue Room&#34;, is itself a reference to the supposed Blue Room of <a href="/wiki/Wright-Patterson_Air_Force_Base" id="w">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a>, which was heavily investigated as a possible UFO evidence holding room.<sup id="_ref-times-hippie_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-times-hippie" title="">[69]</a></sup>  Their 2001 album, too, is named for a space-related subject, specifically the <a href="/wiki/Cydonia_Mensae" id="w">Cydonia Mensae</a> region of Mars.<sup id="_ref-remixmag-orblivion_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-remixmag-orblivion" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Due to Paterson&#39;s focus on science fiction and astronomical phenomena, <i>The Guardian</i> described Paterson as &#34;pop [music]&#39;s primary spokesperson on aliens&#34;.<sup id="_ref-guardian-simpson_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardian-simpson" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

In The Orb&#39;s early DJ events in the 1980s, Paterson and Cauty performed with three record decks, a cassette player, and a CD player all of which were mixed through an <a href="/wiki/Akai" id="w">Akai</a> 12-track <a href="/wiki/Mixing_console" id="w">mixer</a>.<sup id="_ref-shih_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shih" title="">[36]</a></sup>  They used their equipment to harmonise recorded music and sound effect samples into an &#34;endless sound continuum&#34; for audiences of worn out dancers.<sup id="_ref-century_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-century" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Even after The Orb began producing original material, they kept the same sample-heavy model for live acts by spontaneously integrating obscure samples into their pre-recorded tracks.  During promotional tours for <i>Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld</i> and <i>U.F.Orb</i>, The Orb performed using a <a href="/wiki/Digital_audio_tape" id="w">digital audio tape</a> machine and experimented with other media sources such as <a href="/wiki/Dubplate" id="w">dubplates</a>.  The tape machines held individual chords, rhythms, and basslines for each composition, allowing The Orb to reprocess them and mimic the act of DJ-ing.<sup id="_ref-tandt_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tandt" title="">[24]</a></sup>  Members could then easily improvise with these samples and manipulate them using sound effect <a href="/wiki/Amp_rack" id="w">racks</a>.<sup id="_ref-keyboard_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keyboard" title="">[6]</a></sup>  Often, The Orb had a live musician accompanying them, such as Steve Hillage on guitar.  Their shows in the early 1990s would often be three hours of semi-improvised, continuous music featuring a wealth of triggered samples, voices, and pre-recorded tracks which were barely identifiable as the original piece.<sup id="_ref-times-anything_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-times-anything" title="">[78]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-times-anything_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-times-anything" title="">[78]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The Orb began performing regularly at the <a href="/wiki/Brixton_Academy" id="w">Brixton Academy</a> in the early 1990s, where they used the high ceilings and large space for their &#34;well-suited amorphous sound&#34;, frequently performing their newest and more experimental pieces there.<sup id="_ref-guardian-performance97_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardian-performance97" title="">[79]</a></sup> Andy Hughes took Weston&#39;s place at live performances after the 1993 tour, though Weston did reappear for The Orb&#39;s concert at the rainy <a href="/wiki/Woodstock_%26%2339%3B94" id="w">Woodstock &#39;94</a>.<sup id="_ref-amg-bio_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amg-bio" title="">[9]</a></sup>  The Orb played for late night raves on the first two nights of Woodstock &#39;94 in addition to artists including <a href="/wiki/Aphex_Twin" id="w">Aphex Twin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Orbital" id="w">Orbital</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Deee-Lite" id="w">Deee-Lite</a>.  The next year, The Orb&#39;s touring group consisted of Paterson, Hughes, Nick Burton on percussion, and Simon Phillips on bass.  This ensemble of live performers and electronic music created a &#34;cacophony&#34; of &#34;gigantic, swarming sounds&#34;.<sup id="_ref-times-something_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-times-something" title="">[80]</a></sup>  Though The Orb&#39;s performances use much onstage equipment and many props, Paterson prefers to present The Orb as &#34;a non-centralised figure of amusement on stage&#34;.<sup id="_ref-independent-earth_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-independent-earth" title="">[28]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The Orb used <a href="/wiki/ADAT" id="w">ADAT</a> recorders for performances from 1993 to 2001 and utilised large 48-track decks, which Paterson described as basically being a &#34;studio onstage&#34;.<sup id="_ref-remix_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-remix" title="">[81]</a></sup>  They hooked synthesisers, such as the <a href="/wiki/ARP_2600" id="w">ARP 2600</a>, to <a href="/wiki/MIDI" id="w">MIDI</a> interfaces to recreate specific sounds that appeared on their albums.<sup id="_ref-keyboard_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keyboard" title="">[6]</a></sup>  The Orb&#39;s methods of studio music creation changed as well.  For more recent albums such as <i>Cydonia</i>, The Orb used inexpensive equipment such as <a href="/wiki/Korg" id="w">Korg</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Electribe" id="w">Electribe</a> products, which Paterson described as employing more of a &#34;bedroom techno&#34; approach.<sup id="_ref-remixmag-orblivion_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-remixmag-orblivion" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Despite their use of laptops during performances and in-studio computers, Paterson says that he still cherishes vinyl and does not find purchasing CDs or downloading music to be nearly as satisfying.<sup id="_ref-guardian-interview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardian-interview" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Sampling_and_remixing" name="Sampling_and_remixing"></a><h3>Sampling and remixing</h3>
<p>One of The Orb&#39;s most notable contributions to electronic music is their idea of blurring the distinction between sampling and remixing.<sup id="_ref-tandt_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tandt" title="">[24]</a></sup> Albums such as <i>Pomme Fritz</i>, though released as a piece of original work, consist largely of manipulated samples.  Conversely, The Orb&#39;s remixes typically use only small sections of the original track, most notably in the case of their single &#34;Toxygene&#34;.  &#34;Toxygene&#34; was originally commissioned as a remix of <a href="/wiki/Jean_Michel_Jarre" id="w">Jean Michel Jarre</a>&#39;s &#34;Oxygene 8&#34; from <i><a href="/wiki/Oxygene_7-13" id="w">Oxygene 7-13</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-spheres_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spheres" title="">[82]</a></sup>  However, The Orb &#34;obliterated it&#34; and reassembled only a few fragments for their remix, much to the chagrin of Jarre, who reportedly refused to release it;<sup id="_ref-spheres_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spheres" title="">[82]</a></sup>  The Orb released the track themselves under the name &#34;Toxygene&#34;, which further irritated Jarre, to whom Paterson retorted &#34;The French are always five years behind us, anyway.&#34;<sup id="_ref-spheres_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spheres" title="">[82]</a></sup>  In statements made after the release of &#34;Toxygene&#34;, however, Jarre denied that he rejected the original remix because of disliking it.<sup id="_ref-dotmusic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dotmusic" title="">[83]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other artists have gotten agitated with The Orb sampling their work, though Paterson jokingly suggests that &#34;[t]hey don&#39;t know the half of it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-citypaper_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-citypaper" title="">[25]</a></sup>  Paterson says that he finds a &#34;beauty&#34; and a &#34;cleverness&#34; with slipping unlicensed samples into compositions without anyone recognizing it.<sup id="_ref-keyboard_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keyboard" title="">[6]</a></sup>  Even though fans often try to guess the origins of many of The Orb&#39;s samples, Paterson states that they are rarely correct and that they would &#34;die&#34; if they discovered, for example, where the drums on &#34;Little Fluffy Clouds&#34; originated from.<sup id="_ref-remixmag-orblivion_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-remixmag-orblivion" title="">[2]</a></sup>  He has said that record labels have cautioned him, &#34;Don&#39;t tell anyone where you got your samples until we get them cleared!&#34;.<sup id="_ref-remixmag-orblivion_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-remixmag-orblivion" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Orb has used a wide variety of audio clips from sources ranging from <a href="/wiki/McCarthy_era" id="w">McCarthy era</a> speeches to prank phone calls by <a href="/wiki/Victor_Lewis-Smith" id="w">Victor Lewis-Smith</a> to <a href="/wiki/David_Thewlis" id="w">David Thewlis</a>&#39; apocalypse-driven rant from the film <i><a href="/wiki/Naked_(film)" id="w">Naked</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-rollingstone-live97_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rollingstone-live97" title="">[74]</a></sup>  Paterson obtains many samples from recording TV and radio for hours at a time and picking out his favorite clips.<sup id="_ref-keyboard_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keyboard" title="">[6]</a></sup>  He and other members of The Orb record nature sounds for use on albums, most notably on <i>FFWD</i> and <i>Orbus Terrarum</i>.  The Orb&#39;s combination of ambient music and sampling from lower fidelity audio sources often creates a &#34;fuzzy texture&#34; in the sound quality, depersonalising The Orb&#39;s music.<sup id="_ref-tandt_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tandt" title="">[24]</a></sup>  The Orb is lauded for their &#34;Monty Python-esque levity&#34; in their use of audio samples,<sup id="_ref-rs-orblivion_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rs-orblivion" title="">[32]</a></sup> though <i>NME</i> asserts that Paterson &#34;sabotage[s] his majestic soundscapes&#34; with &#34;irritatingly zany&#34; sounds.<sup id="_ref-nme-aubrey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nme-aubrey" title="">[84]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The Orb has been a prolific remixing team, having completed over 80 commissioned remixes since 1989.<sup id="_ref-backside_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-backside" title="">[75]</a></sup>  Even during periods of label conflict and contractual limbo, The Orb found steady work remixing for artists including <a href="/wiki/Depeche_Mode" id="w">Depeche Mode</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lisa_Stansfield" id="w">Lisa Stansfield</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Front_242" id="w">Front 242</a>.  Though The Orb&#39;s remixes from the early and mid-1990s feature a large number of comical samples, <i><a href="/wiki/Progressive-Sounds" id="w">Progressive-Sounds</a></i> describe them as &#34;ahead of their time&#34; and <i>NME</i> notes them as &#34;not entirely incompatible with contemporary chilling.&#34;<sup id="_ref-ps-aubrey_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ps-aubrey" title="">[64]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-nme-aubrey_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nme-aubrey" title="">[84]</a></sup>  However, some pieces, such as their <a href="/wiki/Bee_Gees" id="w">Bee Gees</a> cover collaboration with <a href="/wiki/Robbie_Williams" id="w">Robbie Williams</a>, received criticism for being &#34;beyond a joke&#34; for their use of strange noises.<sup id="_ref-nme-aubrey_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nme-aubrey" title="">[84]</a></sup>  The Orb&#39;s remix of <a href="/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails" id="w">Nine Inch Nails</a>&#39; &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Perfect_Drug" id="w">The Perfect Drug</a>&#34;, too, was described as &#34;silly&#34;, as they made it sound like <a href="/wiki/Trent_Reznor" id="w">Trent Reznor</a> was &#34;drowning in his bathtub&#34;.<sup id="_ref-amazon-nin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amazon-nin" title="">[85]</a></sup>  Though Paterson maintains that much of The Orb&#39;s remix work is done to support other artists, he admits some of their remixes for major artists were performed so that The Orb could &#34;pay the bills&#34;.<sup id="_ref-birmingham-guru_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-birmingham-guru" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
