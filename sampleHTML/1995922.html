<div class="thumbcaption">A war loan poster captioned &#39;Save for the brave. Let us avenge the Nurses&#39; displayed at an Australian Army workshop in Lae, New Guinea in September 1944.</div>
The attack was universally condemned by Australian servicemen.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins282_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins282" title="">[81]</a></sup> It was commonly believed that the attack on <i>Centaur</i> had been carried out deliberately and in full knowledge of her status.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins282_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins282" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>
<p>Six days after the attack on <i>Centaur</i>, a request was made by the Australian Department of Defence that the identification markings and lights be removed from <a href="/wiki/AHS_Manunda" id="w">Australian hospital ship &#39;&#39;Manunda&#39;&#39;</a>, weapons be installed, and that she begin to sail blacked out and under escort.<sup id="_ref-Mill189-92_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mill189-92" title="">[82]</a></sup> The conversion was performed, although efforts by the Department of the Navy, the Admiralty, and authorities in <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" id="w">United States of America</a> caused the completed conversion to be undone.<sup id="_ref-Mill189-92_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mill189-92" title="">[82]</a></sup> The cost of the roundabout work came to £12,500, and left <i>Manunda</i> out of service for three months.<sup id="_ref-Mill192_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mill192" title="">[83]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/9_June" id="w">9 June</a>, <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a>, communications between the <a href="/wiki/Combined_Chiefs_of_Staff" id="w">Combined Chiefs of Staff</a> on the subject of hospital ships contained a section referring to this incident, with the conclusion that the attack on <i>Centaur</i> was the work of an irresponsible commander, and that it would be better to wait until further Japanese attacks had been made before considering the removal of hospital ship markings.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p>When the consideration was made that the ambulance drivers&#39; weapons incident just prior to Centaur&#39;s voyage may have been partially responsible for the attack, it led to the tightening of rules regarding who was allowed to travel on a hospital ship.<sup id="_ref-Good195_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Good195" title="">[42]</a></sup> Some quasi-medical staff, including <a href="/wiki/Repatriation" id="w">repatriation</a> teams, were no longer permitted aboard hospital ships.<sup id="_ref-Good195_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Good195" title="">[42]</a></sup> Ambulance drivers who were part of the regular Army instead of the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Army_Medical_Corps" id="w">Australian Army Medical Corps</a> had to be transferred before they would be allowed aboard, although they were still permitted to carry their unloaded weapons and ammunition.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Official_protests" name="Official_protests"></a><h3>Official protests</h3>
<p>After consultation with the Australian armed forces, General <a href="/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur" id="w">MacArthur</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Admiralty" id="w">Admiralty</a> and the Australian Government, an official protest was sent to the Japanese, which passed its way through diplomatic channels and was received by the Japanese Government on <a href="/wiki/29_May" id="w">29 May</a>, <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a>.<sup id="_ref-Mill187_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mill187" title="">[12]</a></sup> At around the same time, the <a href="/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross" id="w">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> sent a protest on behalf of the main <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" id="w">Allied</a> Red Cross organisations to the Japanese Red Cross.<sup id="_ref-Mill187_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mill187" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/26_December" id="w">26 December</a>, <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a>, a response to the Australian protest arrived.<sup id="_ref-Mill192_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mill192" title="">[83]</a></sup> It stated that the Japanese Government had no information justifying the allegation made, and therefore took no responsibility for what happened.<sup id="_ref-Mill192_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mill192" title="">[83]</a></sup> The reply then counter-protested that nine Japanese hospital ships had been attacked by the Allies, although these claims were directed against the United States, not Australia.<sup id="_ref-Good195_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Good195" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Mill192_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mill192" title="">[83]</a></sup> Although several later exchanges were made, without any progress, the British informed the Australian Prime Minister on <a href="/wiki/14_November" id="w">14 November</a> that no further communications would be made on the loss of <i>Centaur</i>.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Reasons_for_attack" name="Reasons_for_attack"></a><h2>Reasons for attack</h2>
<p>The attack on <i>Centaur</i> was not an isolated incident. Between June 1942 and December 1944, a total of 27 Japanese submarines <a href="/wiki/Axis_naval_activity_in_Australian_waters" id="w">operated in Australian waters</a>.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins286_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins286" title="">[87]</a></sup> These submarines attacked almost 50 merchant vessels, with 20 sinkings confirmed to be the result of a Japanese attack, and an additional 9 unconfirmed.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins286_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins286" title="">[87]</a></sup> This formed part of a concentrated Japanese effort to destroy supply convoys travelling between Australia and New Guinea.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several actions on <i>Centaur</i>&#39;s part may have contributed to her demise.
<i>Centaur</i> was under orders to sail well out to sea until reaching the <a href="/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" id="w">Great Barrier Reef</a>, with positions between 50 and {{convert}} from the coast given.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup> Upon consideration, and with the belief that they had been given a route intended for a merchant vessel, <i>Centaur<b>s Master ordered the course be changed to one much closer to land, staying on the seaward side of 2,000 metres in depth.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup> Also, <i>Centaur</i> was sailing completely illuminated, with the exception of the two bow floodlights.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins278_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins278" title="">[38]</a></sup> They had been switched off as they interfered with visibility from the bridge.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins278_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins278" title="">[38]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>There are three main theories as to why <i>Centaur</i> was attacked:</p>
<a id="''Centaur''_in_breach" name="''Centaur''_in_breach"></a><h3>&#39;&#39;Centaur&#39;&#39; in breach</h3>
<p>This theory stems from the various rumours spreading after <i>Centaur</i>&#39;s sinking. If <i>Centaur</i> had been in breach of the <a href="/wiki/Hague_Convention_of_1907" id="w">Hague Convention of 1907</a>, and someone had informed the Japanese of this, <i>I-177</i> may have been under orders to attack.<sup id="_ref-Mill232_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mill232" title="">[15]</a></sup> When <i>Centaur</i> left Sydney, her decks were packed with green-uniformed men, and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration of the cloth band ringing the hat, a distant observer could conclude that the outbound hospital ship was carrying soldiers.<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup> Another consideration was that observers of the loading in Sydney would have seen the ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard and come to a similar conclusion.<sup id="_ref-Mill76-7_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mill76-7" title="">[43]</a></sup> If a spy or informant had transmitted that information to the Japanese, <i>I-177</i> could have been lying in wait.<sup id="_ref-Mill232_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mill232" title="">[15]</a></sup> The main flaw in this theory is the question of how Nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that <i>Centaur</i> was taking an alternate route and how they were able to determine the new route selected.<sup id="_ref-Mill233_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mill233" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>
<p>Similar but later rumours included that during her first voyage, <i>Centaur</i> had transported soldiers to New Guinea, or Japanese <a href="/wiki/Prisoners_of_war" id="w">prisoners of war</a> back to Australia for interrogation, and as such was marked as a legitimate target by the Japanese.<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup> <i>Centaur</i> had carried 10 prisoners of war on her return voyage from New Guinea, but they were wounded.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Nakagawa_unaware" name="Nakagawa_unaware"></a><h3>Nakagawa unaware</h3>
<p>This theory states that Nakagawa was unaware that the vessel he was attacking was a hospital ship, and that the sinking was an &#39;unfortunate accident&#39;.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins280_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins280" title="">[95]</a></sup> This view was supported by several Japanese officers, both before and after the revelation that Nakagawa was responsible.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins280_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins280" title="">[95]</a></sup> Amongst them was Lieutenant Commander Zenji Orita, who took command of <i>I-177</i> after Nakagawa.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins280_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins280" title="">[95]</a></sup> Orita did not hear anything from the crew about having sunk a hospital ship, not even rumours, and later claimed that if <i>I-177</i> had knowingly attacked <i>Centaur</i>, he would have heard something.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins280_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins280" title="">[95]</a></sup></p>
<p>When compared to the other contemporary <a href="/wiki/List_of_Australian_Hospital_Ships" id="w">Australian hospital ships</a>, <i>Centaur</i> was by far the smallest, slightly more than a third of the size of <a href="/wiki/AHS_Manunda" id="w">&#39;&#39;Manunda&#39;&#39;</a> or <a href="/wiki/AHS_Wanganella" id="w">&#39;&#39;Wanganella&#39;&#39;</a>.<sup id="_ref-Smith19_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Smith19" title="">[22]</a></sup> <i>Centaur</i> was also slightly shorter in length than <i>I-177</i>.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins282_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins282" title="">[81]</a></sup> The observation of <i>Centaur</i> was made through a <a href="/wiki/Periscope" id="w">periscope</a>, and some submarine officers attest that at 1,500 metres, the optimum range of attack for World War II Japanese submarines, some officers would not be able to identify the target ship&#39;s class or <a href="/wiki/Pennant_number" id="w">pennant number</a>.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins283_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins283" title="">[96]</a></sup> With <i>Centaur<b>s bow floodlights out, and with the observation of the target made through the periscope, there is a possibility Nakagawa would not have seen the hospital ship&#39;s markings if he had been in &#39;the right position&#39;.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins283_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins283" title="">[96]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>However, apart from the two bow floodlights, <i>Centaur</i> was lit up brilliantly.<sup id="_ref-Mill233_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mill233" title="">[92]</a></sup> To attack, <i>I-177</i> would have had to approach from <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Abeam">abeam</a> of <i>Centaur</i>, with the latter illuminated by both its own lights and a full moon.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins283_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins283" title="">[96]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Nakagawa_aware" name="Nakagawa_aware"></a><h3>Nakagawa aware</h3>
<p>This theory states that Nakagawa was fully aware that his target was a hospital ship and, on either his own initiative or his poor interpretation of his orders, decided to sink her regardless.<sup id="_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#_note-97" title="">[97]</a></sup> Why he may have chosen to do so is a question he refused to respond to on multiple occasions, even to defend himself or deny the accusation.<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup> Researchers speculate that as Nakagawa was approaching the end of his tour in Australian waters, and had only sunk a single enemy vessel, the 8,742&#160;ton freighter <i>Limerick</i>, he did not want to return with the disgrace of a single kill.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins278_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins278" title="">[38]</a></sup> His orders to machinegun the survivors of three destroyed British merchant vessels showed that he was willing to ignore the <a href="/wiki/Laws_of_war" id="w">laws of war</a>.<sup id="_ref-Jenkins284_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jenkins284" title="">[68]</a></sup> Nakagawa may have been acting in vengeance for <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" id="w">Allied</a> atrocities during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bismarck_Sea" id="w">Battle of the Bismarck Sea</a>, or may have expected praise for the sinking of an enemy naval vessel.<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup> Nakagawa&#39;s refusal to speak on the subject, coupled with his 1991 death, mean this question can never be answered.</p>
<a id="Shipwreck" name="Shipwreck"></a><h2>Shipwreck</h2>
<p>Following <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, several cursory searches of the waters around <a href="/wiki/North_Stradbroke_Island" id="w">North Stradbroke Island</a> and <a href="/wiki/Moreton_Island" id="w">Moreton Island</a> failed to reveal <i>Centaur</i>&#39;s location.

In 1995, it was announced that the shipwreck of <i>Centaur</i> had been located in waters nine nautical miles (17 km) from the lighthouse on <a href="/wiki/Moreton_Island" id="w">Moreton Island</a>, a significant distance from her believed last position.<sup id="_ref-60mins18-5-03_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60mins18-5-03" title="">[100]</a></sup> The finding was reported on <i><a href="/wiki/A_Current_Affair" id="w">A Current Affair</a></i>, during which film of the shipwreck 170 metres underwater was shown.<sup id="_ref-60mins18-5-03_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60mins18-5-03" title="">[100]</a></sup> Discoverer Donald Dennis claimed the identity of the shipwreck had been confirmed by the Navy, the <a href="/wiki/Queensland_Maritime_Museum" id="w">Queensland Maritime Museum</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" id="w">Australian War Memorial</a>.<sup id="_ref-60mins18-5-03_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60mins18-5-03" title="">[100]</a></sup> A cursory search by the Navy confirmed that there was a ship at the given location, which was <a href="/wiki/Gazetted" id="w">gazetted</a> as a <a href="/wiki/War_grave" id="w">war grave</a> and added to navigation charts by the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Hydrographic_Office" id="w">Australian Hydrographic Office</a>.<sup id="_ref-DOD29-6-03_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DOD29-6-03" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-60mins18-5-03_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60mins18-5-03" title="">[100]</a></sup></p>
<p>Over the next eight years, there was growing doubt about the position of Dennis&#39; wreck, due to the distance from Second Officer Rippon&#39;s calculation of the point of sinking, and where USS <i>Mugford</i> picked up the survivors.<sup id="_ref-Wil24_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wil24" title="">[101]</a></sup> Dennis had been convicted on two counts of deception and one of theft through scams.<sup id="_ref-Wil24_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wil24" title="">[101]</a></sup> Two <a href="/wiki/Wreck_diver" id="w">wreck divers</a> used the location for an eight hour world record dive, during which examined the wreck and took photographs, claiming it to be too small to be <i>Centaur</i>.<sup id="_ref-60mins18-5-03_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60mins18-5-03" title="">[100]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Wil24_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wil24" title="">[101]</a></sup></p>
