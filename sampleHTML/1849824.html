<b><i>Myxobolus cerebralis</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/Myxosporea" id="w">myxosporean</a> <a href="/wiki/Parasite" id="w">parasite</a> of <a href="/wiki/Salmonidae" id="w">salmonids</a> (<a href="/wiki/Salmon" id="w">salmon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trout" id="w">trout</a>, and their allies) that causes <b>whirling disease</b> in <a href="/wiki/Fish_farming" id="w">farmed</a> salmon and trout and also in <a href="/wiki/Fish_stocks" id="w">wild fish populations</a>. It was first described from <a href="/wiki/Rainbow_trout" id="w">rainbow trout</a> in <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> a century ago, but its range has spread and it has appeared in most of <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> (including <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a>), the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a><sup id="_ref-Barth_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barth" title="">[1]</a></sup> and other countries.  In the 1980s, it was discovered that <i>M. cerebralis</i> needs to infect a <a href="/wiki/Tubificidae" id="w">tubificid</a> <a href="/wiki/Oligochaete" id="w">oligochaete</a> (a kind of <a href="/wiki/Segmented_worm" id="w">segmented worm</a>) to complete its life-cycle.<sup id="_ref-Markiw_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Markiw" title="">[2]</a></sup>  The parasite infects its hosts with its cells after piercing them with <a href="/wiki/Polar_filament" id="w">polar filaments</a> ejected from <a href="/wiki/Nematocyst" id="w">nematocyst</a>-like capsules.</p>
<p>Whirling disease afflicts juvenile fish (fingerlings and fry) and causes <a href="/wiki/Skeleton" id="w">skeletal</a> deformation and <a href="/wiki/Neural" id="w">neurological</a> damage. Fish &#34;whirl&#34; forward in an awkward corkscrew-like pattern instead of swimming normally, find feeding difficult, and are more vulnerable to <a href="/wiki/Predator" id="w">predators</a>. The mortality rate is high for fingerlings, up to 90% of infected populations, and those that do survive are deformed by the parasite residing in their <a href="/wiki/Cartilage" id="w">cartilage</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bone" id="w">bone</a>. They act as a reservoir for the parasite, which is released into water following the fish&#39;s death. <i>M. cerebralis</i> is one of the most economically important myxozoans in fish as well as one of the most pathogenic. It was the first myxosporean whose pathology and symptoms were described scientifically.<sup id="_ref-Gilbert_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilbert" title="">[3]</a></sup> The parasite is not transmissible to humans.</p>
<a id="Taxonomy" name="Taxonomy"></a><h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Taxonomy" id="w">taxonomy</a> and naming of both <i>M. cerebralis</i> and of myxozoans in general have complicated histories.  It was originally thought that this parasite infected fish brains (hence the <a href="/wiki/Specific_epithet" id="w">specific epithet</a> <i>cerebralis</i>), however it quickly became apparent that while it can be found in the <a href="/wiki/Nervous_system" id="w">nervous system</a>, it primarily infects <a href="/wiki/Cartilage" id="w">cartilage</a> and <a href="/wiki/Skeleton" id="w">skeletal tissue</a>.  Attempts to change the name to <i>Myxobolus chondrophagus</i>, which would more accurately describe the organism, failed because of <a href="/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature" id="w">nomenclature rules</a>.<sup id="_ref-Barth_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barth" title="">[1]</a></sup>  Later, it became apparent that organisms previously called <i>Triactinomyxon dubium</i> and <i>T. gyrosalmo</i> (<a href="/wiki/Class_(biology)" id="w">class</a> <a href="/wiki/Actinosporea" id="w">Actinosporea</a>) were in fact triactinomyxon stages of <i>M. cerebralis,</i> whose life cycle was expanded to include the triactinomyxon stage.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Similarly, other actinosporeans were folded into the life cycles of various myxosporeans.</p>
<p>Today, the myxozoans, previously thought to be multicellular <a href="/wiki/Protozoans" id="w">protozoans</a> are considered <a href="/wiki/Animal" id="w">animals</a> by many scientists, though their status has not officially changed.  Recent molecular studies suggest that they are related to <a href="/wiki/Bilateria" id="w">Bilateria</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cnidaria" id="w">Cnidaria</a>, with Cnidaria being closer morphologically because both groups have extrusive filaments,<sup id="_ref-Hedrick_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hedrick" title="">[5]</a></sup> but with Bilateria being somewhat closer in some genetic studies.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<i>M. cerebralis</i> has many diverse stages ranging from single <a href="/wiki/Cell_(biology)" id="w">cells</a> to relatively large spores, not all of which have been studied in detail. </p>
<a id="Triactinomyxon_stage" name="Triactinomyxon_stage"></a><h3>Triactinomyxon stage</h3>
<p>The stages that infect fish, called <a href="/wiki/Triactinomyxon" id="w">triactinomyxon</a> spores, are made of a single style that is about 150 <a href="/wiki/Micrometre" id="w">micrometers</a> (µm) long and three processes or &#34;tails&#34; that are each about 200 micrometers long. A <a href="/wiki/Sporoplasm" id="w">sporoplasm</a> packet at the end of the style contains 64 germ cells surrounded by a cellular envelope.<sup id="_ref-Hedrick_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hedrick" title="">[5]</a></sup>  There are also three <a href="/wiki/Polar_capsule" id="w">polar capsules</a>, each of which contains a coiled <a href="/wiki/Polar_filament" id="w">polar filament</a> between 170 and 180 µm long.<sup id="_ref-Markiw_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Markiw" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Polar filaments in both this stage and in the <a href="/wiki/Myxospore" id="w">myxospore</a> stage (see picture above) rapidly shoot into the body of the host, creating an opening through which the sporoplasm can enter.</p>
<a id="Sporoplasm_stage" name="Sporoplasm_stage"></a><h3>Sporoplasm stage</h3>
<p>Upon contact with fish hosts and firing of the polar capsules, the sporoplasm contained within the central style of the triactinomyxon migrates into the epithelium or gut lining. Firstly, this sporoplasm undergoes <a href="/wiki/Mitosis" id="w">mitosis</a> to produce more <a href="/wiki/Amoeboid" id="w">amoeboid</a> cells, which migrate into deeper tissue layers, in order to reach the cerebral cartilage.<sup id="_ref-Markiw_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Markiw" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Myxosporean_stage" name="Myxosporean_stage"></a><h3>Myxosporean stage</h3>
<p>Myxospores, which develop from <a href="/wiki/Sporogonic" id="w">sporogonic</a> cell stages inside fish hosts, are lenticular.  They have a diameter of about 10  micrometers and are made of six cells.  Two of these cells form polar capsules, two merge to form a binucleate sporoplasm, and two form protective valves.<sup id="_ref-Hedrick_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hedrick" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Myxospores are infective to oligochaetes, and are found among the remains of digested fish cartilage.  They are often difficult to distinguish from related species because of morphological similarities across <a href="/wiki/Genus" id="w">genera</a>.  Though <i>M. cerebralis</i> is the only myxosporean ever found in salmonid cartilage, other visually similar species may be present in the skin, <a href="/wiki/Nervous_system" id="w">nervous system</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Muscle" id="w">muscle</a>.<sup id="_ref-Markiw_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Markiw" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Life cycle of <i>M. cerebralis.</i> Click to enlarge.</div></div>

<i>Myxobolus cerebralis</i> has a two-host life-cycle involving a salmonid fish and a tubificid oligochaete. So far, the only worm known to be susceptible to <i>M. cerebralis</i> infection is <i><a href="/wiki/Tubifex_tubifex" id="w">Tubifex tubifex</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-Markiw_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Markiw" title="">[2]</a></sup> though what scientists currently call <i>T. tubifex</i> may in fact be more than one species.<sup id="_ref-Gilbert_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilbert" title="">[3]</a></sup>  First, myxospores are ingested by tubificid worms. In the <a href="/wiki/Gut" id="w">gut</a> <a href="/wiki/Lumen" id="w">lumen</a> of the worm, the spores extrude their <a href="/wiki/Polar_capsule" id="w">polar capsules</a> and attach to the gut <a href="/wiki/Epithelium" id="w">epithelium</a> by <a href="/wiki/Polar_filament" id="w">polar filaments</a>. The shell valves then open along the suture line and the binucleate germ cell penetrates between the intestinal epithelial cells of the worm. This cell multiplies, producing many <a href="/wiki/Amoeboid" id="w">amoeboid</a> cells by an asexual cell <a href="/wiki/Binary_fission" id="w">fission</a> process called <a href="/wiki/Merogony" id="w">merogony</a>. As a result of the multiplication process, the intercellular space of the epithelial cells in more than 10 neighbouring worm segments may become infected.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Around 60&#8211;90 days post-infection, sexual cell stages of the parasite undergo <a href="/wiki/Sporogenesis" id="w">sporogenesis</a>, and develop into <a href="/wiki/Pansporocyst" id="w">pansporocysts</a>, each of which contains eight triactinomyxon-stage spores. These spores are released from the oligochaete anus into the water.<sup id="_ref-Hedrick_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hedrick" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Alternatively, a fish can become infected by eating an infected oligochaete.<sup id="_ref-Hedrick_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hedrick" title="">[5]</a></sup> Infected tubificids can release triactinomyxons for at least 1 year.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The triactinomyxon spores swim through the water to infect a salmonid through the skin.  Penetration of the fish by these spores takes only a few seconds. Within five minutes, a sac of germ cells called a <a href="/wiki/Sporoplasm" id="w">sporoplasm</a> has entered the fish <a href="/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)" id="w">epidermis</a>, and within a few hours, the sporoplasm splits into individual cells that will spread through the fish.<sup id="_ref-Hedrick_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hedrick" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Within the fish, there are both intracellular and extracellular stages that reproduce in its cartilage by asexual <a href="/wiki/Endogeny" id="w">endogeny</a>, meaning that new cells grow from within old cells.  The final stage within fish is the myxospore, which is formed by <a href="/wiki/Sporogony" id="w">sporogony</a>.  They are released into the environment when the fish decomposes or is eaten.<sup id="_ref-Hedrick_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hedrick" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Some recent research indicates that some fish may expel viable myxospores while still alive.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Myxospores are extremely tough: &#34;it was shown that <i>Myxobolus cerebralis</i> spores can tolerate freezing at ­-20°C for at least 3 months, aging in mud at 13°C for at least 5 months, and passage through the guts of <a href="/wiki/Northern_pike" id="w">northern pike</a> <i>Esox lucius</i> or <a href="/wiki/Mallard" id="w">mallards</a> <i>Anas platyrhynchos</i> without loss of infectivity&#34; to worms.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>  Triactinomyxons are much shorter lived, surviving 34 days or less, depending on temperature.<sup id="_ref-Markiw2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Markiw2" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p><i>M. cerebralis</i> infections have been reported from a wide range of salmonid species: 8 species of &#34;Atlantic&#34; salmonids, <i><a href="/wiki/Salmo" id="w">Salmo</a></i>; 4 species of &#34;Pacific&#34; salmonids, <i><a href="/wiki/Oncorhynchus" id="w">Oncorhynchus</a></i>; 4 species of Char, <i><a href="/wiki/Salvelinus" id="w">Salvelinus</a></i>; the Grayling, <i><a href="/wiki/Thymallus_thymallus" id="w">Thymallus thymallus</a></i>; and the Huchen, <i><a href="/wiki/Hucho_hucho" id="w">Hucho hucho</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> <i>M. cerebralis</i> causes damage to its fish hosts through attachment of triactinomyxon spores and the migrations of various stages through tissues and along nerves, as well as by digesting cartilage.<sup id="_ref-Hedrick_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hedrick" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The fish&#39;s tail may darken, but aside from lesions on cartilage, internal organs generally appear healthy.<sup id="_ref-Markiw_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Markiw" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Other symptoms include skeletal deformities and &#34;whirling&#34; behavior (tail-chasing) in young fish, which was thought to have been caused by a loss of equilibrium, but is actually caused by damage to the spinal cord and lower brain stem.<sup id="_ref-Gilbert_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilbert" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Experiments have shown that fish can kill <i>Myxobolus</i> in their skin (possibly using <a href="/wiki/Antibodies" id="w">antibodies</a>), but that the fish do not attack the parasites once they have migrated to the central nervous system.  This response varies from species to species.<sup id="_ref-Gilbert_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilbert" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <i>T. tubifex</i>, the release of triactinomyxon spores from the <a href="/wiki/Intestine" id="w">intestinal</a> wall damages the worm’s <a href="/wiki/Mucosa" id="w">mucosa</a>; this may happen thousands of times in a single worm, and it is believed that this can impair nutrient absorption.<sup id="_ref-Hedrick_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hedrick" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Also, infected worms have lower body mass and may be discolored.<sup id="_ref-Gilbert_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilbert" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Spores are released from the worm almost exclusively when the temperature is between 10°C and 15°C, so fish in warmer or cooler waters are less likely to be infected, and infection rates vary seasonally.<sup id="_ref-Gilbert_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilbert" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Susceptibility" name="Susceptibility"></a><h3>Susceptibility</h3>
<p>Fish size, age, concentration of triactinomyxon spores, and water temperature all affect infection rates in fish, as does the species of the fish in question.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>  The disease has the biggest impact on fish less than five months old because their skeleton has not <a href="/wiki/Ossification" id="w">ossified</a>.

<p>Moderate or heavy clinical infection of fish with whirling disease can be presumptively diagnosed on the basis of changes in behavior and appearance about 35 to 80 days after initial infection, though &#34;injury or deficiency in dietary <a href="/wiki/Tryptophan" id="w">tryptophan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ascorbic_acid" id="w">ascorbic acid</a> can evoke similar signs,&#34; so conclusive diagnosis may require finding myxospores in the fish&#39;s cartilage.<sup id="_ref-Markiw_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Markiw" title="">[2]</a></sup>  In heavy infections, examining cartilage microscopically may be all that is needed to find spores.<sup id="_ref-Markiw_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Markiw" title="">[2]</a></sup> In less severe infections the most common test involves digestion of the cranial cartilage with the <a href="/wiki/Protease" id="w">proteases</a> <a href="/wiki/Pepsin" id="w">pepsin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Trypsin" id="w">trypsin</a> (the pepsin-trypsin digest&#8212;PTD) before looking for spores.

<p>The impact of <i>M. cerebralis</i> in Europe is somewhat lessened by the fact that the species is endemic to this region, giving native <a href="/wiki/Fish_stocks" id="w">fish stocks</a> a degree of <a href="/wiki/Immunity_(medical)" id="w">immunity</a>. <a href="/wiki/Rainbow_trout" id="w">Rainbow trout</a>, the most susceptible species to this parasite, are not native to Europe; successfully reproducing <a href="/wiki/Feral" id="w">feral</a> populations are rare, so there are few wild rainbow trout that are young enough to be susceptible to infection.  On the other hand, they are widely reared for restocking <a href="/wiki/Fishing#Recreational fishing" id="w">sport-fishing</a> waters and for <a href="/wiki/Aquaculture" id="w">aquaculture</a>, where this parasite has its greatest impact. Hatching and rearing methods designed to prevent infection of Rainbow trout fry have proved successful in Europe. These techniques include hatching eggs in spore-free water and rearing fry to the &#34;ossification&#34; stage in tanks or raceways. These methods give particular attention to the quality of water sources in order to guard against spore introduction during water exchanges.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Fry are moved to earthen ponds only when they are considered to be clinically resistant to the parasite, after skeletal ossification occurs.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Impact_in_New_Zealand" name="Impact_in_New_Zealand"></a><h3>Impact in New Zealand</h3>
<p><i>M. cerebralis</i> was first found in <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a> in 1971. The parasite has only been found in rivers in the South Island, away from the most important aquaculture sites.  Additionally, salmonid species commercially aquacultured in New Zealand have low susceptibility to whirling disease, and the parasite has also not been shown to affect native salmonids.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> An important indirect effect of the parasites presence is <a href="/wiki/Quarantine" id="w">quarantine</a> restriction placed on <a href="/wiki/Export" id="w">exports</a> of salmon products to <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>.</p>

<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/image:US_Range_of_Mcerebralis.png" title="&#39;&#39;M. cerebralis&#39;&#39; has been reported in nearly two dozen (green) states in the United States, according to the [http://whirlingdisease.montana.edu/ Whirling Disease Initiative"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Range_of_Mcerebralis.png" alt="&#39;&#39;M. cerebralis&#39;&#39; has been reported in nearly two dozen (green) states in the United States, according to the [http://whirlingdisease.montana.edu/ Whirling Disease Initiative" title="&#39;&#39;M. cerebralis&#39;&#39; has been reported in nearly two dozen (green) states in the United States, according to the [http://whirlingdisease.montana.edu/ Whirling Disease Initiative" class="location-right type-thumb" />

<div class="thumbcaption"><i>M. cerebralis</i> has been reported in nearly two dozen (green) states in the United States, according to the [<a class="externallink" href="http://whirlingdisease.montana.edu/" rel="nofollow" title="http://whirlingdisease.montana.edu/">http://whirlingdisease.montana.edu/</a> Whirling Disease Initiative</div>]</p>
<p><i>M. cerebralis</i> was first recorded in North America in 1956 in <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a>, having been introduced via infected trout imported from Europe, and has spread steadily south and westwards.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Until the 1990s, whirling disease was considered a manageable problem affecting rainbow trout in hatcheries. However, it has recently become established in natural waters of the Rocky Mountain states (<a href="/wiki/Colorado" id="w">Colorado</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wyoming" id="w">Wyoming</a>, <a href="/wiki/Utah" id="w">Utah</a>, <a href="/wiki/Montana" id="w">Montana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Idaho" id="w">Idaho</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico" id="w">New Mexico</a>) where it is causing heavy mortalities in several sportfishing rivers. Some streams in the western United States have lost 90% of their trout.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> In addition, whirling disease threatens recreational fishing, which is important for the tourism industry, a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states. For example, &#34;the <a href="/wiki/Montana" id="w">Montana</a> Whirling Disease Task Force estimated that trout fishing generated US $300,000,000 in recreational expenditures in Montana alone&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Gilbert_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilbert" title="">[3]</a></sup> Making matters worse, some of the fishes that <i>M. cerebralis</i> infects (<a href="/wiki/Bull_trout" id="w">bull trout</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cutthroat_trout" id="w">cutthroat trout</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Steelhead" id="w">steelhead</a>) are already threatened or <a href="/wiki/Endangered_species" id="w">endangered</a>, and the parasite could worsen their already precarious situations.<sup id="_ref-Gilbert_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilbert" title="">[3]</a></sup>  For reasons that are poorly understood, but probably have to do with environmental conditions, the impact on infected fish has been greatest in Colorado and Montana and least in <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>, <a href="/wiki/Michigan" id="w">Michigan</a>, and <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Prevention_and_control" name="Prevention_and_control"></a><h2>Prevention and control</h2>
<p>Some biologists have attempted to disarm triactinomyxon spores by making them fire prematurely.  In the laboratory, only extreme <a href="/wiki/Acidity" id="w">acidity</a> or <a href="/wiki/Basicity" id="w">basicity</a>, moderate to high concentrations of salts, or electrical current caused premature filament discharge; neurochemicals, cnidarian <a href="/wiki/Chemosensitizer" id="w">chemosensitizers</a>, and trout mucous were ineffective,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> as were anesthetized or dead fish.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup>  If spores could be disarmed, they would be unable to infect fish, but it is unclear whether any of the methods that worked in the laboratory could be employed in the wild.</p>
<p>Some strains of fish are more resistant than others, even within species<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup>; using resistant strains may help reduce the incidence and severity of whirling disease in aquaculture.  There is also some circumstantial evidence that fish populations can develop resistance to the disease over time.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>  Additionally, <a href="/wiki/Aquaculture" id="w">aquaculturists</a> may avoid <i>M. cerebralis</i> infections by not using earthen ponds for raising young fish; this keeps them away from possibly infected tubificids and makes it easier to eliminate spores and oligochaetes through filtration, chlorination, and ultraviolet bombardment.<sup id="_ref-Markiw_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Markiw" title="">[2]</a></sup> To minimise tubificid population techniques include periodic disinfection of the hatchery or aquaculture ponds and the rearing of small trout indoors in pathogen-free water. Smooth-faced concrete or plastic-lined raceways that are kept clean and free of contaminated water keep aquaculture facilities free of the disease.<sup id="_ref-Markiw_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Markiw" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lastly, some drugs such as <a href="/wiki/Furazolidone" id="w">furazolidone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Furoxone" id="w">furoxone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Benomyl" id="w">benomyl</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fumagillin" id="w">fumagillin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Proguanil" id="w">proguanil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Clamoxyquine" id="w">clamoxyquine</a> have been shown to impede spore development, which reduces infection rates.<sup id="_ref-Markiw_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Markiw" title="">[2]</a></sup>  For example, one study showed that feeding Fumagillin to <i><a href="/wiki/Oncorhynchus_mykiss" id="w">Oncorhynchus mykiss</a></i> reduced the number of infected fish from between 73% and 100% to between 10% and 20%.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup>  Unfortunately, this treatment is considered unsuitable for wild trout populations,<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> and no drug treatment has ever been shown to be effective in the studies required for <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration" id="w">Food and Drug Administration</a> approval.<sup id="_ref-Gilbert_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilbert" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Recreational and sports fishers can help to prevent the spread of the parasite in a number of ways. Cleaning fishing equipment between fishing trips and never transporting fish from one body of water to another should protect against cross contamination of waterways. Spores are particularly persistent in felt soled wading shoes, which can be treated with 10% chlorine <a href="/wiki/Bleach" id="w">bleach</a> and water for at least 15 minutes and then rinsed thoroughly. Fish <a href="/wiki/Bone" id="w">bones</a> or entrails should never be disposed of in any body of water, since spores from the carcass will be released into the waterway. Salmon and trout should not be used as <a href="/wiki/Bait_(luring_substance)" id="w">bait</a>.</p>
