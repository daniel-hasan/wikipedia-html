<p>The <b>Exiles</b> are a group of <a href="/wiki/Fiction" id="w">fictional</a> <a href="/wiki/Comic_book" id="w">comic book</a> characters from <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Comics" id="w">Marvel Comics</a>. The Exiles, created by writer <a href="/wiki/Judd_Winick" id="w">Judd Winick</a> and artist <a href="/wiki/Mike_McKone" id="w">Mike McKone</a>, consists of characters from different dimensions, or realities, which have been removed from time and space in order to correct problems (often called “hiccups&#34;) in various alternate worlds and divergent timelines in the <a href="/wiki/Multiverse_(Marvel_Comics)" id="w">multiverse</a>. The team usually is made up of six members and each time a member is killed or returned to his or her home reality, a new member is introduced and joins the team. However, the series is notable for the number of characters who stay dead, in contrast to the <a href="/wiki/Comic_book_death" id="w">frequent resurrections</a> that occur in the main Marvel and DC continuities.</p>
<a id="Fictional_team_biography" name="Fictional_team_biography"></a><h2>Fictional team biography</h2>
<p>The Exiles team consisted originally of <a href="/wiki/Blink_(comics)" id="w">Blink</a> (Clarice Ferguson, from the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Apocalypse" id="w">Age of Apocalypse</a> continuity), <a href="/wiki/Mimic_(comics)#Exiles" id="w">Mimic</a> (Calvin Rankin), Magnus (son of <a href="/wiki/Magneto_(comics)" id="w">Magneto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rogue_(comics)" id="w">Rogue</a>), <a href="/wiki/Thunderbird_(comics)#Exiles" id="w">Thunderbird</a> (John Proudstar), <a href="/wiki/Nocturne_(comics)" id="w">Nocturne</a> (Talia Josephine &#34;T.J.&#34; Wagner, daughter of <a href="/wiki/Nightcrawler_(comics)" id="w">Nightcrawler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scarlet_Witch" id="w">Scarlet Witch</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Changeling_(Marvel_Comics)#Exiles" id="w">Morph</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>When Magnus dies<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>, he is replaced by <a href="/wiki/Sunfire_(Exiles)" id="w">Sunfire</a> (Mariko Yashida). <a href="/wiki/Heather_Hudson_(Exiles)" id="w">Sasquatch</a> (Heather Hudson) arrives when Thunderbird becomes comatose during a battle with the world-eating <a href="/wiki/Galactus" id="w">Galactus</a><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Exiles then discover there is a second team conscripted by the <a href="/wiki/Timebroker" id="w">Timebroker</a>, <a href="/wiki/Weapon_X_(Exiles)" id="w">Weapon X</a><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>, whose missions typically involve killing or maiming innocents and heroes. The two teams join forces to rescue a group of children from a <a href="/wiki/Sentinel_(comics)" id="w">Sentinel</a> prison camp. However, the teams are told the second stage of the mission is to kill one of the children - David Richards (son of <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Summers" id="w">Rachel Summers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Franklin_Richards" id="w">Franklin Richards</a>) - who will apparently grow up to become a powerful super villain. Weapon X is willing to kill him, but the Exiles are not and the two teams fight until the Timebroker intervenes. Sabretooth (of the Weapon X team) agrees to stay behind and raise David Richards himself.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Timebroker" id="w">Timebroker</a> sends Blink home after a visit to a world plagued by a variant of the <a href="/wiki/Legacy_Virus" id="w">Legacy Virus</a>, since the team had repaired her personal broken chain in time<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Magik_(comics)" id="w">Magik</a> (Illyana Rasputin) takes her place. Mimic then replaces Blink as leader, gaining the Tallus.</p>
<p>The Exiles arrive in the main <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Universe" id="w">Marvel Universe</a> (<a href="/wiki/Earth-616" id="w">Earth-616</a>) where they meet the <a href="/wiki/X-Men" id="w">X-Men</a> after <a href="/wiki/Havok_(X-Men)" id="w">Havok</a>&#39;s cancelled wedding<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>. The Exiles team up with the X-Men against an evil Havok from the <i><a href="/wiki/Mutant_X_(comics)" id="w">Mutant X</a></i> universe, who shares a body with the good Havok. After Havok is subdued, the Timebroker arrives to personally eliminate the <i>Mutant X</i> Havok&#39;s consciousness.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>After <a href="/wiki/Sunfire_(Exiles)" id="w">Sunfire</a> is killed by a <a href="/wiki/Brood_(comics)" id="w">Brood</a>-infected <a href="/wiki/Mimic_(comics)#Exiles" id="w">Mimic</a><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>, she is replaced by the Exiles&#39; former teammate <a href="/wiki/Blink_(comics)" id="w">Blink</a>. During the next mission<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>, the Exiles and Weapon X are forced to battle each other until only six remain alive. <a href="/wiki/Magik_(comics)" id="w">Magik</a> is killed by Hyperion when she attempts to switch sides and betray the Exiles. Hyperion is eventually defeated by Blink, who teleports his own <a href="/wiki/Heat_vision" id="w">heat vision</a> into his back, paralyzing him. <a href="/wiki/Alternate_versions_of_Gambit#Exiles/Weapon X" id="w">Gambit</a> (of Weapon X) is allowed to deliver the killing blow against Hyperion with Magik&#39;s sword, which actually kills them both, leaving five Exiles alive and their mission complete.</p>
<p>The Exiles visit the main Marvel Universe for a second time<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> where they are joined by <a href="/wiki/Namora" id="w">Namora</a>, who replaces Magik, and are instructed to &#34;leave their possessions and earn their wings&#34;. Reed Richards deduces this means they are to leave <a href="/wiki/Nocturne_(comics)" id="w">Nocturne</a> behind (whose power involves <a href="/wiki/Possession" id="w">possession</a>) and have <a href="/wiki/Beak_(comics)" id="w">Beak</a> join the Exiles, which is confirmed by the <a href="/wiki/Timebroker" id="w">Timebroker</a>.</p>
<a id="The_Timebreakers" name="The_Timebreakers"></a><h3>The Timebreakers</h3>
<p>The team are told by <a href="/wiki/Celestial_(comics)" id="w">The Celestials</a> to &#34;beware the Timebreaker, he is not what he seems&#34;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>. After this, the Timebroker&#39;s behavior becomes increasingly strange. <a href="/wiki/Heather_Hudson_(Exiles)" id="w">Heather Hudson</a> is removed from the team<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> without explanation and replaced with former <a href="/wiki/Weapon_X_(Exiles)" id="w">Weapon X</a> member <a href="/wiki/Sabretooth_(comics)#Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles" id="w">Sabretooth</a>. The Tallus orders the Exiles to kill <a href="/wiki/Mimic_(comics)" id="w">Mimic</a> and despite their refusal, they are allowed to move onto a new mission (normally a mission <i>must</i> be completed for the Exiles to move on). Next, the Timebroker replaces Beak with <a href="/wiki/Holocaust_(comics)" id="w">Holocaust</a><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>, which they are informed is a punishment for disobeying previous orders.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Exiles break free of the Timebroker and stage a raid on Panoptichron (also known as the &#34;Crystal Palace&#34;), home of the Timebroker and a location from which many parallel universes can be monitored. Here they discover that the Timebrokers are an alien race of bug-like beings that found the Panoptichron and accidentally broke a series of timelines. Lacking the power to repair the timelines, they concocted this scheme of recruiting heroes from various worlds to do their work for them.  Not only that, all previously &#34;returned&#34; heroes are actually in Panoptichron, frozen in blocks, along with the killed heroes. As a final twist, the evil Hyperion has broken free of his prison and has taken over Panoptichron. The Exiles defeat Hyperion, but at the cost of Namora and Holocaust&#39;s lives. Beak returns from stasis and saved the day by calling on two good versions of Hyperion for help, fulfilling his destiny as an Exile. Only Blink, Mimic, Morph, Sabretooth, Beak, and Heather Hudson remain to pick up the pieces.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<a id="World_Tour" name="World_Tour"></a><h3>World Tour</h3>
<p>The Exiles then return to <a href="/wiki/Earth-616" id="w">Earth-616</a> to take Beak home. Unfortunately, Earth-616 is dominated by the <a href="/wiki/House_of_M" id="w">House of M</a>. During their stay, the Exiles run afoul of the body-hopping serial killer <a href="/wiki/Proteus_(comics)" id="w">Proteus</a>, who steals data from the Panoptichron and escapes from <a href="/wiki/Earth-616" id="w">Earth-616</a>, leaving Beak <a href="/wiki/Decimation_(comics)" id="w">depowered</a> back home<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>. The Exiles chase Proteus through several realities, including an alternate version of <a href="/wiki/New_Universe" id="w">New Universe</a><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>, an alternate version of <a href="/wiki/Marvel_2099" id="w">2099</a><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>, <a href="/wiki/Squadron_Supreme" id="w">Squadron Supreme</a><sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>, <a href="/wiki/Alternate_versions_of_Hulk#The Maestro" id="w">Future Imperfect</a><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup>, and <a href="/wiki/Heroes_Reborn" id="w">Heroes Reborn</a><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>, before finally bringing Proteus down by trapping him in Morph’s body, which does not decay, unlike all of Proteus’ other host bodies. During the “World Tour” of hunting down Proteus, Mimic is possessed by Proteus and dies, forcing the Exiles to pick up new members <a href="/wiki/Longshot" id="w">Longshot</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spider-Man_2099" id="w">Spider-Man 2099</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Power_Princess" id="w">Power Princess</a> to restore their diminished numbers.</p>
<a id="Post-World_Tour" name="Post-World_Tour"></a><h3>Post-World Tour</h3>
<p>The Exiles begin cleaning out the stasis gallery of former Exiles and Weapon X members and send them back home. Iron Man, Daredevil, and Angel are sent back to their respective realities alive, while every other Earth with a missing superhuman holds a funeral. Blink, at the suggestion of Power Princess, takes Mimic home to be buried with his X-Men instead of burying him in Panoptichron. Spider-Man, Sabretooth, and Heather Hudson all decided to visit their home realities<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup>. Unfortunately, the Timebreakers ditch the Exiles when the Timebreakers believe that they are not saving realities as they should be. However, after using several squads of Wolverines to complete the next mission and failing, Logan (from <a href="/wiki/Days_of_Future_Past" id="w">Days of Future Past</a>) and young James Howlett convince the Timebreakers that the Exiles are needed<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>. The Exiles finally resume their reality-saving missions for the first time since they discovered Panoptichron when they save a reality where the <a href="/wiki/Silver_Surfer" id="w">Silver Surfer</a> has already destroyed the Earth and is trying to destroy <a href="/wiki/Galactus" id="w">Galactus</a>, who is the restorer of worlds in this reality<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Then, Heather discovers an Earth inhabited by a disturbingly close approximation of the original Exiles team, complete with their own Timebroker. After the &#34;classic Exiles&#34; fight &#34;the all-new Exiles&#34; (as Morph put it), it is later revealed that the whole thing was a scheme orchestrated by the <a href="/wiki/Grandmaster_(comics)" id="w">Grandmaster</a>, who seeks revenge on the Exiles for freeing Professor X on their first mission and ruining a bet. The Exiles, past and present, join forces with the <a href="/wiki/Wrecking_Crew_(comics)" id="w">Wrecking Crew</a> of that Earth to defeat the Grandmaster. The current team then leaves the Earth in the hands of the approximation Exiles.</p>
<p>The Exiles then take three weeks to save a chain of cracked realities, injuring Blink, Morph, and Spider-Man. They also discover that Proteus is possibly immune to metal while in Morph’s body. Meanwhile, former Exile, Thunderbird, is in the stasis gallery, dreaming of what might have been had he not become comatose.</p>
<a id="Enter_Psylocke" name="Enter_Psylocke"></a><h3>Enter Psylocke</h3>
<p>Later, <a href="/wiki/Power_Princess" id="w">Power Princess</a> leaves the team to return to the <a href="/wiki/Squadron_Supreme" id="w">Squadron Supreme</a> and <a href="/wiki/Psylocke" id="w">Psylocke</a> is brought on board to replace her.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Blink, Longshot, and Spider-Man are brainwashed by Hydra leaving only Sabretooth to pick up Morph and Psylocke. They are sent to kill Reed Richards. <a href="/wiki/Slaymaster" id="w">Slaymaster</a>&#39;s arrival makes them fail as Betsy faints before killing Reed. The world was erased, with the Exiles still there, but it was magically restored by Reed Richards, and Valeria Richards&#39; amulet restores the world&#39;s population because they were being stored in the amulet. The Exiles are still there so they can help Psylocke recover from wounds inflicted by Wolverine, and to help rebuild the planet<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup>. Meanwhile, another Slaymaster slays another Psylocke on another world.</p>
<p>After the Exiles return to Panoptichron, they find it empty, with no equipment, Timebreakers, or Heather. Blink and Morph eventually visit Heather, who thought the Exiles were dead and left Panoptichron. Heather is now pregnant and out of commission, so <a href="/wiki/Psylocke" id="w">Psylocke</a> stays behind to learn more about the Panoptichron while the other Exiles resume their missions. There she experiences visions which warn her of something bad to come, and an alternate version of <a href="/wiki/Kitty_Pryde" id="w">Kitty Pryde</a> appears from nowhere with no warning. The Exiles go to a seemingly perfect world led by Victor Von Doom but when Blink is caught by Reed Richards she begins to discover what hides behind this facade<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup>. She then recruits Longshot and Morph, who also sense something amiss with this world. They flee with that world&#39;s Reed to begin a resistance. Meanwhile, Spider-Man 2099 meets <a href="/wiki/Gwen_Stacy" id="w">Gwen Stacy</a> and Sabretooth has a <a href="/wiki/One-night_stand" id="w">one-night stand</a> with this world&#39;s Invisible Woman. In reality, she was assigned to get close to him so Doom could copy the Tallus, which he does. He then sends a team of soldiers to Panoptichron. They take out Psylocke and assume Kitty Pryde is a freaked out child, though she appears to be faking that. Then the soldiers are attacked by <a href="/wiki/Thunderbird_(comics)" id="w">Thunderbird</a>, who is no longer comatose<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup>. Kitty Pryde (who goes by Cat), uses her phasing powers to make a diversion long enough to allow Thunderbird to free Psylocke. Together, they defeat the soldiers and send them home, just in time for them to see Doom&#39;s defeat, whose Earth is destroyed by Reed Richards as there is no way to turn the human back to their normal emotional state.</p>
<p>As a result the Exiles are scattered to various dimensions<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup>, much like <a href="/wiki/Union_Jack_(comics)" id="w">Union Jack</a> had done previously<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup>. Psylocke, Thunderbird, and Cat are able to work on the equipment and retrieve Blink, Morph, and Sabretooth, and new members <a href="/wiki/Mystique_(comics)#Exiles" id="w">Mystiq</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rogue_(comics)#Exiles" id="w">Rogue</a> are brought along. Spider-Man 2099 finds a girlfriend and stays on the world he landed in. Longshot, once again, got lucky and landed in the Crystal Palace after the transport went wrong.</p>
<a id="''Die_by_the_Sword''" name="''Die_by_the_Sword''"></a><h3>&#39;&#39;Die by the Sword&#39;&#39;</h3>

Psylocke and Thunderbird traveled to Earth-616 to visit <a href="/wiki/Captain_Britain" id="w">Captain Britain</a> and Nocturne during <a href="/wiki/Excalibur_(comics)#New Excalibur (2005-2007)" id="w">New Excalibur</a>&#39;s victory party<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>. However during the party Captain Britain is wounded by a strike force led by an armored lady called Rouge. While Betsy tries to care for her brother everybody else tries to fight, even <a href="/wiki/Dazzler_(comics)" id="w">Dazzler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pete_Wisdom" id="w">Pete Wisdom</a> who were about to have sex, but, realizing they can&#39;t win they teleport to the Panoptichron. There Dazzler discovers that Longshot, while alive, doesn&#39;t remember her and is about to kill herself to ease her pain when Mystiq comes to talk her out of it. TJ happily reunites with her former teammates while <a href="/wiki/Sage_(comics)" id="w">Sage</a> is deemed the best option to care for Brian. Meanwhile Cat, using the scanner, realizes that <a href="/wiki/Roma_(comics)" id="w">Roma</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saturnyne" id="w">Saturnyne</a> are in trouble<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup>. The Corps then suffers a lot of losses, despite Saturnyne&#39;s intervening. While Cat checks on Brian, Blink, Morph, Sabertooth, Thunderbird, and Dazzler join the battle field<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup>. Dazzler battles Rouge-Mort,who has badly wounded Roma, and Longshot gets concerned about her, making both himself and Sage wonder why/how, while Morph battles Jasper by morphing into the Fury but his plan is quickly foiled. Sage, Psylocke, and Wisdom recruit Albion to their cause, who proves to be a match for James Jaspers until Jaspers turns into the Fury. Merlyn then comes to his daughter to finish the job<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>only to be beaten by Psylocke. Cap then makes his move on the Fury and with the help of Blink and Albion vanquishes him for now, leading to Merlyn&#39;s defeat. However this victory comes with a price as Roma dies, though not before transferring her knowledge into Sage&#39;s mind. Saturnyn then promises to free Albion from jail to lead the Corps while Sage and TJ switch teams with Longshot who now remembers the highlights of his past<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup>.</p>

<a id="Tallus" name="Tallus"></a><h2>Tallus</h2>
<p>The Tallus is a communications device, which is worn by the leader of the group, which was formerly used by the Timebroker to assign each mission. Blink wears the Tallus in the beginning, but it is later transferred to Sabretooth when Blink rebels against the Timebroker (later revealed to be Hyperion). Mimic also wears the Tallus for a time in Blink&#39;s absence. It is now used as a means of communication between its wearer and whoever is operating the crystal palace on various missions. It has a slightly different appearance for each wearer.</p>
<a id="Weapon_X" name="Weapon_X"></a><h2>Weapon X</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>First seen in <i>Exiles</i> #5, they are a team that did more ruthless missions than the Exiles did. This team had various members and its roster changed more than the Exiles. Weapon X was originally composed of <a href="/wiki/Sabretooth_(comics)#Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles" id="w">Sabretooth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Garrison_Kane#Exiles" id="w">Kane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mesmero#Exiles" id="w">Mesmero</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alternate_versions_of_Wolverine#Exiles &amp; Weapon X" id="w">Wolverine</a>, <a href="/wiki/David_North_(comics)#Exiles" id="w">Maverick</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Deadpool_(comics)#Exiles" id="w">Deadpool</a>. The team was destroyed during the &#34;A Blink in Time&#34; arc, when the Timebroker wanted to downsize both teams in hopes of killing off the insane <a href="/wiki/Hyperion_(comics)#Exiles" id="w">Hyperion</a>, who abandoned missions to try to rule worlds.</p>
<a id="Exiles_characters" name="Exiles_characters"></a><h2>Exiles characters</h2>
<p>Whenever one of the Exiles dies, is sent home, or something happens to them, they are replaced by someone else, and thus the roster changes. The first occurrence is when Magnus dies in Exiles #2, and Sunfire comes on board to replace him. The current Exiles roster is:</p>
