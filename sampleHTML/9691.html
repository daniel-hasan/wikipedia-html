The City of Exeter was established on the east side of the <a href="/wiki/River_Exe" id="w">River Exe</a> on a ridge of land backed by a steep hill. It is at this point that the Exe, having just been joined by the <a href="/wiki/River_Creedy" id="w">River Creedy</a> opens onto a wide flood plain and estuary. flooding is quite common. Historically this was the lowest bridging point of the river Exe, and was tidal and navigable up to the city until the construction of weirs later in its history. This combined with the easily defensible higher ground of the ridge made the current location of the city a natural choice for settlement and trade.  In George Oliver&#39;s <i>The History of the City of Exeter</i>, it is noted that the most likely reasons for the original settling of what would become modern Exeter was the &#34;fertility of the surrounding countryside&#34; and the area&#39;s &#34;beautiful and commanding elevation [and] its rapid and navigable river&#34;.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Exeter sits predominantly on sandstone and conglomerate geology, although the structure of the surrounding areas is varied <a class="externallink" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/docs/swchapter/section11/topography.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/docs/swchapter/section11/topography.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/docs/swchapter/section11/topography.htm</a>.  
The topography of the ridge which forms the backbone of the city includes a <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_plug" id="w">volcanic plug</a>, on which the <a href="/wiki/Rougemont_Castle" id="w">Rougemont Castle</a> is situated. The Cathedral is placed on the edge of this ridge and is therefore visible for a considerable distance.</p>

<p>The city provides strong industries and services to a sizable area.

It is one of the three largest employers in the area (the others being the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Exeter" id="w">University of Exeter</a> and Devon <a href="/wiki/County_Council" id="w">County Council</a>), providing a welcome boost to the local <a href="/wiki/Economics" id="w">economy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Exeter_City_Council" id="w">Exeter City Council</a> are currently bidding for the city to become an <a href="/wiki/Unitary_authority" id="w">Independent Unitary Authority</a>, a status granted to nearby Plymouth and Torbay in 1998. An outline case was submitted to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in May 2006.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/26_June" id="w">26 June</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, Exeter was granted <a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_City" id="w">Fairtrade City</a> status. </p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/New_Economics_Foundation" id="w">NEF</a> survey in 2005 rated Exeter as the worst example of a <a href="/wiki/Clone_town" id="w">clone town</a> in the UK, with only a single independent store in the city&#39;s High Street, and less diversity (in terms of different categories of shop) than any other town surveyed. However, Exeter has many independent shops off the High St, such as those in Gandy Street, which was reconstructed after bombing in 1942. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Princesshay" id="w">Princesshay</a>, a post-war retail area running parallel to the High Street, was also home to a number of independent stores prior to redevelopment in 2007. It is an innovative varied development and it is still intended that a number of the new units will be let to local independent stores.</p>

<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> name for Exeter, <i>Isca Dumnoniorum </i> (&#34;Isca of the <a href="/wiki/Dumnones" id="w">Dumnones</a>&#34;), suggests that the city was originally a <a href="/wiki/Celt" id="w">Celtic</a> <a href="/wiki/Oppidum" id="w">oppidum</a>, or town, on the banks on the River <a href="/wiki/Exe" id="w">Exe</a> prior to the foundation of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Britain" id="w">Roman city</a> in about AD 50. Such early towns, or proto-cities, had been a feature of pre-Roman Gaul as described by <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar" id="w">Julius Caesar</a> in his <i><a href="/wiki/Commentarii_de_Bello_Gallico" id="w">Commentarii de Bello Gallico</a></i> (&#34;Commentaries on the Gallic Wars&#34;) and it is not improbable that they existed in neighbouring <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">Great Britain</a> as well. Isca is clearly a <a href="/wiki/Celtic_languages" id="w">Celtic</a> generic noun and the Romans felt the need to label the city Isca Dumnoniorum, or the Isca of the Dumnonii, in order to distinguish it from such settlements as <a href="/wiki/Isca_Augusta" id="w">Isca Augusta</a> (modern <a href="/wiki/Caerleon" id="w">Caerleon</a>-on-Usk in <a href="/wiki/Monmouthshire_(historic)" id="w">Monmouthshire</a>). </p>
<p>Isca Dumnoniorum was the most south-westerly Roman fortified settlement in England. Significant parts of the Roman wall remain, though the present visible structure was largely built on the orders of <a href="/wiki/Alfred_the_Great" id="w">Alfred the Great</a> to protect the far west of his kingdom following the Viking occupation of 876. Most of its route can be traced on foot. There is a substantial <a href="/wiki/Roman_baths" id="w">Roman baths</a> complex that was excavated in the 1970s,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> but because of its proximity to the cathedral, it has not been practicable to retain the excavation for public view. Exeter was also the southern starting point for the <a href="/wiki/Fosse_Way" id="w">Fosse Way</a> <a href="/wiki/Roman_road" id="w">Roman road</a>.</p>
<a id="Saxon_times" name="Saxon_times"></a><h2>Saxon times</h2>
<p>In 876 Exeter (Exanceaster) was attacked and captured by the Danes. King Alfred drove them out the next year. In 894 the city stood off another siege by Danes. However, the city fell to the Danes a second time in 1001.</p>
<p>In 1067 the city rebelled against <a href="/wiki/William_the_Conqueror" id="w">William the Conqueror</a> who promptly marched West and laid siege. The city submitted after only 18 days. Part of the capitulation agreement was that all the nobles in the city would be confirmed in their positions as long as a castle was built.</p>
<a id="Medieval_times" name="Medieval_times"></a><h2>Medieval times</h2>
<p>Exeter was held against King Stephen by <a href="/wiki/Baldwin_de_Redvers" id="w">Baldwin de Redvers</a> in 1140 and submitted only after a three month siege when the supplies of fresh water ran out.</p>

In 1537, the city was made a <a href="/wiki/County_corporate" id="w">county corporate</a>. In 1549 the city successfully withstood a month-long siege by the <a href="/wiki/Prayer_Book_Rebellion" id="w">Prayer Book rebels</a>. The Livery Dole <a href="/wiki/Almshouse" id="w">Almshouses</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chapel" id="w">Chapel</a> at <a href="/wiki/Heavitree" id="w">Heavitree</a> were founded in March 1591 and finished in 1594. They can still be seen today in the street which bears the name <i>Livery Dole</i>.</p>
<p>The city&#39;s motto, <i><a href="/wiki/Semper_fidelis" id="w">Semper fidelis</a></i>, is traditionally held to have been suggested by <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England" id="w">Elizabeth I</a>, in acknowledgement of the city&#39;s contribution of ships for the defeat of the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Armada" id="w">Spanish Armada</a> in 1588.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Exeter was at first a <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary" id="w">Parliamentary</a> town in the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" id="w">English Civil War</a> in the largely Royalist South West, but it was captured by the <a href="/wiki/Cavalier" id="w">Royalists</a> on <a href="/wiki/4_September" id="w">4 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1643" id="w">1643</a> and it remained in their control until near the end of the war, being one of the final Royalist cities to fall into Parliamentary hands. During this period, Exeter was an economically powerful city, with a strong trade of <a href="/wiki/Wool" id="w">wool</a>. This was partly due to the surrounding area which was &#34;more fertile and better inhabited than that passed over the preceding day&#34; according to Count <a href="/wiki/Lorenzo_Magalotti" id="w">Lorenzo Magalotti</a> who visited the city when he was 26 years old.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Magalotti writes of over thirty thousand people being employed in the county of Devon as part of the wool and cloth industries, merchanise that was sold to &#34;the West Indies, Spain, France and Italy&#34;.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Celia Fiennes also visited Exeter during this period, in the early 1700s. She remarked on the &#34;vast trade&#34; and &#34;incredible quantity&#34; in Exeter, recording that &#34;it turns the most money in a week of anything in England&#34;, between £10,000—£15,000.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Georgian_and_Victorian_times" name="Georgian_and_Victorian_times"></a><h2>Georgian and Victorian times</h2>
<p>Early in the English <a href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" id="w">industrial revolution</a>, Exeter&#39;s industry developed on the basis of locally available agricultural products and, since the city&#39;s location on a fast-flowing river gave it ready access to <a href="/wiki/Water_power" id="w">water power</a>, an early industrial site developed on drained marshland to the west of the city, at <a href="/wiki/Exe_Island" id="w">Exe Island</a>. However when <a href="/wiki/Steam_power" id="w">steam power</a> replaced water in the nineteenth century, Exeter was too far from sources of coal (or iron) to develop further. As a result the city declined in relative importance, and was spared the rapid <a href="/wiki/Nineteenth_century" id="w">nineteenth century</a> development that changed many historic European cities. Extensive canal redevelopments during this period further expanded Exeter&#39;s economy, with &#34;vessels of 15 to 16 tons burthen [bringing] up goods and merchandise from Topsham to the City quay&#34;.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first railway to arrive in Exeter was the <a href="/wiki/Bristol_and_Exeter_Railway" id="w">Bristol and Exeter Railway</a> that opened a station at <a href="/wiki/Exeter_St_Davids_railway_station" id="w">St Davids</a>, on the western edge, in 1844. The <a href="/wiki/South_Devon_Railway_Company" id="w">South Devon Railway Company</a> extended the line westwards to Plymouth, opening their own smaller station at <a href="/wiki/Exeter_St_Thomas_railway_station" id="w">St Thomas</a>, near the lower end of Fore Street. A more central station, that at <a href="/wiki/Exeter_Central_railway_station" id="w">Queen Street</a>, was opened by the <a href="/wiki/London_and_South_Western_Railway" id="w">London and South Western Railway</a> in 1860 when it opened its alternative route to <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>.</p>

Exeter was bombed by the <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> <a href="/wiki/Luftwaffe" id="w">Luftwaffe</a> in the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">Second World War</a>, when a total of 18 raids between 1940 and 1942 flattened much of the city centre. In 1942, as part of the <a href="/wiki/Baedeker_Blitz" id="w">Baedeker Blitz</a> and specifically in response to the <a href="/wiki/RAF" id="w">RAF</a> bombing of <a href="/wiki/Lubeck" id="w">Lubeck</a>, forty <a href="/wiki/Acre" id="w">acres</a> (160,000 m²) of the city, particularly adjacent to its central High Street and Sidwell Street, were levelled by <a href="/wiki/Incendiary_weapon" id="w">incendiary bombing</a>. Many historic buildings were destroyed, and others, including the grand <a href="/wiki/Exeter_Cathedral" id="w">Cathedral of St Peter</a> in the heart of the city, were damaged. </p>
<p>Large areas of the city were rebuilt in the 1950s, when little attempt was made to preserve Exeter&#39;s ancient heritage. Damaged buildings were generally demolished rather than restored, and even the street plan was altered in an attempt to improve traffic circulation. The post-war buildings are generally perceived as being of little architectural merit, unlike many of those that they replaced, such as Bedford Circus and a section of the ancient city wall. </p>
<p>Despite some local opposition,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> the <a href="/wiki/Princesshay" id="w">Princesshay</a> shopping centre has been redeveloped between the Cathedral Close and the High Street.

<p>Previously regarded as second only to <a href="/wiki/Bath%2C_Somerset" id="w">Bath</a> as an architectural site in southern England, since the 1942 bombing and subsequent reconstruction Exeter has been a city with some beautiful buildings rather than a beautiful city.

<li>The Guildhall, the oldest municipal building in England still in use.</li>
<li>The Guild of Tuckers and Weavers, a fine old building that is still used for smart functions.</li>
<li>The Custom House in the attractive Quay area, which is the oldest brick building surviving in the city.</li>
<li>St Nicholas Priory in Mint Lane.</li>
<li>A number of medieval churches including St Mary Steps which has an elaborate clock.</li>
<li>&#34;The House That Moved&#34;, a 14th century Tudor building, earned its name in 1961 when it was moved from its original location on the corner of Edmund Street in order for a new road to be built in its place.

The <i><a href="/wiki/Exeter_Book" id="w">Exeter Book</a></i>, an original manuscript and one of the most important documents in Anglo-Saxon literature, is kept in the vaults of Exeter Cathedral. The Exeter Book dates back to the 10th century and is one of four manuscripts that between them contain virtually all the surviving poetry in <a href="/wiki/Old_English_language" id="w">Old English</a>. It includes most of the more highly regarded shorter poems, some religious pieces, and a series of <a href="/wiki/Riddle" id="w">riddles</a>, a handful of which are famously lewd. Some of the riddles are inscribed on a highly polished steel obelisk in the high street, placed on <a href="/wiki/30_March" id="w">30 March</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>.</p>

There are also two amateur theatre buildings with associated companies. The <a href="/wiki/Barnfield_Theatre" id="w">Barnfield Theatre</a>, in the city centre, was converted in 1972 from The Barnfield Hall which was built towards the end of the 19th century by Exeter Literary Society. The theatre is a charity and is used as a venue for amateur and professional theatrical companies. In January 2007 it received £200,000, about the same as the original cost to build it, to refurbish its interior.</p>

<li>The <a href="/wiki/University_of_Exeter" id="w">University of Exeter</a> has two campuses in the city, both notable for their attractive parkland. It is one of the largest employers in the city.</li>

<li>For about 30 years the city of Exeter operated a <a href="/wiki/Maintained_school" id="w">maintained school</a> system in which the divisions between phases came at different ages from most of the United Kingdom, with First, Middle and High rather than Infant, Junior and Secondary schools, so that children transferred between schools at age (about) 8 and 12 rather than 7 and 11. From 2005, however, it has adopted the more usual pattern, because of the pressures of the UK <a href="/wiki/National_Curriculum" id="w">National Curriculum</a>.</li></ul>
<p>The changeover back from the structure led to a city wide, PFI funded, rebuilding program for the High Schools and led to the changing of names for some schools. Following the reorganisation there are 25 Primary schools, 4 Referral Schools, 3 Special Schools and 5 Secondary Schools within Exeter. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.devon.gov.uk/schoolslist/asp/aschoollist.asp" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.devon.gov.uk/schoolslist/asp/aschoollist.asp">http://www.devon.gov.uk/schoolslist/asp/aschoollist.asp</a>.

<a id="Exeter_Canal" name="Exeter_Canal"></a><h2>Exeter Canal</h2>
<p>{{main}}
At the start of the city&#39;s history the river Exe was tidal and navigable up to the city walls enabling it to be a busy port.  
In the 1200s, the Countess of Devon, Isabella de Fortibus, built a <a href="/wiki/Weir" id="w">weir</a> across the river to prevent trade in the city (the &#34;Countess Weir&#34; is still there today). In 1290, trade with Exeter&#39;s port was restored, only to be blocked by a new weir in 1317, built by the then <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Devon" id="w">Earl of Devon</a>, who also built a quay at Topsham. Because of the blockages on the river, boats were forced to unload at <a href="/wiki/Topsham" id="w">Topsham</a> and the earls were able to exact large tolls to transport goods to Exeter.</p>
<p>In 1563, Exeter traders employed John Trew of <a href="/wiki/Glamorgan" id="w">Glamorgan</a> to build a canal to bypass the weirs and rejoin the <a href="/wiki/River_Exe" id="w">River Exe</a> in the centre of the city where a quay would be built. The <a href="/wiki/Exeter_Canal" id="w">new canal</a> had three locks with vertical gates &#8212; the first ever pound locks to be built in Britain. Over the following centuries, the canal was extended and deepened to allow greater numbers and sizes of vessels access to the city but demand for access declined with the end of the wool trade in the early nineteenth century. The weir that maintains the water level in the quay is eponymously named &#39;Trew&#39;s Weir&#39;.</p>
<p>There were many notable failures to connect Exeter and the southwest to the national canal and rail networks: The <a href="/wiki/Grand_Western_Canal" id="w">Grand Western Canal</a> linking Exeter to <a href="/wiki/Bristol" id="w">Bristol</a> (1796) was never completed; The <a href="/wiki/Bristol_%26amp%3B_Exeter_Railway" id="w">Bristol &#38; Exeter Railway</a> link to the canal basin was postponed in 1832 and 1844; The <a href="/wiki/South_Devon_Railway" id="w">South Devon Railway</a> ran services to the canal from 1867, but by this time the canal was too small to attract the sizeable oceangoing vessels. Use of the canal has declined gradually ever since.</p>
<p>In 1972 the <i>Esso Jersey</i> left the canal basin, carrying oil to its terminal. This was the last commercial vessel to leave the canal basin and in 1997 the <i>Countess Weir</i>, a sludge tanker, ceased to operate on the canal, the final commercial vessel to do so.</p>
<p>The quay area has been subject to redevelopment over recent years and is continuing to be converted to wider recreational use. The canal basin itself is popular for a range of watersports.</p>
