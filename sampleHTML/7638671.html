<b>Tropical Storm Dean</b> was a moderate tropical storm that affected at least twelve islands along its path from the tropical <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> to east of <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Canada" id="w">Atlantic Canada</a>. Dean developed from a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_22" id="w">August 22</a> over the <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Antilles" id="w">Lesser Antilles</a>, and was initially predicted to intensify further to reach hurricane status. However, strong <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a> quickly weakened Dean to cause it to dissipate on <a href="/wiki/August_23" id="w">August 23</a>. The remnants turned northward, and redeveloped on <a href="/wiki/August_26" id="w">August 26</a> to the north of <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a>. Located over warm waters and in an area of favorable conditions, Dean steadily strengthened while moving to the northeast, and peaked just below hurricane status on <a href="/wiki/August_27" id="w">August 27</a> about 465&#160;miles (750&#160;km) southwest of <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)" id="w">Newfoundland</a>. The storm subsequently weakened over cooler waters, and became <a href="/wiki/Extratropical" id="w">extratropical</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_28" id="w">August 28</a>.</p>
<p>The precursor tropical wave dropped heavy rainfall and produced moderate winds throughout the <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Antilles" id="w">Lesser Antilles</a>, though no serious damage was reported. In <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico" id="w">Puerto Rico</a>, rainfall of up to 12.7&#160;inches (322&#160;mm) produced widespread flooding across the island. Thousands were left without power or water, and two houses lost their roofs from the storm. The passage of Dean resulted in $7.7&#160;million (2001&#160;USD, $8.1&#160;million 2006&#160;&#160;USD) in damage in Puerto Rico. The storm produced light to moderate rainfall in <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a> and later in <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)" id="w">Newfoundland</a>, though no damage was reported.</p>

A large tropical wave with minimal convection moved off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a> near <a href="/wiki/Dakar" id="w">Dakar</a> between <a href="/wiki/August_14" id="w">August 14</a> and <a href="/wiki/August_15" id="w">August 15</a>. It moved westward, and gradually developed thunderstorms across the wave axis.<sup id="_ref-tcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/August_21" id="w">August 21</a>, while located about 450&#160;miles (725&#160;km) east of the <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Antilles" id="w">Lesser Antilles</a>, convection increased further within the system, though unfavorable upper-level <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a> prevented rapid development.<sup id="_ref-aug22two_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aug22two" title="">[2]</a></sup> It continued to become better organized, and though a <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Hunters" id="w">Reconnaissance flight</a> into the system reported strong winds, it lacked a surface circulation. Late on August 21 the wave passed through the northern Lesser Antilles,<sup id="_ref-tcr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> and subsequent to a decrease in wind shear the system became much better organized on <a href="/wiki/August_22" id="w">August 22</a>.<sup id="_ref-aug21st_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aug21st" title="">[3]</a></sup> A surface circulation formed, and the system developed into Tropical Storm Dean on <a href="/wiki/August_22" id="w">August 22</a> near <a href="/wiki/Saint_Croix%2C_U.S._Virgin_Islands" id="w">Saint Croix</a>. Dean was upgraded directly to a tropical storm due to the presence of 50&#160;mph (80&#160;km/h) winds in the storm.<sup id="_ref-tcr_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Reconnaissance Aircraft and surface reports confirmed the existence of a circulation. Dean moved northwestward at 22&#160;mph (35&#160;km/h), under the influence of the <a href="/wiki/Anticyclone" id="w">Bermuda High</a> to its northeast. The storm strengthened slightly to reach winds of 60&#160;mph (95&#160;km/h) later on <a href="/wiki/August_22" id="w">August 22</a>, though the circulation was exposed on the western edge of the convection due to the storm&#39;s quick forward motion and persistent <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a>. Initial forecasts predicted the shear to decrease, allowing Dean to attain hurricane status with winds of over 80&#160;mph (130&#160;km/h).<sup id="_ref-dean1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dean1" title="">[4]</a></sup> However, an upper-level <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">trough</a> produced an increase of shear over the storm, and by <a href="/wiki/August_23" id="w">August 23</a> Dean weakened to a tropical depression. Hours later, the circulation dissipated, and Dean degenerated into a tropical wave to the east of the <a href="/wiki/Bahamas" id="w">Bahamas</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> Regeneration was considered unlikely at the time.<sup id="_ref-beven5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beven5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The remnants of Dean turned to the north, and became embedded within a large mid-level trough off the <a href="/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States" id="w">East Coast of the United States</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> Convection increased around the system early on <a href="/wiki/August_24" id="w">August 24</a>.<sup id="_ref-franklinaug23_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-franklinaug23" title="">[6]</a></sup> The system became better organized, with indications of a broad surface circulation forming about 400&#160;miles (645&#160;km) west-southwest of <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a>.<sup id="_ref-bevenaug24_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bevenaug24" title="">[7]</a></sup> However, a reconnaissance flight into the remnants of Dean reported a broad <a href="/wiki/Low_pressure_area" id="w">low pressure area</a> with the strongest winds and convection located far from the area of minimum pressure, indicating it had some non-<a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">tropical characteristics</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> The weak disturbance passed to the west of Bermuda early on <a href="/wiki/August_25" id="w">August 25</a>, and subsequently began to drift to the northeast. The remnants of Dean produced convection near its developing circulation, and on <a href="/wiki/August_26" id="w">August 26</a>, while located 220&#160;miles (350&#160;km) north of Bermuda the system organized sufficiently enough to be re-classified a tropical depression.<sup id="_ref-tcr_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> Operationally, the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> did not re-initiate advisories until fifteen hours later.<sup id="_ref-dean6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dean6" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

The depression continued to the northeast, and re-strengthened into Tropical Storm Dean early on <a href="/wiki/August_27" id="w">August 27</a> while located 580 miles (930 km) south of <a href="/wiki/Halifax_Regional_Municipality" id="w">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> The convection became better organized, and Dean steadily strengthened as it tracked northeastward. A ship near the center of Dean confirmed the storm re-developed.<sup id="_ref-dean6_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dean6" title="">[8]</a></sup> The convection near the center greatly organized, and an <a href="/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)" id="w">eye feature</a> began to develop.<sup id="_ref-stewart7_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stewart7" title="">[9]</a></sup> Remaining over warm waters, Dean continued to strengthen and reached peak winds of 70&#160;mph (110&#160;km/h) late on the 27th while located about 465&#160;miles (750&#160;km) southwest of <a href="/wiki/Cape_Race" id="w">Cape Race</a>, <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador" id="w">Newfoundland</a>.<sup id="_ref-stewart8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stewart8" title="">[10]</a></sup> The eye feature failed to develop further, and after maintaining its peak intensity for 12 hours Dean weakened over progressively cooler waters.<sup id="_ref-tcr_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> The convection quickly diminished,<sup id="_ref-beven10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beven10" title="">[11]</a></sup> and on <a href="/wiki/August_28" id="w">August 28</a> Dean became <a href="/wiki/Extratropical" id="w">extratropical</a> while located 145&#160;miles (235&#160;km) east-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland.

<p>About a day before Dean developed, the National Hurricane Center advised interests in the northern and central <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Antilles" id="w">Lesser Antilles</a> to monitor the progress of the storm.<sup id="_ref-aug22two_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aug22two" title="">[2]</a></sup> Routine statements issued by the National Hurricane Center warned for the possibility of strong winds and heavy rains. However, because Dean formed after it passed the islands, no <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" id="w">tropical cyclone warnings or watches</a> were issued.<sup id="_ref-tcr_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> The precursor tropical wave dropped moderate to heavy rainfall throughout the Lesser Antilles, including 1.5&#160;inches (38&#160;mm) in <a href="/wiki/Nevis" id="w">Nevis</a>.<sup id="_ref-unofnevis_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-unofnevis" title="">[12]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/Antigua" id="w">Antigua</a>, the system produced sustained winds of 30 to 35&#160;mph (48 to 56&#160;km/h), with gusts of over 50&#160;mph (80&#160;km/h) on higher terrain.<sup id="_ref-unofantigua_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-unofantigua" title="">[13]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/Saba" id="w">Saba</a>, the wave dropped around 1&#160;inch (25&#160;mm) of rain, and due to the threat for mudslides several schools were closed early. Officials at the <a href="/wiki/Juancho_E._Yrausquin_Airport" id="w">Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport</a> cancelled several flights due to the system.

The precursor disturbance to Tropical Storm Dean produced 1.07&#160;inches (27&#160;mm) of rain in <a href="/wiki/Saint_Thomas%2C_U.S._Virgin_Islands" id="w">Saint Thomas</a>, where winds reached 40&#160;mph (64&#160;km/h) with gusts to 48&#160;mph (77&#160;km/h).<sup id="_ref-tcr_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> 6 to 8&#160;foot (1.8 to 2.4&#160;m) seas caused disruptions in the coastal waters of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Virgin_Islands" id="w">United States Virgin Islands</a>.<sup id="_ref-stthomasunof_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stthomasunof" title="">[18]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/Saint_Croix%2C_U.S._Virgin_Islands" id="w">Saint Croix</a>, the system produced 0.49&#160;inches (12&#160;mm) of rain and peak wind gusts of 47&#160;mph (76&#160;km/h). There, minor flooding was reported. Moderate wind gusts downed small trees and branches in Saint Croix and <a href="/wiki/Saint_John%2C_U.S._Virgin_Islands" id="w">Saint John</a>, and some roads were damaged in Saint John, as well. Heavy rains and gusty winds caused power outages throughout the U.S. Virgin Islands. The passage of Tropical Storm Dean resulted in minor damage totaling to $20,000 (2001&#160;USD, $23,000 2006&#160;USD).<sup id="_ref-usvincdc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-usvincdc" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Tropical Storm Dean dropped heavy rainfall across <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico" id="w">Puerto Rico</a>, peaking at 12.7&#160;inches (322&#160;mm) in <a href="/wiki/Salinas%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Salinas</a>. Winds were generally light across the island. The passage of Dean resulted in widespread flooding in eastern and southern Puerto Rico, collapsing two bridges and one road. Several highways were under water, and one car was swept away by the floodwaters. The four inside the vehicle were later rescued and unharmed. Throughout the island, about 1,320&#160;houses were flooded, and two houses experienced collapsed roofs.
