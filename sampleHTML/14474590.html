<p>The <b>Institute of Transportation Studies</b> (ITS) at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley" id="w">University of California, Berkeley</a>, is an international center for research, education, and scholarship in the field of transportation. UC Berkeley faculty members, staff researchers, and graduate students comprise this multidisciplinary institute of more than 300 people, primarily supported by research funds. The UC Berkeley ITS is an Organized Research Unit with nine affiliated organizations and an eight-member advisory council. It is part of multi-campus research unit, the University of California Institute of Transportation Studies, which includes <a href="/wiki/UC_Berkeley" id="w">UC Berkeley</a> ITS, <a href="/wiki/UC_Davis" id="w">UC Davis</a> ITS, and <a href="/wiki/UCLA" id="w">UCLA</a> ITS.</p>
<p>Two UC Berkeley academic departments, Civil and Environmental Engineering in the College of Engineering and City and Regional Planning in the College of Environmental Design, offer graduate and undergraduate courses in transportation engineering, planning, policy, economics, and technology, and confer degrees. ITS, an organized research unit (ORU),  provides a means for those students to conduct research. Advisory council members are from the arenas of transportation, government, metropolitan planning, and academia.</p>
<p>The Institute of Transportation Studies was created at UC Berkeley in 1948 by the California state legislature to support the rebuilding of the U.S transportation system following World War II. Its original mission was &#34;to conduct research and provide instruction to a new generation of transportation professionals&#34; and it still serves that mission today. Michael Cassidy, Ph.D., is the Acting Director.</p>
