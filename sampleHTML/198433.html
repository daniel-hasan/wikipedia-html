<p><b><i>GoldenEye</i></b>, released in <a href="/wiki/1995_in_film" id="w">1995</a>, is the seventeenth <a href="/wiki/Spy_film" id="w">spy film</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/James_Bond" id="w">James Bond</a> <a href="/wiki/James_Bond_(films)" id="w">series</a>, and the first to star <a href="/wiki/Pierce_Brosnan" id="w">Pierce Brosnan</a> as the <a href="/wiki/Fictional_character" id="w">fictional</a> <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" id="w">MI6</a> agent <a href="/wiki/James_Bond_(character)" id="w">James Bond</a>. Unlike previous James Bond films, it was not related to the works of novelist <a href="/wiki/Ian_Fleming" id="w">Ian Fleming</a>,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>  although the name &#34;GoldenEye&#34; was taken from his estate in <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" id="w">Jamaica</a>. The original story was conceived and written by <a href="/wiki/Michael_France" id="w">Michael France</a>, with later collaboration by several other writers, and was directed by <a href="/wiki/Martin_Campbell" id="w">Martin Campbell</a>. In the film, Bond fights to prevent an arms syndicate from using the GoldenEye satellite weapon against <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> in order to cause a global financial meltdown.</p>
<p><i>GoldenEye</i> was released in 1995 after legal disputes forced a six-year hiatus in the series, during which <a href="/wiki/Timothy_Dalton" id="w">Timothy Dalton</a> resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" id="w">M</a> was also recast (last played by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Brown_(actor)" id="w">Robert Brown</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Licence_to_Kill" id="w">Licence to Kill</a></i>) with actress <a href="/wiki/Judi_Dench" id="w">Judi Dench</a>, becoming the first female to portray the character. <i>GoldenEye</i> was the first Bond film made after the downfall of the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> and the end of the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" id="w">Cold War</a>, which provided a background for the plot.</p>
<p>The film was lauded by most critics and performed well at the box office, considerably better than Dalton&#39;s films, without taking inflation into account.<sup id="_ref-nos_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nos" title="">[2]</a></sup> Some critics viewed the film as a modernisation of the series, and felt Brosnan was a definite improvement over his predecessor.<sup id="_ref-QNetwork_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-QNetwork" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-variety_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-variety" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> It also received two <a href="/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts" id="w">BAFTA</a> nominations &#8211; &#34;Best Achievement in Special Effects&#34; and &#34;Best Sound&#34;.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Nine years later, Bond arrives in <a href="/wiki/Monte_Carlo" id="w">Monte Carlo</a> to follow Xenia Onatopp, a suspected member of the <a href="/wiki/Janus" id="w">Janus</a> crime syndicate. The next day, she and Ourumov (now a Russian general) steal a French Tiger helicopter and fly it to a bunker in <a href="/wiki/Severnaya" id="w">Severnaya</a>, where they massacre the staff and steal the control disk for the <b>GoldenEye</b> satellite weapon. The two program Goldeneye to target and destroy the complex with an <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse" id="w">electromagnetic pulse</a>, while they escape with programmer Boris Grishenko, another Janus operative. <a href="/wiki/Natalya_Simonova" id="w">Natalya Simonova</a>, the lone survivor and witness to the massacre, later escapes from the ruins and arranges to meet Grishenko in <a href="/wiki/St._Petersburg" id="w">St. Petersburg</a>, where he betrays her to Janus agents.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" id="w">M</a> assigns Bond to investigate the attack, and he flies to St. Petersburg to meet CIA agent <a href="/wiki/Jack_Wade" id="w">Jack Wade</a>, who drives him to meet <a href="/wiki/Valentin_Zukovsky#Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky" id="w">Valentin Zukovsky</a>, a local <a href="/wiki/Russian_Mafia" id="w">Russian Mafia</a> head. Zukovsky arranges a meeting between Bond and Janus, who reveals himself as Trevelyan. A <a href="/wiki/Betrayal_of_the_Cossacks" id="w">Lienz Cossac</a>, Trevelyan faked his death at Archangelsk and vows revenge against Britain for their involvement in his family&#39;s death. Trevelyan captures Bond and ties him up with Simonova in the Tiger helicopter, now programmed to self-destruct, which the two narrowly escape using its ejection system. Bond and Simonova are immediately arrested by the Russian police and interrogated by the Minister of Defence, <a href="/wiki/Dmitri_Mishkin" id="w">Dmitri Mishkin</a>. Just as Simonova reveals Ourumov&#39;s involvement in the massacre at Severnaya, Ourumov bursts into the room, shooting Mishkin and dragging Simonova into a waiting car.<a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:GE-BondandSimonovainCuba.jpg" title="[[James Bond]] and [[Natalya Simonova]] in Cuba."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE-BondandSimonovainCuba.jpg" alt="[[James Bond]] and [[Natalya Simonova]] in Cuba." title="[[James Bond]] and [[Natalya Simonova]] in Cuba." class="location-right type-thumb" />

<div class="thumbcaption"><a href="/wiki/James_Bond" id="w">James Bond</a> and <a href="/wiki/Natalya_Simonova" id="w">Natalya Simonova</a> in Cuba.</div> Bond steals a <a href="/wiki/T-55" id="w">T-55</a> tank and audaciously pursues Ourumov through St. Petersburg to Janus&#39; train, where he kills Ourumov as Trevelyan escapes, locking Bond in the train with Simonova. As the train&#39;s self-destruct countdown begins, Bond slices through the floor with his laser watch while Simonova locates Grishenko&#39;s satellite dish in Cuba. The two escape just before the train explodes.</p>
<p>In Cuba, Bond and Simonova fly a plane over the jungle before they are shot down. As they stumble out of the wreckage, Onatopp rappels down from a helicopter and attacks, knocking out Simonova and torturing an already enfeebled Bond, who resists and narrowly kills her. Minutes later, he and Simonova watch a lake being drained of its water, uncovering Grishenko&#39;s satellite dish. They infiltrate the control station, where Bond is captured by Trevelyan, who reveals his plan of stealing money from the <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_England" id="w">Bank of England</a> before destroying it with the GoldenEye, concealing the theft and destroying England&#39;s economy. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, an unnoticed Simonova programs the satellite to initiate <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_reentry" id="w">atmospheric reentry</a> and destroy itself. As Trevelyan captures Simonova and orders Grishenko to save the satellite, Bond triggers an explosion with his <a href="/wiki/Parker_Jotter" id="w">Parker Jotter</a> pen grenade and escapes to the antenna cradle with Simonova, followed by Trevelyan. Bond sabotages the antenna, preventing Grishenko from regaining control of the satellite, before turning and facing Trevelyan. In the ensuing fight, Bond shoves Trevelyan off the antenna and into the dish hundreds of feet below, before escaping aboard a helicopter commandeered by Simonova. The cradle malfunctions and collapses, crushing Trevelyan and rupturing <a href="/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen" id="w">liquid nitrogen</a> tanks in the station that freeze Grishenko to death. Meanwhile on the surface, while finding solace in each others arms, Bond and Simonova are rescued by Wade and his platoon of U.S. Marines.</p>

<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h1>Production</h1>
<p>The preceding Bond film, <i><a href="/wiki/Licence_to_Kill" id="w">Licence to Kill</a></i>, had underperformed at the American box office.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Also, in 1989, MGM/UA was sold to the Australian based broadcasting group Quintex, who wanted to merge the company with <a href="/wiki/Path%C3%A9" id="w">Pathé</a>. Danjaq, the Swiss based parent company of EON, sued <a href="/wiki/MGM/UA" id="w">MGM/UA</a> because the Bond back catalogue was being licensed to Pathé, who intended to broadcast the Bond series on television in several countries across the world without the approval of Danjaq.<sup id="_ref-Production notes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Production notes" title="">[8]</a></sup> These legal disputes delayed the film for several years.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>While the legal disputes went on, <a href="/wiki/Timothy_Dalton" id="w">Timothy Dalton</a> was still expected to play Bond in the new film, as he had originally signed up for a three-film contract. In an interview in 1993, Dalton said that Michael France was writing the story for the film, which was due to begin production in January or February 1994.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> However, the deadline was not met, and in April 1994, Dalton officially abdicated from the role.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> To replace Dalton, the producers cast Pierce Brosnan, who had been prevented from taking over the role from <a href="/wiki/Roger_Moore" id="w">Roger Moore</a> in 1985 because of his contract with <i><a href="/wiki/Remington_Steele" id="w">Remington Steele</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Judi Dench was cast as M, thus making <i>GoldenEye</i> the first film of the series featuring a female M. The decision is widely believed to be inspired by <a href="/wiki/Stella_Rimington" id="w">Stella Rimington</a> becoming head of <a href="/wiki/MI5" id="w">MI5</a> in 1992.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>GoldenEye</i> was produced by <a href="/wiki/Albert_R._Broccoli" id="w">Albert R. Broccoli</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/EON_Productions" id="w">EON Productions</a>. With Albert Broccoli&#39;s health deteriorating (he died seven months after the film&#39;s release), his daughter <a href="/wiki/Barbara_Broccoli" id="w">Barbara Broccoli</a> described him as taking &#34;a bit of a back seat&#34; in the production of the film, but still having a lot of influence.<sup id="_ref-ashton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ashton" title="">[17]</a></sup> In his stead, Barbara and <a href="/wiki/Michael_G._Wilson" id="w">Michael G. Wilson</a> took the lead roles in production. The producers then chose <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealander</a> <a href="/wiki/Martin_Campbell" id="w">Martin Campbell</a> as the director. Brosnan later described Campbell as &#34;warrior-like in his take on the piece&#34; and that &#34;there was a huge passion there on both our parts&#34;.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> Campbell would go on to direct <a href="/wiki/Casino_Royale_(2006_film)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Casino Royale&#39;&#39;</a> in 2006. The producers also chose not to use  <a href="/wiki/Richard_Maibaum" id="w">Richard Maibaum</a>, long-time writer for the series.<sup id="_ref-Production notes_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Production notes" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> After Michael France wrote the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine was brought in to rewrite it.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Caine kept many of France&#39;s ideas but added the prologue prior to the credits. Kevin Wade polished the script and <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Feirstein" id="w">Bruce Feirstein</a> added the finishing touches.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement he felt was unfair,<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> particularly as he believed the additions made were not an improvement on his original version.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created. </p>
<p>While the story was not based on a work by Ian Fleming, the title <i>GoldenEye</i> traces its origins to the name of Fleming&#39;s Jamaican estate where he wrote the Bond novels. Fleming gave a number of origins for the name of his estate, including <a href="/wiki/Carson_McCullers" id="w">Carson McCullers</a>&#39; <i><a href="/wiki/Reflections_in_a_Golden_Eye" id="w">Reflections in a Golden Eye</a></i><sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Operation_Goldeneye" id="w">Operation Goldeneye</a>, a contingency plan Fleming himself developed during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> in case of a <a href="/wiki/Nazi" id="w">Nazi</a> invasion through <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Since <i>Licence to Kill</i>, the world had changed drastically. <i>GoldenEye</i> was the first James Bond film to be produced since the fall of the <a href="/wiki/Berlin_Wall" id="w">Berlin Wall</a> and the collapse of the Soviet Union. This cast doubt over whether James Bond was still relevant in the modern world, as many of the previous films pitted him against Soviet villains trying to take advantage of the Cold War.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Much of the film industry felt that it would be &#34;futile&#34; to make a comeback for the Bond series, and that it was best left as &#34;an icon of the past&#34;<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> However, when released, the film was viewed as a successful revivification and it effectively adapted the series for the 1990s.<sup id="_ref-variety_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-variety" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Premiere & Press_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Premiere & Press" title="">[29]</a></sup> One of <i>GoldenEye&#39;s</i> more modern aspects was the casting of a female as M, the first James Bond film to do so. In the film, the new M quickly establishes her authority, remarking that Bond is a &#34;sexist, misogynist dinosaur&#34; and a &#34;relic of the Cold War&#34;. This is an early indication that Bond is portrayed as far less tempestuous than Timothy Dalton&#39;s Bond from 1989.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>

<i>GoldenEye</i> was the second and final Bond film to be adapted to a novel by novelist <a href="/wiki/John_Gardner_(thriller_writer)" id="w">John Gardner</a>, and was to be his penultimate Bond novel. The book closely follows the film&#39;s storyline, but Gardner added a violent sequence prior to the opening bungee jump in which Bond kills a group of Russian guards, a change that the video game <i>GoldenEye 007</i> retained.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup></p>
