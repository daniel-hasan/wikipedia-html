<p><b>Lymeswold cheese</b> was an <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> <a href="/wiki/Cheese" id="w">cheese</a> variety. Many English cheeses are named after regions, however Lymeswold is not the name of a place, although it may have been derived from the place name <a href="/wiki/Wymeswold" id="w">Wymeswold</a>. The cheese was a soft, mild blue cheese, much like <a href="/wiki/Brie_cheese" id="w">Brie</a>, and was inspired by <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a> cheeses. It was similar to non-branded cheeses sold as <a href="/wiki/Blue_Brie" id="w">Blue Brie</a>. For the export market, the cheese was branded <b>Westminster Blue</b>, because people had difficulty pronouncing Lymeswold.</p>
<a id="Origins" name="Origins"></a><h1>Origins</h1>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1979" id="w">1979</a> the <a href="/wiki/Milk_Marketing_Board" id="w">Milk Marketing Board</a> initiated negotiations with the large dairy firm <a href="/wiki/Unigate" id="w">Unigate</a> that led in <a href="/wiki/1981" id="w">1981</a> to the restructuring of its processing and marketing activities under the <a href="/wiki/Dairy_Crest" id="w">Dairy Crest</a> brand to use surplus milk production to make dairy products.  The initiatives that followed included the launch in <a href="/wiki/1982" id="w">1982</a> of Lymeswold cheese. The cheese was at first produced at Cannington creamery in Somerset where the manager at the time was Mr R.P. Savage. The cheese&#39;s creation was hailed by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Walker%2C_Baron_Walker_of_Worcester" id="w">Peter Walker</a>, then <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_Agriculture%2C_Fisheries_and_Food" id="w">Agriculture Minister</a>, who said it would improve the balance of payments by replacing imports and becoming &#34;one of our most successful cheese exports.&#34;</p>

<p>Following heavy launch promotion and a very successful <a href="/wiki/Brand" id="w">branding</a> exercise, initial demand for Lymeswold outstripped supply. It has been suggested that the Board then released maturing stocks before they were ready, which gave the cheese a reputation for poor quality. Certainly the initial success of the cheese did not turn into steady long-term sales. It was later subjected to strong competition from <a href="/wiki/Cambozola" id="w">Cambozola</a>, a German cheese.  In the end, the cheese ceased production in <a href="/wiki/1992" id="w">1992</a>. <a href="/wiki/Dairy_Crest" id="w">Dairy Crest</a> said at the time that it &#34;could not sustain demand.&#34; <a href="/wiki/John_Withley" id="w">John Withley</a>, then the <a href="/wiki/Restaurant" id="w">restaurant</a> <a href="/wiki/Critic" id="w">critic</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Daily_Telegraph" id="w">Daily Telegraph</a>, welcomed the news with &#34;unfettered joy,&#34; saying it had always been &#34;an artificial cheese.&#34;</p>

<p>The name Lymeswold has lived on as one of many running jokes in <a href="/wiki/Private_Eye" id="w">Private Eye</a>. As it is well known that Lymeswold is not a real location, the word is also sometimes used for the name of a generic fictitious English place.</p>
