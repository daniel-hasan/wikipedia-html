<b><i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i></b><i>; or, Life Among the Lowly</i> is an anti-<a href="/wiki/Slavery" id="w">slavery</a> novel by <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> author <a href="/wiki/Harriet_Beecher_Stowe" id="w">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>. Published in 1852, the novel had a profound effect on attitudes toward <a href="/wiki/African_American" id="w">African Americans</a> and <a href="/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_the_United_States" id="w">slavery in the United States</a>, so much so in the latter case that the novel intensified the <a href="/wiki/Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War" id="w">sectional conflict</a> leading to the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Stowe, a <a href="/wiki/Connecticut" id="w">Connecticut</a>-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an active <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism" id="w">abolitionist</a>, focused the novel on the character of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering Black slave around whom the stories of other characters—both fellow slaves and slave owners—revolve. The <a href="/wiki/Sentimental_novel" id="w">sentimental novel</a> depicts the cruel reality of slavery while also asserting that <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christian</a> love can overcome something as destructive as enslavement of fellow human beings.<sup id="_ref-Sparknotes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sparknotes" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CompleteIdiot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CompleteIdiot" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Domestic Abolitionism_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Domestic Abolitionism" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> was the best-selling novel of the 19th century<sup id="_ref-GailSmith_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GailSmith" title="">[5]</a></sup> (and the second best-selling book of that century, following the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible</a>)<sup id="_ref-bookrags_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bookrags" title="">[6]</a></sup> and is credited with helping fuel the abolitionist cause in the 1850s.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> In the first year after it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold in the United States alone. The book&#39;s impact was so great that when <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" id="w">Abraham Lincoln</a> met Stowe at the start of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>, Lincoln is often quoted as having declared, &#34;So this is the little lady who made this big war.&#34;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The book, and even more the <a href="/wiki/Play" id="w">plays</a> it inspired, also helped create a number of stereotypes about <a href="/wiki/Black_people" id="w">Blacks</a>,<sup id="_ref-Husler_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Husler" title="">[9]</a></sup> many of which endure to this day. These include the affectionate, dark-skinned <a href="/wiki/Mammy_archetype" id="w">mammy</a>; the <a href="/wiki/Pickaninny" id="w">Pickaninny</a> stereotype of black children; and the <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tom" id="w">Uncle Tom</a>, or dutiful, long-suffering servant faithful to his white master or mistress. In recent years, the negative associations with <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> have, to an extent, overshadowed the historical impact of the book as a &#34;vital antislavery tool.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Africana_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Africana" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Sources_for_the_novel" name="Sources_for_the_novel"></a><h1> Sources for the novel </h1>

<p>Stowe, a <a href="/wiki/Connecticut" id="w">Connecticut</a>-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an active <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism" id="w">abolitionist</a>, wrote the novel as a response to the 1850 passage of the second <a href="/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Law_of_1850" id="w">Fugitive Slave Act</a> (which punished those who aided runaway slaves and diminished the rights of fugitives as well as freed Blacks). Much of the book was composed in <a href="/wiki/Brunswick%2C_Maine" id="w">Brunswick</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maine" id="w">Maine</a>, where her husband, Calvin Stowe, taught at his alma mater <a href="/wiki/Bowdoin_College" id="w">Bowdoin College</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>Stowe was partly inspired to create <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> by the autobiography of <a href="/wiki/Josiah_Henson" id="w">Josiah Henson</a>, a black man who lived and worked on a 3,700-acre (14.8 km²) tobacco plantation in <a href="/wiki/North_Bethesda%2C_Maryland" id="w">North Bethesda, Maryland</a> owned by Isaac Riley.<sup id="_ref-Logue_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Logue" title="">[12]</a></sup> Henson escaped slavery in 1830 by fleeing to the <a href="/wiki/Upper_Canada" id="w">Province of Upper Canada</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Ontario" id="w">Ontario</a>), where he helped other fugitive slaves arrive and become self-sufficient, and where he wrote his memoirs. Harriet Beecher Stowe evidently acknowledged that Henson&#39;s writings inspired <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> When Stowe&#39;s book became famous, Henson republished his memoirs as <i>The Memoirs of Uncle Tom</i>, and traveled extensively in America and Europe.<sup id="_ref-Logue_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Logue" title="">[12]</a></sup> Stowe&#39;s novel lent its name to Henson&#39;s home—Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin Historic Site, near <a href="/wiki/Dresden%2C_Ontario" id="w">Dresden, Ontario</a>—which since the 1940s has been a museum. The actual <a href="/wiki/Josiah_Henson#The Henson Cabin.E2.80.94Maryland" id="w">cabin</a> Henson lived in while a slave still exists in Montgomery County, Maryland.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States" id="w">American Slavery</a> As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses</i>, a volume co-authored by <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Dwight_Weld" id="w">Theodore Dwight Weld</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Grimk%C3%A9_sisters" id="w">Grimké sisters</a>, is also identified as a source of some of the material.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Stowe also said she based the novel on a number of interviews with escaped slaves during the time when Stowe was living in <a href="/wiki/Cincinnati%2C_Ohio" id="w">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state. In Cincinnati the <a href="/wiki/Underground_Railroad" id="w">Underground Railroad</a> had local abolitionist sympathizers and was active in efforts to help runaway slaves on their escape route from the South.</p>
<p>Stowe mentioned a number of the inspirations and sources for her novel in her 1853 book <i><a href="/wiki/A_Key_to_Uncle_Tom%26%2339%3Bs_Cabin" id="w">A Key to Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</a>.</i> This nonfiction book was written to back up Stowe&#39;s claims about the evils of slavery.<sup id="_ref-UTCKey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UTCKey" title="">[15]</a></sup> However, later research indicated that Stowe did not actually read many of the book&#39;s cited works until after the publication of her novel.<sup id="_ref-UTCKey_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UTCKey" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Publication" name="Publication"></a><h1> Publication </h1>

<p><i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> was first published as a 40-week serial in <i>National Era</i>, an <a href="/wiki/Abolitionist" id="w">abolitionist</a> periodical, starting with the <a href="/wiki/June_5" id="w">June 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1851" id="w">1851</a> issue. Because of the story&#39;s popularity, publisher John Jewett contacted Stowe about turning the serial into a book. While Stowe questioned if anyone would read <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> in book form, she eventually consented to the request.

Convinced the book would be popular, Jewett made the unusual decision (for that time) to have six fullpage illustrations by <a href="/wiki/Hammatt_Billings" id="w">Hammatt Billings</a> engraved for the first printing.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Published in book form on <a href="/wiki/March_20" id="w">March 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1852" id="w">1852</a>, the novel soon sold out its complete print run. A number of other editions were soon printed (including a deluxe edition in 1853, featuring 117 illustrations by Billings).<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the first year of publication, 300,000 copies of <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> were sold. The book eventually became the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century (and the second best-selling book after the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible</a>), with the book being translated into every major language.<sup id="_ref-bookrags_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bookrags" title="">[6]</a></sup> A number of the early editions carried an introduction by <a href="/wiki/James_Sherman_(minister)" id="w">Rev James Sherman</a>, a Congregational minister in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> noted for his abolitionist views.</p>
<p><i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> sold equally well in England, with the first London edition appearing in May, 1852 and selling 200,000 copies.<sup id="_ref-pbs-4p2958_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pbs-4p2958" title="">[18]</a></sup> In a few years over 1.5 million copies of the book were in circulation in England, although most of these were pirated copies (a similar situation occurred in the United States).<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<p>The book opens with a <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" id="w">Kentucky</a> farmer named <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tom%26%2339%3Bs_Cabin#Arthur Shelby" id="w">Arthur Shelby</a> facing the loss of his farm because of debts.

</p>
<p>When Eliza overhears Mr. and Mrs. Shelby discussing plans to sell Tom and Harry, Eliza determines to run away with her son. The novel states that Eliza made this decision not because of physical cruelty, but by her fear of losing her only surviving child (she had already lost two children due to miscarriage). Eliza departs that night, leaving a note of apology to her mistress.</p>
<p>While all of this is happening, Uncle Tom is sold and placed on a <a href="/wiki/Riverboat" id="w">riverboat</a>, which sets sail down the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a>. While on board, Tom meets and befriends a young white girl named <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tom%26%2339%3Bs_Cabin#Eva" id="w">Eva</a>. When Eva falls into the river, Tom saves her. In gratitude, Eva&#39;s father, <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tom%26%2339%3Bs_Cabin#Augustine St. Clare" id="w">Augustine St. Clare</a>, buys Tom from the slave trader and takes him with the family to their home in <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans" id="w">New Orleans</a>. During this time, Tom and Eva begin to relate to one another because of the deep Christian faith they both share.</p>

<p>During Eliza&#39;s escape, she meets up with her husband George Harris, who ran away previously. They decide to attempt to reach Canada. However, they are now being tracked by a slave hunter named Tom Loker. Eventually Loker and his men trap Eliza and her family, causing George to shoot Loker. Worried that Loker may die, Eliza convinces George to bring the slave hunter to a nearby <a href="/wiki/Quaker" id="w">Quaker</a> settlement for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Back in New Orleans, St. Clare debates slavery with his Northern cousin Ophelia who, while opposing slavery, is prejudiced against Black people. St. Clare, however, believes he is not biased, even though he is a slave owner. In an attempt to show Ophelia that her views on Blacks are wrong, St. Clare purchases <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tom%26%2339%3Bs_Cabin#Topsy" id="w">Topsy</a>, a young black slave. St. Clare then asks Ophelia to educate Topsy.</p>
<p>After Tom has lived with the St. Clares for two years, Eva grows very ill. Before she dies she experiences a vision of heaven, which she shares with the people around her. As a result of her death and vision, the other characters resolve to change their lives, with Ophelia promising to throw off her personal prejudices against Blacks, Topsy saying she will better herself, and St. Clare pledging to free Uncle Tom.</p>

</p>
<p>Before St. Clare can follow through on his pledge, he is fatally stabbed while intervening in a fight. His wife reneges on her late husband&#39;s vow and sells Tom at auction to a vicious <a href="/wiki/Plantation" id="w">plantation</a> owner named <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tom%26%2339%3Bs_Cabin#Simon Legree" id="w">Simon Legree</a>. Legree (who is not a native southerner but a transplanted <a href="/wiki/Yankee" id="w">Yankee</a>) takes Tom to rural <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a>, where Tom meets Legree&#39;s other slaves, including Emmeline (whom Legree purchased at the same time). Legree begins to hate Tom when Tom refuses Legree&#39;s order to whip his fellow slave. Tom receives a brutal beating, and Legree resolves to crush Tom&#39;s faith in <a href="/wiki/God" id="w">God</a>. But Tom refuses to stop <a href="/wiki/Reading_(activity)" id="w">reading</a> his <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible</a> and comforting the other slaves as best he can. While at the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another of Legree&#39;s slaves. Cassy was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold; unable to endure the pain of seeing another child sold, she killed her third child.</p>
<p>At this point Tom Loker returns to the story. Loker has changed as the result of being healed by the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have also obtained their freedom after crossing into Canada. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is tested by the hardships of the plantation. However, he has two visions—one of <a href="/wiki/Jesus" id="w">Jesus</a> and one of Eva—which renews his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men become Christians. Very shortly before Tom&#39;s death, George Shelby (Arthur Shelby&#39;s son) arrives to buy Tom’s freedom, but finds he is too late. </p>

<p>On their boat ride to freedom, Cassy and Emmeline meet George Harris&#39; sister and accompany her to Canada. Once there, Cassy discovers that Eliza is her long-lost daughter who was sold as a child. Now that their family is together again, they travel to <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> and eventually <a href="/wiki/Liberia" id="w">Liberia</a>, the African nation created for former American slaves. There they meet Cassy&#39;s long-lost son. George Shelby returns to the Kentucky farm and frees all his slaves. George tells them to remember Tom&#39;s sacrifice and his belief in the true meaning of Christianity.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tom" id="w">Uncle Tom</a>, the titular character, was initially seen as a noble long-suffering Christian slave. In more recent years his name has become an epithet directed towards <a href="/wiki/African-Americans" id="w">African-Americans</a> who are accused of selling out to whites (for more on this, see the <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tom%26%2339%3Bs_Cabin#Creation and popularization of stereotypes" id="w">creation and popularization of stereotypes</a> section). However, Stowe intended Tom to be a &#34;noble hero&#34;<sup id="_ref-NobleHero_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NobleHero" title="">[20]</a></sup>  and praiseworthy person. Throughout the book, far from allowing himself to be exploited, Tom stands up for his beliefs and is grudgingly admired even by his enemies.</p>
<a id="Eliza" name="Eliza"></a><h2>Eliza</h2>
<p>A slave (personal maid to Mrs. Shelby), she escapes to the North with her five-year old son Harry after he is sold to Mr. Haley. Her husband, George, eventually finds Eliza and Harry in <a href="/wiki/Ohio" id="w">Ohio</a>, and emigrates with them to <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, then <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> and finally <a href="/wiki/Liberia" id="w">Liberia</a>.</p>
<p>The character Eliza was inspired by an account given at <a href="/wiki/Lane_Theological_Seminary" id="w">Lane Theological Seminary</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cincinnati%2C_Ohio" id="w">Cincinnati</a> by <a href="/wiki/John_Rankin_(abolitionist)" id="w">John Rankin</a> to Stowe&#39;s husband Calvin, a professor at the school. According to Rankin, in February, 1838 a young slave woman had escaped across the frozen <a href="/wiki/Ohio_River" id="w">Ohio River</a> to the town of <a href="/wiki/Ripley%2C_Ohio" id="w">Ripley</a> with her child in her arms and stayed at his house on her way further north.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Eva" name="Eva"></a><h2>Eva</h2>
<p>Eva, whose real name is Evangeline St. Clare, is the daughter of Augustine St. Clare. Eva enters the narrative when <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tom" id="w">Uncle Tom</a> is traveling via <a href="/wiki/Steamship" id="w">steamship</a> to <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans" id="w">New Orleans</a> to be sold, and he rescues the 5 or 6 year-old girl from drowning. Eva begs her father to buy Tom, and he becomes the head coachman at the St. Clare <a href="/wiki/Plantation" id="w">plantation</a>. He spends most of his time with the angelic Eva, however.</p>
<p>Eva constantly talks about love and forgiveness, even convincing the dour slave girl Topsy that she deserves love.  She even manages to touch the heart of her sour aunt, Ophelia. Some consider Eva to be a prototype of the character archetype known as the <a href="/wiki/Mary_Sue" id="w">Mary Sue</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually Eva falls ill. Before dying, she gives a lock of her hair to each of the slaves, telling them that they must become <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christians</a> so that they may see each other in <a href="/wiki/Heaven" id="w">Heaven</a>. On her deathbed, she convinces her father to free Tom, but because of circumstances the promise never materializes.</p>

<p>A <a href="/wiki/Villain" id="w">villainous</a> and cruel slave owner—a Northerner by birth—whose name has become synonymous with greed.  His goal is to demoralize Tom and break him of his religious faith.</p>
<a id="Topsy" name="Topsy"></a><h2>Topsy</h2>
<p>A &#34;ragamuffin&#34; young slave girl of unknown origin.  When asked if she knows who made her, she professes ignorance of both God and a mother, saying &#34;I s&#39;pect I growed. Don&#39;t think nobody never made me.&#34; She was transformed by Little Eva&#39;s love. Topsy is often seen as the origin of the <a href="/wiki/Pickaninny" id="w">pickaninny</a> stereotype of Black children.</p>
<p>The phrase &#34;growed like Topsy&#34; (later &#34;grew like Topsy&#34;; now somewhat archaic) passed into the English language, originally with the specific meaning of unplanned growth, later sometimes just meaning enormous growth.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Other_characters" name="Other_characters"></a><h1>Other characters</h1>

<p>There are a number of secondary and minor characters in <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i>. Among the more notable are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Arthur Shelby</b>,  Tom&#39;s master in Kentucky. Shelby is characterized as a &#34;kind&#34; slaveowner and a stereotypical Southern gentleman.</li>
<li><b>Emily Shelby</b>, Arthur Shelby&#39;s wife. A deeply religious woman who strives to be a kind and moral influence upon her slaves. She is appalled when her husband sells his slaves with a slave trader. As a woman, she had no legal way to stop this, as <a href="/wiki/Coverture" id="w">all property belonged to her husband</a>.</li>
<li><b>George Shelby</b>, Arthur and Emily&#39;s son. Sees Tom as a &#34;friend&#34; and as the perfect Christian.</li>

</p>
<p><i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> is dominated by a single theme: the evil and immorality of slavery.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> While Stowe weaves other subthemes throughout her text, such as the moral authority of motherhood and the redeeming possibilities offered by <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a>,<sup id="_ref-CompleteIdiot_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CompleteIdiot" title="">[3]</a></sup> she emphasizes the connections between these and the horrors of slavery. Stowe pushed home her theme of the immorality of slavery on almost every page of the novel, sometimes even changing the story&#39;s voice so she could give a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Homily" id="w">homily</a>&#34; on the destructive nature of slavery<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> (such as when a white woman on the steamboat carrying Tom further south states, &#34;The most dreadful part of slavery, to my mind, is its outrages of feelings and affections—the separating of families, for example.&#34;).<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> One way Stowe showed the evil of <a href="/wiki/Slavery" id="w">slavery</a><sup id="_ref-pbs-4p2958_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pbs-4p2958" title="">[18]</a></sup>  was how this &#34;peculiar institution&#34; forcibly separated families from each other.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because Stowe saw motherhood as the &#34;ethical and structural model for all of American life,&#34;<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> and also believed that only women had the moral authority to save<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> the United States from the demon of slavery, another major theme of <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> is the moral power and sanctity of women. Through characters like Eliza, who escapes from slavery to save her young son (and eventually reunites her entire family), or Little Eva, who is seen as the &#34;ideal Christian&#34;,<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Stowe shows how she believed women could save those around them from even the worst injustices. While later critics have noted that Stowe&#39;s female characters are often <a href="/wiki/Domestic_worker" id="w">domestic</a> <a href="/wiki/Cliches" id="w">cliches</a> instead of realistic women,<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Stowe&#39;s novel &#34;reaffirmed the importance of women&#39;s influence&#34; and helped pave the way for the <a href="/wiki/Women%26%2339%3Bs_rights_movement" id="w">women&#39;s rights movement</a> in the following decades.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Stowe&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Puritan" id="w">puritanical</a> religious beliefs show up in the novel&#39;s final, over-arching theme, which is the exploration of the nature of <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a><sup id="_ref-CompleteIdiot_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CompleteIdiot" title="">[3]</a></sup> and how she feels <a href="/wiki/Christian_theology" id="w">Christian theology</a> is fundamentally incompatible with slavery.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> This theme is most evident when Tom urges St. Clare to &#34;look away to Jesus&#34; after the death of St. Clare&#39;s beloved daughter Eva. After Tom dies, George Shelby eulogizes Tom by saying, &#34;What a thing it is to be a Christian.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Because Christian themes play such a large role in <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i>—and because of Stowe&#39;s frequent use of direct authorial interjections on religion and faith—the novel often takes the &#34;form of a sermon.&#34;<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Style" name="Style"></a><h1> Style </h1>

<p><i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> is written in the sentimental<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Melodramatic" id="w">melodramatic</a> style common to 19th century <a href="/wiki/Sentimental_novel" id="w">sentimental novels</a><sup id="_ref-GailSmith_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GailSmith" title="">[5]</a></sup> and domestic fiction (also called women&#39;s fiction). These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe&#39;s time and tended to feature female main characters and a writing style which evoked a reader&#39;s sympathy and emotion.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> Even though Stowe&#39;s novel differs from other sentimental novels by focusing on a large theme like slavery and by having a man as the main character, she still set out to elicit certain strong feelings from her readers (such as making them cry at the death of Little Eva).<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> The power in this type of writing can be seen in the reaction of contemporary readers. Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe&#39;s, wrote a letter to the author stating that &#34;I was up last night long after one o&#39;clock, reading and finishing <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i>. I could not leave it any more than I could have left a dying child.&#34;<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> Another reader is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter Eva.<sup id="_ref-ReadingWomen_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ReadingWomen" title="">[39]</a></sup> Evidently the death of Little Eva affected a lot of people at that time, because in 1852 alone 300 baby girls in Boston were given that name.<sup id="_ref-ReadingWomen_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ReadingWomen" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite this positive reaction from readers, for decades <a href="/wiki/Literary_critic" id="w">literary critics</a> dismissed the style found in <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> and other sentimental novels because these books were written by women and so prominently featured &#34;women&#39;s sloppy emotions.&#34;<sup id="_ref-IntroTompkinsEssay_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IntroTompkinsEssay" title="">[40]</a></sup> One literary critic said that had the novel not been about slavery, &#34;it would be just another sentimental novel,&#34;<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> while another described the book as &#34;primarily a derivative piece of hack work.&#34;<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> George Whicher turned his nose up at the book in his <i>Literary History of the United States</i> by saying it was &#34;Sunday-school fiction&#34; and full of &#34;broadly conceived melodrama, humor, and pathos.&#34;<sup id="_ref-JaneTompkins_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JaneTompkins" title="">[43]</a></sup> </p>
<p>However, in 1985 Jane Tompkins changed this view of <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> with her landmark book <i>In Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction.</i><sup id="_ref-IntroTompkinsEssay_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IntroTompkinsEssay" title="">[40]</a></sup> Tompkins praised the very sentimental style so many other critics had dismissed, noting that sentimental novels showed how women&#39;s emotions had the power to change the world for the better. She also said that the popular domestic novels of the 19th century, including <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i>, were remarkable for their &#34;intellectual complexity, ambition, and resourcefulness; and that <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> offers a &#34;critique of American society far more devastating than any delivered by better-known critics such as Hawthorne and Melville.&#34;<sup id="_ref-JaneTompkins_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JaneTompkins" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite this changing view of <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin<b>s style, because the book is written so differently from most modern novels, today&#39;s readers can find the book&#39;s prose to be dense, overdone, or &#34;even corny.&#34;<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<a id="Reactions_to_the_novel" name="Reactions_to_the_novel"></a><h1> Reactions to the novel </h1>

<p><i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> has exerted an influence &#34;equaled by few other novels in history.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Britannica_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Britannica" title="">[45]</a></sup> Upon publication, <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> ignited a firestorm of protest from defenders of slavery (who created a number of books in response to the novel) while the book elicited praise from abolitionists. As a best-seller, the novel heavily influenced later protest literature (such as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Jungle" id="w">The Jungle</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Upton_Sinclair" id="w">Upton Sinclair</a>).</p>
<a id="Contemporary_and_world_reaction" name="Contemporary_and_world_reaction"></a><h2> Contemporary and world reaction </h2>

<p>Immediately upon publication, <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> outraged people in the <a href="/wiki/American_South" id="w">American South</a>.<sup id="_ref-pbs-4p2958_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pbs-4p2958" title="">[18]</a></sup> The novel was also roundly criticized by slavery supporters.</p>
<p>Acclaimed Southern novelist <a href="/wiki/William_Gilmore_Simms" id="w">William Gilmore Simms</a> declared the work utterly false,<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> while others called the novel criminal and slanderous.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> Reactions ranged from a bookseller in <a href="/wiki/Mobile%2C_Alabama" id="w">Mobile, Alabama</a> who was forced to leave town for selling the novel<sup id="_ref-pbs-4p2958_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pbs-4p2958" title="">[18]</a></sup> to threatening letters sent to Stowe herself (including a package containing a slave&#39;s severed ear).<sup id="_ref-pbs-4p2958_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pbs-4p2958" title="">[18]</a></sup> Many Southern writers, like Simms, soon wrote their own books in opposition to Stowe&#39;s novel (see the <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tom%26%2339%3Bs_Cabin#Anti-Tom literature" id="w">Anti-Tom section below</a>).<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some critics highlighted Stowe&#39;s paucity of life-experience relating to Southern life, which (in their view) led her to create inaccurate descriptions of the region. For instance, she had never set foot on a Southern plantation. However, Stowe always said she based the characters of her book on stories she was told by runaway slaves in <a href="/wiki/Cincinnati%2C_Ohio" id="w">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, where Stowe lived. It is reported that, &#34;She observed firsthand several incidents which galvanized her to write [the] famous anti-slavery novel. Scenes she observed on the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_River" id="w">Ohio River</a>, including seeing a husband and wife being sold apart, as well as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews, contributed material to the emerging plot.&#34;<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>In response to these criticisms, in 1853 Stowe published <i><a href="/wiki/A_Key_to_Uncle_Tom%26%2339%3Bs_Cabin" id="w">A Key to Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</a></i>, an attempt to document the veracity of the novel&#39;s depiction of slavery. In the book, Stowe discusses each of the major characters in <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> and cites &#34;real life equivalents&#34; to them while also mounting a more &#34;aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had.&#34;<sup id="_ref-UTCKey_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UTCKey" title="">[15]</a></sup> Like the novel, <i>A Key to Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> was also a best-seller. It should be noted, though, that while Stowe claimed <i>A Key to Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> documented her previously consulted sources, she actually read many of the cited works only after the publication of her novel.<sup id="_ref-UTCKey_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UTCKey" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite these supposed and actual flaws in Stowe&#39;s research, and despite the shrill attacks from defenders of slavery, the novel still captured the imagination of many Americans. According to Stowe&#39;s son, when <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" id="w">Abraham Lincoln</a> met her in 1862 Lincoln commented, &#34;So this is the little lady who started this great war.&#34;<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> Historians are undecided if Lincoln actually said this line, and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made.<sup id="_ref-Claybaugh_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Claybaugh" title="">[51]</a></sup> Since then, many writers have credited this novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of slavery and the <a href="/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Law" id="w">Fugitive Slave Law</a><sup id="_ref-Claybaugh_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Claybaugh" title="">[51]</a></sup> and helping to fuel the <a href="/wiki/Abolitionist" id="w">abolitionist</a> movement.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)" id="w">Union</a> <a href="/wiki/General" id="w">General</a> and <a href="/wiki/Politician" id="w">politician</a> <a href="/wiki/James_Baird_Weaver" id="w">James Baird Weaver</a> said that the book convinced him to become active in the abolitionist movement.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> also created great interest in England. The first London edition appeared in May, 1852, and sold 200,000 copies.<sup id="_ref-pbs-4p2958_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pbs-4p2958" title="">[18]</a></sup>  Some of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, &#34;The evil passions which &#39;Uncle Tom&#39; gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance [of slavery], but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America—we are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system—our Tories hate her democrats—our <a href="/wiki/British_Whig_Party" id="w">Whigs</a> hate her <a href="/wiki/Parvenu" id="w">parvenus</a>—our Radicals hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy.&#34;<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Charles_Francis_Adams" id="w">Charles Francis Adams</a>, the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that, &#34;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed.&#34;<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>The book has been translated into almost every language, including Chinese (with translator <a href="/wiki/Lin_Shu" id="w">Lin Shu</a> creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel) and <a href="/wiki/Amharic_language" id="w">Amharic</a> (with the 1930 translation created in support of <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" id="w">Ethiopian</a> efforts to end the suffering of blacks in that nation).<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> The book was so widely read that <a href="/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" id="w">Sigmund Freud</a> reported a number of patients with <a href="/wiki/Sadism_and_masochism_as_medical_terms" id="w">sado-masochistic</a> tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i>.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Literary_significance_and_criticism" name="Literary_significance_and_criticism"></a><h2> Literary significance and criticism </h2>

<p>As the first widely read political novel in the United States,<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> greatly influenced development of not only <a href="/wiki/American_literature" id="w">American literature</a> but also protest literature in general. Later books which owe a large debt to <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> include <i><a href="/wiki/The_Jungle" id="w">The Jungle</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Upton_Sinclair" id="w">Upton Sinclair</a> and <i><a href="/wiki/Silent_Spring" id="w">Silent Spring</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Carson" id="w">Rachel Carson</a>.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite this undisputed significance, the popular perception of <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> is as &#34;a blend of children&#39;s fable and propaganda.&#34;<sup id="_ref-The Nation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Nation" title="">[60]</a></sup> The novel has also been dismissed by a number of <a href="/wiki/Literary_critics" id="w">literary critics</a> as &#34;merely a sentimental novel,&#34;<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> while critic George Whicher stated in his <i>Literary History of the United States</i> that &#34;Nothing attributable to Mrs. Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novel&#39;s enormous vogue; its author&#39;s resources as a purveyor of Sunday-school fiction were not remarkable. She had at most a ready command of broadly conceived melodrama, humor, and pathos, and of these popular cements she compounded her book.&#34;<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other critics, though, have praised the novel. Edmund Wilson stated that &#34;To expose oneself in maturity to Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin may … prove a startling experience.&#34;<sup id="_ref-The Nation_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Nation" title="">[60]</a></sup> Jane Tompkins states that the novel is one of the classics of American literature and wonders if many literary critics aren&#39;t dismissing the book because it was simply too popular during its day.<sup id="_ref-JaneTompkins_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JaneTompkins" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>Over the years scholars have postulated a number of theories about what Stowe was trying to say with the novel (aside from the obvious <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tom%26%2339%3Bs_Cabin#Major themes" id="w">themes</a>, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent <a href="/wiki/Christian" id="w">Christian</a> and active <a href="/wiki/Abolitionist" id="w">abolitionist</a>, Stowe placed many of her religion&#39;s beliefs into the novel.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe&#39;s characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris?<sup id="_ref-Bellin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bellin" title="">[64]</a></sup> Stowe&#39;s solution was similar to <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson" id="w">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>&#39;s: God&#39;s will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.<sup id="_ref-Bellin_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bellin" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>Scholars have also seen the novel as expressing the values and ideas of the <a href="/wiki/Free_Soil" id="w">Free Soil</a> Movement.<sup id="_ref-Grant_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grant" title="">[65]</a></sup> In this view, the character of George Harris embodies the principles of free labor, while the complex character of Ophelia represents those Northerners who condoned compromise with slavery. In contrast to Ophelia is Dinah, who operates on passion. During the course of the novel Ophelia is transformed, just as the Republican Party (3 years later) proclaimed that the North must transform itself and stand up for its antislavery principles.<sup id="_ref-Grant_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grant" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Feminist_theory" id="w">Feminist theory</a> can also be seen at play in Stowe&#39;s book, with the novel as a critique of the <a href="/wiki/Patriarchal" id="w">patriarchal</a> nature of slavery.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person&#39;s family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.</p>
<p>The book has also been seen as an attempt to redefine masculinity as a necessary step toward the abolition of slavery.<sup id="_ref-Wolff_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wolff" title="">[67]</a></sup> In this view, abolitionists had begun to resist the vision of aggressive and dominant men that the conquest and colonization of the early 19th century had fostered. In order to change the notion of manhood so that men could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self-image or their standing in society, some abolitionists drew on principles of women&#39;s suffrage and Christianity as well as passivism, and praised men for cooperation, compassion, and civic spirit. Others within the abolitionist movement argued for conventional, aggressive masculine action. All the men in Stowe&#39;s novel are representations of either one kind of man or the other.<sup id="_ref-Wolff_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wolff" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>

<p>In recent decades, scholars and readers have criticized the book for what are seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book&#39;s black characters, especially with regard to the characters&#39; appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> The novel&#39;s creation and use of common <a href="/wiki/Stereotypes" id="w">stereotypes</a> about <a href="/wiki/African_Americans" id="w">African Americans</a><sup id="_ref-Husler_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Husler" title="">[9]</a></sup> is important because <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century.<sup id="_ref-bookrags_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bookrags" title="">[6]</a></sup> As a result, the book (along with images illustrating the book<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> and associated stage productions) had a major role in permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the last few decades these negative associations have to a large degree overshadowed the historical impact of <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> as a &#34;vital antislavery tool.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Africana_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Africana" title="">[10]</a></sup> The beginning of this change in the novel&#39;s perception had its roots in an essay by <a href="/wiki/James_Baldwin_(writer)" id="w">James Baldwin</a> titled &#34;Everybody’s Protest Novel.&#34; In the essay, Baldwin called <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i> a &#34;very bad novel&#34; which was also racially obtuse and aesthetically crude.<sup id="_ref-Rothstein_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rothstein" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1960s and &#39;70s, the <a href="/wiki/Black_Power" id="w">Black Power</a> and <a href="/wiki/Black_Arts_Movement" id="w">Black Arts Movements</a> attacked the novel, saying that the character of Uncle Tom engaged in &#34;race betrayal,&#34; making Tom (in some eyes) worse than even the most vicious slave owner.<sup id="_ref-Rothstein_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rothstein" title="">[71]</a></sup> Criticisms of the other stereotypes in the book also increased during this time.</p>
<p>In recent years, though, scholars such as <a href="/wiki/Henry_Louis_Gates_Jr." id="w">Henry Louis Gates Jr.</a> have begun to reexamine <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i>, stating that the book is a &#34;central document in American race relations and a significant moral and political exploration of the character of those relations.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Rothstein_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rothstein" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Anti-Tom_literature" name="Anti-Tom_literature"></a><h1> Anti-Tom literature </h1>
<p>{{main}}
In response to <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i>, writers in the <a href="/wiki/Southern_United_States" id="w">Southern United States</a> produced a number of books to rebut Stowe&#39;s novel. This so-called Anti-Tom literature generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing that the issues of slavery as depicted in Stowe&#39;s book were overblown and incorrect. The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over child-like slaves in a benevolent extended-family-style plantation. The novels either implied or directly stated that African Americans were a child-like people<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p>Among the most famous anti-Tom books are <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sword_and_the_Distaff" id="w">The Sword and the Distaff</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/William_Gilmore_Simms" id="w">William Gilmore Simms</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Aunt_Phillis%26%2339%3Bs_Cabin" id="w">Aunt Phillis&#39;s Cabin</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Mary_Henderson_Eastman" id="w">Mary Henderson Eastman</a>, and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Planter%26%2339%3Bs_Northern_Bride" id="w">The Planter&#39;s Northern Bride</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Caroline_Lee_Hentz" id="w">Caroline Lee Hentz</a>,<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> with the last author having been a close personal friend of Stowe&#39;s when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms&#39; book was published a few months after Stowe&#39;s novel and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe&#39;s book and her view of slavery. Hentz&#39;s 1854 novel, widely-read at the time, but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen through the eyes of a northern woman—the daughter of an abolitionist, no less—who marries a southern slave owner. </p>
<p>In the decade between the publication of <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> and the start of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>, between twenty and thirty anti-Tom books were published. Among these novels are two books titled <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin As It Is</i> (one by W.L. Smith and the other by C.H. Wiley) and a book by <a href="/wiki/John_Pendleton_Kennedy" id="w">John Pendleton Kennedy</a>. More than half of these Anti-Tom books were written by white women, with Simms commenting at one point about the &#34;Seemingly poetic justice of having the Northern woman (Stowe) answered by a Southern woman.&#34;<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup></p>

<p>Even though <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> was the best-selling novel of the 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story as a stage <a href="/wiki/Play" id="w">play</a> or <a href="/wiki/Musical_theatre" id="w">musical</a> than read the book.<sup id="_ref-By storm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-By storm" title="">[76]</a></sup> Eric Lott, in his book <i>Uncle Tomitudes: Racial Melodrama and Modes of Production,</i> estimates that at least three million people saw these plays, ten times the book&#39;s first-year sales.</p>
<p>Given the lax copyright laws of the time, stage plays based on <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i>—&#34;Tom shows&#34;—began to appear while the story itself was still being serialized. Stowe refused to authorize dramatization of her work because of her <a href="/wiki/Puritan" id="w">puritanical</a> distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see <a href="/wiki/George_Aiken_(playwright)" id="w">George Aiken</a>&#39;s version, and, according to Francis Underwood, was &#34;delighted&#34; by Caroline Howard&#39;s portrayal of Topsy).<sup id="_ref-Lott_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lott" title="">[77]</a></sup> Stowe&#39;s refusal left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures. </p>
<p>All &#34;Tom shows&#34; appear to have incorporated elements of <a href="/wiki/Melodrama" id="w">melodrama</a> and <a href="/wiki/Blackface" id="w">blackface</a> <a href="/wiki/Minstrel_show" id="w">minstrelsy</a>.<sup id="_ref-Africanapg44_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Africanapg44" title="">[78]</a></sup> These plays varied tremendously in their politics—some faithfully reflected Stowe&#39;s sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery.<sup id="_ref-Lott_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lott" title="">[77]</a></sup> Many of the productions featured demeaning racial caricatures of Black people,<sup id="_ref-Africanapg44_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Africanapg44" title="">[78]</a></sup> while a number of productions also featured songs by <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Foster" id="w">Stephen Foster</a> (including &#34;<a href="/wiki/My_Old_Kentucky_Home" id="w">My Old Kentucky Home</a>,&#34; &#34;<a href="/wiki/Old_Folks_at_Home" id="w">Old Folks at Home</a>,&#34; and &#34;Massa&#39;s in the Cold Ground&#34;).<sup id="_ref-By storm_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-By storm" title="">[76]</a></sup> The best-known &#34;Tom Shows&#34; were those of <a href="/wiki/George_Aiken_(playwright)" id="w">George Aiken</a> and <a href="/wiki/H.J._Conway" id="w">H.J.

<p>{{main}}</p>
<p><i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> has been made into a number of film versions. Most of these movies were created during the <a href="/wiki/Silent_film" id="w">silent film</a> era (with <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> being the most-filmed story of that time period).<sup id="_ref-UTCFilm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UTCFilm" title="">[79]</a></sup> This was due to the continuing popularity of both the book and &#34;Tom shows,&#34; meaning audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words.<sup id="_ref-UTCFilm_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UTCFilm" title="">[79]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first film version of <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> was one of the earliest &#34;full-length&#34; movies (although &#34;full-length&#34; at that time meant between 10 and 14 minutes).<sup id="_ref-Porter_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Porter" title="">[80]</a></sup> This 1903 film, directed by <a href="/wiki/Edwin_S._Porter" id="w">Edwin S.

This version was evidently similar to many of the &#34;Tom Shows&#34; of earlier decades and featured a large number of black stereotypes (such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction).<sup id="_ref-Porter_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Porter" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1910, a 3-Reel Vitagraph Company of America production was directed by <a href="/wiki/J._Stuart_Blackton" id="w">J. Stuart Blackton</a> and adapted by Eugene Mullin. According to <i>The Dramatic Mirror,</i> this film was &#34;a decided innovation&#34; in motion pictures and &#34;the first time an American company&#34; released a dramatic film in 3 reels. Until then, &#34;full-length&#34; movies of the time were 15 minutes long and contained only one reel of film. The movie starred <a href="/wiki/Florence_Turner" id="w">Florence Turner</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mary_Fuller" id="w">Mary Fuller</a>, Edwin R.

<p>At least four more movie adaptations were created in the next two decades. The last silent film version came in 1927. Directed by <a href="/wiki/Harry_A._Pollard" id="w">Harry A. Pollard</a> (who&#39;d played Uncle Tom in a 1913 release of <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i>), this two-hour movie spent more than a year in production and was the third most expensive picture of the silent era (at a cost of $1.8 million). Black actor <a href="/wiki/Charles_Gilpin" id="w">Charles Gilpin</a> was originally cast in the title role, but was fired after the studio decided his &#34;portrayal was too aggressive.&#34;<sup id="_ref-SuperJewel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SuperJewel" title="">[82]</a></sup> James B. Lowe then took over the character of Tom. One difference in this film from the novel is that after Tom dies, he returns as a vengeful spirit and confronts Simon Legree before leading the slave owner to his death. Black media outlets of the time praised the film, but the studio—fearful of a backlash from Southern and white film audiences—ended up cutting out controversial scenes, including the film&#39;s opening sequence at a slave auction (where a mother is torn away from her baby).<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> The story was adapted by Pollard, Harvey F. Thew and A.P. Younger, with titles by Walter Anthony. It starred James B. Lowe, <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Grey" id="w">Virginia Grey</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Siegmann" id="w">George Siegmann</a>, Margarita Fischer, <a href="/wiki/Mona_Ray" id="w">Mona Ray</a> and <a href="/wiki/Madame_Sul-Te-Wan" id="w">Madame Sul-Te-Wan</a>.<sup id="_ref-SuperJewel_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SuperJewel" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>
<p>For several decades after the end of the silent film era, the subject matter of Stowe&#39;s novel was judged too sensitive for further film interpretation.

<p><i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> has also influenced a large number of movies, including <a href="/wiki/Birth_of_a_Nation" id="w">Birth of a Nation</a>.
