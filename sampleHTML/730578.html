<b>Anna Wintour</b> (born <a href="/wiki/November_3" id="w">November 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a>, in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>) is the <a href="/wiki/Editor-in-chief" id="w">editor-in-chief</a> of <a href="/wiki/Media_in_the_United_States" id="w">American</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)" id="w">Vogue</a></i>, a position she has held since 1988. She became interested in <a href="/wiki/Fashion" id="w">fashion</a> as a teenager. Her father, Charles, editor of the <i><a href="/wiki/Evening_Standard" id="w">Evening Standard</a></i>, often consulted with her on how to make the newspaper&#39;s coverage relevant to the youth of mid-<a href="/wiki/1960s" id="w">1960s</a> London. After dropping out of school at 16, she began a career in <a href="/wiki/Fashion_journalism" id="w">fashion journalism</a>. Her career took her across the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic</a>, with notable stints at <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_(magazine)" id="w">New York</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Home_%26amp%3B_Garden" id="w">Home &#38; Garden</a></i>. She returned home for a tumultuous year to turn around British <i>Vogue</i>, and later assumed control of the franchise&#39;s flagship magazine in <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>. She revived a stagnant publication, a success that has earned her wide acclaim in the industry.</p>
<p>Like one of her predecessors, <a href="/wiki/Diana_Vreeland" id="w">Diana Vreeland</a>, she has become a fashion <a href="/wiki/Icon" id="w">icon</a>. Her <a href="/wiki/Pageboy" id="w">pageboy</a> <a href="/wiki/Bob_cut" id="w">bob</a> <a href="/wiki/Haircut" id="w">haircut</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sunglasses" id="w">sunglasses</a> have become a common sight in the front row of the most exclusive <a href="/wiki/Fashion_show" id="w">fashion shows</a>. Away from the cameras, she has become as much an institution in the fashion world as her magazine. Universally hailed for her keen eye for fashion trends and support for younger <a href="/wiki/Fashion_designer" id="w">designers</a>, her aloof and demanding persona has earned her the nickname &#34;Nuclear Wintour&#34;. A former <a href="/wiki/Personal_assistant" id="w">personal assistant</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lauren_Weisberger" id="w">Lauren Weisberger</a>, wrote the <a href="/wiki/2003_in_literature" id="w">2003</a> <a href="/wiki/Best_seller" id="w">bestselling</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Roman_%C3%A0_clef" id="w">roman Ã  clef</a></i> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Devil_Wears_Prada_(novel)" id="w">The Devil Wears Prada</a></i>, later made into a successful <a href="/wiki/The_Devil_Wears_Prada_(film)" id="w">film</a> starring <a href="/wiki/Meryl_Streep" id="w">Meryl Streep</a> as <a href="/wiki/Miranda_Priestly" id="w">Miranda Priestly</a>, a fashion editor widely believed to be based on Wintour. She has also drawn both praise and criticism for her willingness to use the magazine and its cachet to shape the industry as a whole. <a href="/wiki/Animal_rights" id="w">Animal rights</a> activists have also singled her out for her continued promotion of <a href="/wiki/Fur" id="w">fur</a>.</p>

<p>Her father, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Vere_Wintour" id="w">Charles Vere Wintour</a>, <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" id="w">CBE</a>, was an editor of The <i><a href="/wiki/Evening_Standard" id="w">Evening Standard</a></i>; her mother was his first wife, Eleanor (&#34;Nonie&#34;) Trego Baker, the daughter of a <a href="/wiki/Harvard_Law_School" id="w">Harvard law professor</a>, whom he <a href="/wiki/Marriage" id="w">married</a> in <a href="/wiki/1940" id="w">1940</a> and <a href="/wiki/Divorce" id="w">divorced</a> in <a href="/wiki/1979" id="w">1979</a>.

<p>The young Wintour was educated at <a href="/wiki/North_London_Collegiate_School" id="w">North London Collegiate School</a>, where she frequently rebelled against the <a href="/wiki/Social_aspects_of_clothing#Private dress codes" id="w">dress code</a> by taking up her <a href="/wiki/Skirt" id="w">skirts</a>.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer15_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer15" title="">[7]</a></sup> At the age of 14 she began wearing her hair in the <a href="/wiki/Bob_cut" id="w">bob</a> that has since become her trademark.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer21_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer21" title="">[8]</a></sup> As London began to <a href="/wiki/Swinging_London" id="w">swing</a>, she became a <a href="/wiki/Dedicated_Follower_Of_Fashion" id="w">dedicated follower of fashion</a> as a regular viewer of <a href="/wiki/Cathy_McGowan" id="w">Cathy McGowan</a> on <i><a href="/wiki/Ready_Steady_Go!" id="w">Ready Steady Go!</a></i>, and her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer22_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer22" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>

<a id="From_fashion_to_journalism" name="From_fashion_to_journalism"></a><h3>From fashion to journalism</h3>
<p>Charles Wintour arranged his daughter&#39;s first job, at the influential <a href="/wiki/Biba" id="w">Biba</a> boutique, when she was 15.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer42-44_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer42-44" title="">[13]</a></sup> The next year, she dropped out of North London Collegiate. Wintour chose not to go to college but instead entered a training program at <a href="/wiki/Harrods" id="w">Harrods</a>. At her parents&#39; behest, she also took some fashion classes at a nearby school, but soon dropped out, saying &#34;you either know fashion or you don&#39;t&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer51_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer51" title="">[14]</a></sup> She continued dating well-connected older men, this time Peter Gitterman, the stepson of <a href="/wiki/London_Philharmonic_Orchestra" id="w">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a> conductor <a href="/wiki/Georg_Solti" id="w">Georg Solti</a>.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer52_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer52" title="">[15]</a></sup> Another boyfriend, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Neville_(writer)" id="w">Richard Neville</a>, gave her her first look at magazine production when she hung around the offices of his popular and controversial <i><a href="/wiki/Oz_(magazine)" id="w">Oz</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer58-62_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer58-62" title="">[16]</a></sup> </p>
<p>She entered the field of <a href="/wiki/Fashion_journalism" id="w">fashion journalism</a> in <a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a> when <i><a href="/wiki/Harper%26%2339%3Bs_Bazaar" id="w">Harper&#39;s Bazaar</a></i> merged with <i>Queen</i> to become <i>Harper&#39;s &#38; Queen</i>, and the new magazine needed editorial assistants.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer63_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer63" title="">[17]</a></sup> While there, she let it be known to her coworkers she ultimately wanted to edit <i>Vogue</i>.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer70_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer70" title="">[18]</a></sup> She discovered model Annabel Hodin, a former North London classmate, and used the connections she had built up to secure locations for some striking, innovative shoots, often shot by <a href="/wiki/Helmut_Newton" id="w">Helmut Newton</a> and other trend-setting photographers.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer81_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer81" title="">[19]</a></sup> One shoot recreated the works of <a href="/wiki/Pierre-Auguste_Renoir" id="w">Renoir</a> and <a href="/wiki/Manet" id="w">Manet</a> using models in <a href="/wiki/Go-go_boots" id="w">go-go boots</a>.<sup id="_ref-Met bio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Met bio" title="">[20]</a></sup> She left the magazine in 1975 after chronic disagreements with new editor Min Hogg, whose job Anna herself had vied for,<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer96_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer96" title="">[21]</a></sup> and relocated to New York with yet another older boyfriend, freelance journalist and playboy Jon Bradshaw.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer100_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer100" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<a id="New_York" name="New_York"></a><h3>New York</h3>

<p>She became a junior fashion editor at <i><a href="/wiki/Harper%26%2339%3Bs_Bazaar" id="w">Harper&#39;s Bazaar</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York</a> in <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a>.<sup id="_ref-Met bio_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Met bio" title="">[20]</a></sup> Her innovative shoots caused conflict with editor Tony Mazzola, and she was fired after nine months, although she has often claimed to have worked there for longer.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer109_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer109" title="">[23]</a></sup> During that time she was introduced to <a href="/wiki/Bob_Marley" id="w">Bob Marley</a> by one of Bradshaw&#39;s friends, and disappeared with him for a week.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer107_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer107" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>After several months, Bradshaw&#39;s help got her her first position as a fashion editor, with <i><a href="/wiki/Viva_(magazine)" id="w">Viva</a></i>, a women&#39;s adult magazine started by <a href="/wiki/Kathy_Keeton" id="w">Kathy Keeton</a>, then wife of <i><a href="/wiki/Penthouse_(magazine)" id="w">Penthouse</a></i> publisher <a href="/wiki/Bob_Guccione" id="w">Bob Guccione</a>. While she was there for two years until it folded in 1979, she has rarely admitted to working there due to the <i>Penthouse</i> connection.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer118_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer118" title="">[25]</a></sup> It would be the first position for which she would be able to hire a <a href="/wiki/Personal_assistant" id="w">personal assistant</a>, and along with it came her reputation for being a demanding and difficult boss.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer120_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer120" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>When Guccione shut down the money-losing <i>Viva</i> in late 1978, Wintour decided instead to take some time off. She had endured a difficult breakup with Bradshaw, briefly dating <a href="/wiki/Eric_Idle" id="w">Eric Idle</a> afterwards.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer141_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer141" title="">[27]</a></sup> But then she wound up with <a href="/wiki/French_people" id="w">French</a> <a href="/wiki/Record_producer" id="w">record producer</a> Michel Esteban, dividing her time with him between Paris and New York.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer152_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer152" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Return_to_publishing" name="Return_to_publishing"></a><h3>Return to publishing</h3>

<p>In 1980, she went back to work, succeeding <a href="/wiki/Elsa_Klensch" id="w">Elsa Klensch</a> as fashion editor for a new women&#39;s magazine named <i><a href="/wiki/Savvy" id="w">Savvy</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Larson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson" title="">[29]</a></sup> It sought to appeal to career-conscious professional women who could and would make purchases with their own earnings<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer159_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer159" title="">[30]</a></sup>, a reader Wintour would later target with <i>Vogue</i>.</p>
<p>The next year, she moved on to become fashion editor of <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_(magazine)" id="w">New York</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Met bio_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Met bio" title="">[20]</a></sup> It would be the turning point of her career. There, the fashion spreads and photo shoots she had been putting together for years finally began attracting the attention she wanted them to in the industry, and made her a favorite of editor Edward Kosner. He sometimes bent  very strict rules for her,<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer188_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer188" title="">[31]</a></sup> and aroused the ire of the rest of the staff. Nevertheless, he began letting her work on other sections of the magazine, and she learned through her work on a cover involving <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Ward" id="w">Rachel Ward</a> how effectively celebrity covers sold copies.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer188_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer188" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>A former colleague arranged for an interview with <i>Vogue</i> editor <a href="/wiki/Grace_Mirabella" id="w">Grace Mirabella</a>. It ended quickly, with Anna declaring that it was Mirabella&#39;s job she was after.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer190_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer190" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Cond%C3%A9_Nast" name="Cond%C3%A9_Nast"></a><h3>CondÃ© Nast</h3>

<p>Among those in the magazine business whose eye her <i>New York</i> spreads eventually caught was Alex Liberman, editorial director for <a href="/wiki/Cond%C3%A9_Nast_Publications" id="w">CondÃ© Nast</a>, publisher of <i>Vogue</i>. In 1983, he talked to Wintour about a position at that magazine, and she eventually accepted after a bidding war which doubled her salary.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer207_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer207" title="">[33]</a></sup> </p>
<p>She was given the newly created title of creative director.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer207_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer207" title="">[33]</a></sup> Since her responsibilities were not clearly defined, she often changed aspects of the magazine without letting Mirabella know, which caused friction between Wintour and other staffers.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer208-10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer208-10" title="">[34]</a></sup> During this time, she began dating another older man, prominent <a href="/wiki/Child_psychiatry" id="w">child psychiatrist</a> <a href="/wiki/David_Shaffer" id="w">David Shaffer</a>, thirteen years her senior, an acquaintance from her younger days in London. He gave her strong emotional support during a difficult and stressful period in her career.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer193_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer193" title="">[35]</a></sup> The two married in September 1984.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer223_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer223" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wintour became <a href="/wiki/Pregnancy" id="w">pregnant</a> by him shortly thereafter, and a year after the marriage was chosen to replace longtime British <i>Vogue</i> editor Beatrix Miller.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer230_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer230" title="">[37]</a></sup> She took over in April 1986, shortly after giving birth to her son, Charlie.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer233_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer233" title="">[38]</a></sup> Her husband remained in New York, working on a research project about <a href="/wiki/Teenage_suicide" id="w">teenage suicide</a>,<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer230_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer230" title="">[37]</a></sup> and the company paid for her <a href="/wiki/Townhouse" id="w">townhouse</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nanny" id="w">nanny</a> and frequent roundtrip flights on the <a href="/wiki/Concorde" id="w">Concorde</a> for the two.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer239_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer239" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>She radically changed British <i>Vogue</i>, steering it from a tradition of eccentricity to a direction more in tune with the American magazine, borrowing her ideal reader from <i>Savvy</i>. &#34; There&#39;s a new kind of woman out there&#34;, she told her father&#39;s old paper, the <i>Evening Standard</i>. &#34;She&#39;s interested in business and money. She doesn&#39;t have time to shop anymore. She wants to know what and why and where and how.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Larson_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson" title="">[29]</a></sup> She replaced many staffers and exerted far more control over the magazine than any previous editor had, earning the nickname &#34;Nuclear Wintour&#34; in the process.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer243_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer243" title="">[40]</a></sup> Those editors who were retained began to refer to the period as &#34;The Wintour of Our Discontent&#34;. &#34;It was the end of life as we knew it&#34;, said <a href="/wiki/Liz_Tilberis" id="w">Liz Tilberis</a>, who had hoped for the top job herself.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer240_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer240" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Tilberis got the job in mid-1987 when Wintour returned to New York to take over <i><a href="/wiki/House_%26amp%3B_Garden_(magazine)" id="w">House &#38; Garden</a></i>. It had long lagged <i><a href="/wiki/Architectural_Digest" id="w">Architectural Digest</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer269_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer269" title="">[42]</a></sup> and the company gave her a free hand. Again, she made radical changes to staff and look. &#34;She destroyed <i>House &#38; Garden</i> in about two days,&#34; complained a fired editor, referring to the $2 million worth of photo spreads and articles she cancelled in her first week.<sup id="_ref-Time 1988_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Time 1988" title="">[43]</a></sup> She put so much fashion in photo spreads that industry wags began to refer to the magazine as <i>House &#38; Garment</i>, and enough celebrities that it was referred to as <i>Vanity Chair</i>.<sup id="_ref-Slate_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Slate" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wintour&#39;s changes did, indeed, have a negative effect on the magazine. When &#34;HG&#34; became the name on the cover in March 1988, many longtime subscribers thought they were getting a new magazine and put it aside for the real thing to arrive.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer269_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer269" title="">[42]</a></sup> Many eventually canceled, and while some fashion advertisers came over, most of the magazine&#39;s traditional advertisers pulled out.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer271_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer271" title="">[45]</a></sup></p> 
<p>After ten months, Conde Nast finally made a long-awaited move and put her into the job she had aimed for since 1971: the editorship of <i>Vogue</i>. Under Mirabella, it had become more focused on lifestyles as a whole and less on fashion.<sup id="_ref-Slate_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Slate" title="">[44]</a></sup> Industry insiders worried that it was losing ground to the upstart American edition of <i><a href="/wiki/ELLE" id="w">ELLE</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-Slate_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Slate" title="">[44]</a></sup> which had been introduced from <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> in <a href="/wiki/1985" id="w">1985</a>.<sup id="_ref-Larson_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson" title="">[29]</a></sup> Besides sweeping staff changes, Wintour made her mark early on with a shift in the cover pictures. Whereas Mirabella had preferred tight <a href="/wiki/Head_shot" id="w">headshots</a> of well-known models, Wintour&#39;s covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, in <a href="/wiki/Natural_light" id="w">natural light</a>, instead of the <a href="/wiki/Studio" id="w">studio</a>, echoing what editor <a href="/wiki/Diana_Vreeland" id="w">Diana Vreeland</a> had done years earlier.<sup id="_ref-Larson_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson" title="">[29]</a></sup> She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with the high fashion â the first issue she was in charge of, in November of that year, featured a young <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israeli</a> model in a $50 pair of faded <a href="/wiki/Jeans" id="w">jeans</a> and a bejeweled <a href="/wiki/T-shirt" id="w">T-shirt</a> by <a href="/wiki/Christian_Lacroix" id="w">Christian Lacroix</a> worth $10,000. Eight months later, another model was shown in wet hair, with just a <a href="/wiki/Terrycloth" id="w">terrycloth</a> <a href="/wiki/Bathrobe" id="w">bathrobe</a> and apparently without <a href="/wiki/Makeup" id="w">makeup</a>.<sup id="_ref-Slate_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Slate" title="">[44]</a></sup> She also made a point of seeing to it that photographers, <a href="/wiki/Makeup" id="w">makeup</a> artists and <a href="/wiki/Hairstylist" id="w">hairstylists</a> got as much credit for the images as the models.<sup id="_ref-Larson_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson" title="">[29]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Under her editorship, the magazine renewed its focus on fashion and returned to the prominence it had held under <a href="/wiki/Diana_Vreeland" id="w">Diana Vreeland</a>. <i>Vogue</i> held off the challenge from not only <i>ELLE</i> but <i>Harper&#39;s Bazaar</i>, which had lured Tilberis to compete with Wintour, and <i><a href="/wiki/Mirabella" id="w">Mirabella</a></i>, a magazine Rupert Murdoch founded for Wintour&#39;s predecessor. Her most serious adversary, in fact, was within the company â <a href="/wiki/Tina_Brown" id="w">Tina Brown</a>, editor of <i><a href="/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" id="w">Vanity Fair</a></i> and later <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Yorker" id="w">The New Yorker</a></i>, whom she competed against for writers and photographers.

The <a href="/wiki/Miranda_Priestly" id="w">Miranda Priestly</a> character in the novel has <a href="/wiki/The_Devil_Wears_Prada_(novel)#Realism" id="w">many similarities</a> to Wintour â among them, she is British, has two children, and serves on the board of the <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art" id="w">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>. Priestly is depicted as a <a href="/wiki/Tyranny" id="w">tyrant</a> who makes impossible demands of her subordinates, gives them almost none of the information or time necessary to comply and then berates them for their failures to do so.<sup id="_ref-novel cite_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-novel cite" title="">[67]</a></sup> Prior to its publication, Wintour told the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" id="w">New York Times</a></i>, &#34;I always enjoy a great piece of fiction. I haven&#39;t decided whether I am going to read it or not.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Times quote_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Times quote" title="">[68]</a></sup> While it has been suggested that the setting and Priestly were based on <i>Vogue</i> and Wintour, Weisberger denies this, and even gives Wintour herself a cameo appearance near the end of the book. </p>
<p>The novel&#39;s portrayal of Wintour/Priestly is not entirely negative. Andrea notes that she does manage the difficult task of making all the key editorial decisions in a major fashion magazine every month all by herself,<sup id="_ref-novel cite1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-novel cite1" title="">[69]</a></sup> and that she has genuine class and style.<sup id="_ref-novel cite2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-novel cite2" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet it is almost universally believed that the book&#39;s success was due to the real-life angle. Neither <i>Vogue</i> nor any other CondÃ© Nast publications reviewed Weisberger&#39;s book. When the film was released, one of the company&#39;s magazines, <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Yorker" id="w">The New Yorker</a></i>, ran a review that disparaged the novel in comparison.<sup id="_ref-New Yorker DWP review_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-New Yorker DWP review" title="">[71]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">The New York Times</a><b>s <a href="/wiki/Janet_Maslin" id="w">Janet Maslin</a> avoided mentioning Wintour&#39;s name in one of the paper&#39;s two negative reviews of the book.<sup id="_ref-Maslin DWP review_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Maslin DWP review" title="">[72]</a></sup> Its favorable notice of the movie mentioned neither <i>Vogue</i> nor Wintour.<sup id="_ref-NYT DWP film review_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT DWP film review" title="">[73]</a></sup> </b></i></p>

During production of <a href="/wiki/The_Devil_Wears_Prada_(film)" id="w">the movie</a> in <a href="/wiki/2005_in_film" id="w">2005</a>, Wintour was reportedly pressuring prominent fashion personalities, particularly designers, not to make <a href="/wiki/Cameo_appearance" id="w">cameo appearances</a> in the movie lest they be banished from the magazine&#39;s pages, at least temporarily.<sup id="_ref-Radar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Radar" title="">[74]</a></sup> She denied it through a spokesperson who said she was interested in anything that &#34;supports fashion&#34;.

<p>The film was released, in mid-2006, to great commercial success.<sup id="_ref-boxofficemojo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boxofficemojo" title="">[75]</a></sup> Wintour attended the <a href="/wiki/Premi%C3%A8re" id="w">premiÃ¨re</a> wearing head-to-toe <a href="/wiki/Prada" id="w">Prada</a>. In the film, actress <a href="/wiki/Meryl_Streep" id="w">Meryl Streep</a> plays a Priestly different enough from the book&#39;s to receive critical praise as an entirely original (and more sympathetic) character (although Streep&#39;s office in the film bears similarities striking enough to Wintour&#39;s<sup id="_ref-office photos_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-office photos" title="">[76]</a></sup> that Wintour reportedly had it redecorated).<sup id="_ref-Whitworth_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whitworth" title="">[77]</a></sup></p>

<p>While Wintour may have borne no malice toward the film and those involved in it, she has reportedly never forgiven Weisberger.<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimer328_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimer328" title="">[79]</a></sup> When it was reported that Weisberger&#39;s editor told her to start her third novel over, Wintour&#39;s spokesman suggested she &#34;should get a job as someone else&#39;s assistant.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Lloyd Grove_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lloyd Grove" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i> may have actually done Wintour a favor by increasing her name recognition. &#34;Besides giving Weisberger her fifteen minutes&#34;, Oppenheimer writes, &#34;[it] ... place[d] Anna squarely in the mainstream celebrity pantheon.

<p>While her success at turning <i>Vogue</i> around and her support of the fashion industry and charity work are universally acknowledged, criticism of her management style as depicted by Weisberger has continued.

<p>In 2005, two years after <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>, Oppenheimer&#39;s, <i>Front Row: The Cool Life and Hot Times of Vogue&#39;s Editor In Chief</i> was published.

According to Oppenheimer, Wintour not only declined his requests for an interview but directed others not to cooperate,<sup id="_ref-Oppenheimerxi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oppenheimerxi" title="">[81]</a></sup> consistent with other reports that she goes to great lengths to manage her public image.

<p>She is often described as cold and aloof. &#34;At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became &#39;Anna Wintour&#39;, at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public&#34;, wrote <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" id="w">The Guardian</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-What lies beneath_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-What lies beneath" title="">[66]</a></sup> Many former coworkers told Jerry Oppenheimer of how she kept her distance from most of them.

<a id="Responses" name="Responses"></a><h3>Responses</h3>
<p>Wintour has rarely, if ever, personally responded to criticisms of her, as most critics have been her employees or others with something to gain by remaining in her favor, and have thus spoken anonymously. But there have been a few defenses from other quarters. Amanda Fortini at <i><a href="/wiki/Slate_(magazine)" id="w">Slate</a></i> said she was just fine with Wintour&#39;s elitism since that was intrinsic to fashion and, ultimately, good for the magazine&#39;s readers:

<a href="/wiki/Emma_Brockes" id="w">Emma Brockes</a> sees this in Wintour herself: &#34;[Her] unwavering ability to look as if she lives within the pages of her magazine has a sort of honesty to it, proof that, whatever one thinks about it, the lifestyle peddled by Vogue is at least physically possible&#34;.<sup id="_ref-What lies beneath_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-What lies beneath" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>

<p>Her defenders have charged her critics with <a href="/wiki/Sexism" id="w">sexism</a>. &#34;Powerful women in the media always get inspected more thoroughly than their male counterparts&#34;, said the <i>New York Times</i> in a piece about Wintour shortly after the film&#39;s release.<sup id="_ref-Times Wintour film piece_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Times Wintour film piece" title="">[96]</a></sup> Some of the former have even seen her as a <a href="/wiki/Feminism" id="w">feminist</a> whose changes to <i>Vogue</i> have reflected, acknowledged and reinforced advances in the status of women.
