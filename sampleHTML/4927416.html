<p>The <b>Great American Boycott</b> (known in <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" id="w">Spanish</a> as <b><i>El Gran Paro Estadounidense</i></b>, &#34;the Great American Strike&#34;) was a one-day <a href="/wiki/Boycott" id="w">boycott</a> of <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> schools and businesses by <a href="/wiki/Immigrants" id="w">immigrants</a>, both legal and <a href="/wiki/Illegal_immigration" id="w">non-legal</a>, of mostly <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" id="w">Latin American</a> origin that took place on <a href="/wiki/May_1" id="w">May 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>.  </p>
<p>This date was consciously chosen by boycott organizers to coincide with <a href="/wiki/May_Day" id="w">May Day</a>, the <a href="/wiki/International_Workers_Day" id="w">International Workers Day</a> observed as a national holiday in Asia, most of Europe, and Mexico, but not officially recognized in the United States. </p>
<p>As a continuation of the <a href="/wiki/2006_U.S._immigration_reform_protests" id="w">2006 U.S. immigration reform protests</a>, the organizers called for supporters to abstain from buying, selling, working, and attending school, in order to demonstrate through <a href="/wiki/Direct_action" id="w">direct action</a> the extent to which the labor obtained of unauthorized immigrants is needed for the <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States" id="w">economy of the United States</a>. Supporters of the boycott rallied in major cities across the U.S. to demand general <a href="/wiki/Amnesty" id="w">amnesty</a> and legalization programs for such non-citizens.

Some Americans, particularly members and supporters of legal-immigration and immigration reduction groups, were alarmed{{Fact}} by scenes of thousands of illegal immigrants marching through the streets and demanding laws be changed to legalize their presence in the United States. Some of these groups organized counter-demonstrations in various cities to coincide with the day&#39;s events, although they were mostly insignificant in size.<sup id="_ref-Milwaukee_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milwaukee" title="">[33]</a></sup> Some encouraged their members to buy from American businesses to offset the economic impact of the boycott. Among them are the Southern California <a href="/wiki/Talk_radio" id="w">talk radio</a> hosts <a href="/wiki/John_and_Ken" id="w">John and Ken</a>, who called for &#34;The Great American Spend-a-Lot&#34;, a contest with prizes for listeners who spent the most money.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>

<p>A new group, the &#39;You Don&#39;t Speak For Us&#39; coalition, was formed in response to the boycott to challenge the notion that May 1 protesters speak on behalf of all <a href="/wiki/Latino" id="w">Latinos</a>.
