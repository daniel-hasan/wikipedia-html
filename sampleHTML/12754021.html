<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h2>Background</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_18" id="w">June 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a> Nireah Johnson, 17, and friend Brandie Coleman, 18,  were riding around with another friend.<sup id="_ref-Court_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Court" title="">[1]</a></sup> The trio saw Paul Moore riding in a car driven by Curtis Ward, and asked them to pull into a gas station parking lot. Johnson and Moore got out of their vehicles, talked briefly and exchanged numbers.<sup id="_ref-Court_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Court" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Moore reportedly said he was attracted to Johnson, and believed Johnson was biologically female. Moore later told police that Johnson kissed him on the cheek when they parted, and they agreed to meet later. He denied meeting Johnson at a later date. <sup id="_ref-6News1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6News1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Murder" name="Murder"></a><h3>Murder</h3>
<p>According to court documents,<sup id="_ref-Court_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Court" title="">[1]</a></sup> at 12:51 a.m. on <a href="/wiki/July_23" id="w">July 23</a>, Coleman called Moore&#39;s home to speak with Ward. Coleman and Johnson then drove Coleman&#39;s mother&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Jeep_Grand_Cherokee" id="w">Jeep Grand Cherokee</a> to Moore&#39;s apartment. The four talked outside and then went into the apartment. Ward and Coleman went into Ward&#39;s room, while Moore and Johnson went into Moore&#39;s room. </p>
<p>Moore later entered Ward&#39;s room with a Ruger .45 caliber <a href="/wiki/Handgun" id="w">handgun</a> and asked  to speak with Ward. The two men went into the kitchen, where Moore asked if Ward knew whether Johnson was male or female. The two men went into the living room, where Moore asked Johnson and Coleman whether Johnson was male or female. </p>
<p>When Johnson went to use the bathroom, after forty minutes of discussion, Moore followed and discovered Johnson was biologically male. Moore became upset, and then asked Ward to get some wire. They used the wire to bind Coleman&#39;s and Johnson&#39;s hands behind their backs. Moore put Johnson and Coleman in the back seat of the <a href="/wiki/Jeep_Grand_Cherokee" id="w">Jeep</a>, and told Ward to follow him. </p>
<p>Moore drove the <a href="/wiki/Jeep_Grand_Cherokee" id="w">Jeep</a> to a wooded area in Fall Creek Corridor Park in <a href="/wiki/Indianapolis%2C_Indiana" id="w">Indianapolis</a>. Ward made a U-turn after which Moore entered Ward&#39;s vehicle. Moore then dismantled the handgun and threw the pieces out of the window. The men then returned to Moore&#39;s home.<sup id="_ref-Court_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Court" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>That afternoon, Moore called Ward to suggest they set fire to the jeep. Ward  spoke to Moore&#39;s brother, Charles McGee, who had seen Johnson&#39;s and Coleman&#39;s bodies in the vehicle. McGee and Ward returned to the park that night with a can of gasoline and burned the vehicle containing Johnson&#39;s and Coleman&#39;s bodies.</p>
<a id="Discovery" name="Discovery"></a><h2>Discovery</h2>
<p>Johnson&#39;s and Coleman&#39;s bodies were found later, on the night of <a href="/wiki/July_23" id="w">July 23</a>, when firefighters were alerted to a burning vehicle. They were found lying on the back seat of the Jeep. Their bodies were burned beyond recognition, and investigators were unable to determine the race or gender of either victim. Police treated the deaths as <a href="/wiki/Homicide" id="w">homicides</a>, though they had not yet determined whether the victims has been murdered.<sup id="_ref-IndyChannel2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IndyChannel2" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/July_24" id="w">July 24</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Marion_County%2C_Indiana" id="w">Marion County, Indiana</a> coroner&#39;s office released Johnson&#39;s and Coleman&#39;s names as homicide victims. The coroner&#39;s report said that each had been shot in the forehead before the fire started. Investigators determined that gasoline had been poured into the back seat and ignited.<sup id="_ref-Court_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Court" title="">[1]</a></sup> Authorities were alerted when Coleman&#39;s mother, Mary Coleman recognized the vehicle in news reports, from the <a href="/wiki/FedEx" id="w">FedEx</a> plate on the front. Mary Coleman, who worked at <a href="/wiki/FedEx" id="w">FedEx</a>, called a television station, and the station then contacted the police.<sup id="_ref-IndyStar1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IndyStar1" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
