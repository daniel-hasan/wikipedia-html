<p>The show was created by <a href="/wiki/Tony_Warren" id="w">Tony Warren</a> and is produced by Granada Television, holder of the <a href="/wiki/ITV#Organisation" id="w">ITV franchise</a> for the northwest of England, and was shown by most of the ITV stations then operating (See Scheduling details below). It became fully networked on <a href="/wiki/6_March" id="w">6 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1961" id="w">1961</a>, when <a href="/wiki/Associated_TeleVision" id="w">ATV</a>, the only remaining franchise, began airing it.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-littlepg10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg10" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Coronation Street</i> (commonly nicknamed and written as <i>Corrie</i> or <i>the Street</i>) is set in a fictional street in <a href="/wiki/Weatherfield" id="w">Weatherfield</a>, a fictional suburb of <a href="/wiki/Manchester" id="w">Manchester</a>. The programme focuses on the experiences and driving forces behind the residents of Coronation Street, and examines families and individuals within the community who are of different ages, classes, and social structures.<sup id="_ref-littlepg8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg8" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Coronation Street itself consists of a row of seven early 20th century <a href="/wiki/Terraced_house" id="w">terraced houses</a> on its northern side with a <a href="/wiki/Public_house" id="w">public house</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Rovers_Return_Inn" id="w">Rovers Return Inn</a>, at one end, and a <a href="/wiki/General_store" id="w">corner shop</a> at the other. The southern side of the street consists of a factory, two shop units, a garage and three houses, all constructed in the late 1980s. The programme also incorporates the residents of neighbouring streets, including Rosamund Street, Victoria Street, and Viaduct Street.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The working title of the show was <i>Florizel Street</i>, but a <a href="/wiki/Tea_lady" id="w">tea lady</a> named Agnes remarked that &#34;Florizel&#34; sounded like a brand of disinfectant so the name was changed.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  The choice of new name was between <i>Jubilee Street</i> and <i>Coronation Street</i>, with Granada executives Harry Latham, Harry Elton and <a href="/wiki/H_V_Kershaw" id="w">H.V. Kershaw</a> deciding on the latter.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>As of 2007, <i>Coronation Street</i> is broadcast in the United Kingdom at 19.30 and 20.30 Monday, and at 19.30 Wednesday, Friday and Sunday on terrestrial network <a href="/wiki/ITV" id="w">ITV</a>.

<p>Since 1960, <i>Coronation Street</i> has featured many characters, whose popularity with viewers and critics has differed. The original cast was created by Tony Warren, with the characters of <a href="/wiki/Ena_Sharples" id="w">Ena Sharples</a> (<a href="/wiki/Violet_Carson" id="w">Violet Carson</a>), <a href="/wiki/Elsie_Tanner" id="w">Elsie Tanner</a> (<a href="/wiki/Patricia_Phoenix" id="w">Patricia Phoenix</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Annie_Walker" id="w">Annie Walker</a> (<a href="/wiki/Doris_Speed" id="w">Doris Speed</a>) as central figures.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> These three women remained with the show for 20 years or more, and became <a href="/wiki/Archetype" id="w">archetypes</a> of British soap opera, often being emulated by other serials, with Ena as the street&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Busybody" id="w">busybody</a>, battleaxe and self-proclaimed moral voice;<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Elsie as the <a href="/wiki/Hooker_with_a_heart_of_gold" id="w">tart with a heart</a>, who was constantly hurt by men in the search for true love;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> and Annie Walker, landlady of the <a href="/wiki/Rovers_Return_Inn" id="w">Rovers Return Inn</a>, who had <a href="/wiki/Delusions_of_grandeur" id="w">delusions of grandeur</a> and saw herself as better than other residents of Coronation Street.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>For a number of years, <i>Coronation Street</i> became known for the portrayal of strong female characters,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> with characters like Ena Sharples, Annie Walker, Elsie Tanner and <a href="/wiki/Hilda_Ogden" id="w">Hilda Ogden</a> becoming household names during the 1960s.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>  Tony Warren created a programme that was largely matrifocal, which some commentators put down to the female-dominant environment in which he grew up.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>. As a consequence, the show also has a long tradition of <a href="/wiki/Hen-pecked" id="w">hen-pecked</a> husbands, most famously <a href="/wiki/Stan_Ogden" id="w">Stan Ogden</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jack_Duckworth" id="w">Jack Duckworth</a>, husbands of Hilda and Vera respectively.</p>
<p>Of the characters in the original episodes, only one remains: <a href="/wiki/Ken_Barlow" id="w">Ken Barlow</a> (<a href="/wiki/William_Roache" id="w">William Roache</a>). Barlow entered the storyline as a young radical, reflecting the youth of 1960s Britain, where figures like <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles" id="w">The Beatles</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones" id="w">The Rolling Stones</a>, and the model <a href="/wiki/Twiggy" id="w">Twiggy</a> were to reshape the concept of youthful rebellion. Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off, Ken has remained the constant link throughout 46 years of <i>Coronation Street</i>.

<p>1964 saw the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Stan_Ogden" id="w">Stan</a> and Hilda Ogden, with Hilda (<a href="/wiki/Jean_Alexander" id="w">Jean Alexander</a>) becoming one of the most famous British soap characters of all time. In a 1982 poll, Hilda was voted the fourth most recognizable woman in Britain, after <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Bowes-Lyon" id="w">Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Elizabeth II</a> and <a href="/wiki/Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales" id="w">Diana, Princess of Wales</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>  Hilda&#39;s best-known attributes were her <a href="/wiki/Pinafore" id="w">pinny</a>, hair curlers, and the <a href="/wiki/Mural" id="w">&#34;muriel&#34;</a> in her <a href="/wiki/Living_room" id="w">living room</a> with three &#34;flying&#34; duck ornaments. Hilda Ogden&#39;s final episode on <a href="/wiki/25_December" id="w">25 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1987" id="w">1987</a>, remains the highest-rated episode of <i>Coronation Street</i> ever, with nearly 27 million viewers.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bet Lynch (<a href="/wiki/Julie_Goodyear" id="w">Julie Goodyear</a>) first appeared in 1966, before becoming a regular in 1970, and would go on to become one of the most famous <i>Corrie</i> characters.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Bet stood as the central character of the show from 1987 until departing in 1995, often being dubbed as &#34;Queen of the Street&#34; by the media, and indeed herself.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Coronation Street</i> and its characters often rely heavily on archetypes, with the characterisation of some its current cast based loosely on past characters. <a href="/wiki/Blanche_Hunt" id="w">Blanche Hunt</a> (<a href="/wiki/Maggie_Jones_(actress)" id="w">Maggie Jones</a>) embodies the role of the acid-tongued busybody originally held by Ena Sharples, <a href="/wiki/Sally_Webster" id="w">Sally Webster</a> (<a href="/wiki/Sally_Whittaker" id="w">Sally Whittaker</a>) has grown snobbish, like Annie Walker, and a number of the programme&#39;s female characters mirror the vulnerability of Elsie Tanner and Bet Lynch. Other recurring archetypes include the war veteran (<a href="/wiki/Albert_Tatlock" id="w">Albert Tatlock</a>, <a href="/wiki/Percy_Sugden" id="w">Percy Sugden</a>), the bumbling retail manager (<a href="/wiki/Leonard_Swindley" id="w">Leonard Swindley</a>, Reg Holdsworth, <a href="/wiki/Norris_Cole" id="w">Norris Cole</a>), and the perennial losers (Stan and Hilda Ogden, <a href="/wiki/Jack_Duckworth" id="w">Jack</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vera_Duckworth" id="w">Vera Duckworth</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Les_Battersby-Brown" id="w">Les Battersby-Brown</a>).<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>  However, former archivist and scriptwriter Daran Little cautions against characterising the show as a collection of stereotypes. &#34;Rather, remember that Elsie, Ena and Co. were the first of their kind ever seen on British television.  If later characters are stereotypes, it because they are from the same original mold. It is the hundreds of programmes that have followed which have copied <i>Coronation Street</i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-littlepg7_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg7" title="">[20]</a></sup>

<p>The serial began on <a href="/wiki/9_December" id="w">9 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1960" id="w">1960</a> and was not initially a critical success. Granada Television commissioned only 13 episodes and some inside the company doubted the show would last its planned production run.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> Despite the negativity, viewers were immediately drawn to the serial, won over by <i>Coronation Street<b>s &#39;ordinary&#39; characters.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> The programme also made use of <a href="/wiki/Northern_English" id="w">Northern English</a> language and <a href="/wiki/Dialect" id="w">dialect</a>; affectionate local terms like &#34;eh, chuck?&#34;, &#34;nowt&#34; and &#34;by heck!&#34; became widely heard on British television for the first time.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>Early episodes told the story of student Kenneth Barlow, who had won a place at university and thus found his background something of an embarrassment.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> The character is one of the few to have experienced life &#39;outside&#39; of <i>Coronation Street</i>, and in some ways predicts the growth of <a href="/wiki/Globalization" id="w">globalisation</a> and the decline of similar communities. In a 1961 episode, Barlow declares: &#34;You can&#39;t go on just thinking about your own street these days. We&#39;re living with people on the other side of the world. There&#39;s more to worry about than Elsie Tanner and her boyfriends.&#34;<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<p>Also at the centre of many early stories was Ena Sharples, caretaker of the <a href="/wiki/Glad_Tidings_Mission_Hall" id="w">Glad Tidings Mission Hall</a>, and her friends: timid <a href="/wiki/Minnie_Caldwell" id="w">Minnie Caldwell</a> (<a href="/wiki/Margot_Bryant" id="w">Margot Bryant</a>) and bespectacled <a href="/wiki/Martha_Longhurst" id="w">Martha Longhurst</a> (<a href="/wiki/Lynne_Carol" id="w">Lynne Carol</a>). The trio were likened to the <a href="/wiki/Greek_chorus" id="w">Greek chorus</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Weird_Sisters" id="w">three witches</a> in <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" id="w">William Shakespeare</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Macbeth" id="w">Macbeth</a></i>, as they would sit in the snug bar of the Rovers Return, passing judgement over family, neighbours and frequently each other.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup>  Headstrong Ena often clashed with Elsie Tanner, whom she believed espoused a rather disgusting set of morals. Elsie resented Ena&#39;s interference and gossip, which, most of the time, had little basis in reality.</p>
<p>In September 1961, <i>Coronation Street</i> reached No.1 in the <a href="/wiki/Television_ratings" id="w">television ratings</a> and remained there for the rest of the year.<sup id="_ref-littlepg10_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg10" title="">[3]</a></sup> Earlier in 1961, a Television Audience Measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (15 million) tuned into <i>Corrie</i> and by 1964 the programme had over 20 million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on <a href="/wiki/December_2" id="w">December 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1964" id="w">1964</a>, at 21.36 million viewers.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Storylines throughout the decade included: a mystery poison-pen letter received by Elsie Tanner, the 1962 marriage of Ken Barlow and <a href="/wiki/Valerie_Barlow" id="w">Valerie Tatlock</a>, <a href="/wiki/Storylines_of_Coronation_Street#Killing of Martha Longhurst" id="w">the death of Martha Longhurst</a> in 1964, the birth of the Barlow twins in 1965, Elsie Tanner&#39;s wedding to Steve Tanner as well as a train crashing from the viaduct (both in 1967), the murder of Steve Tanner in 1968, and a coach crash in 1969.</p> 
<p>In spite of rising popularity with viewers, <i>Coronation Street</i> was criticised by some for its outdated portrayal of the urban <a href="/wiki/Working-class" id="w">working-class</a>, and its representation of a community that was a <a href="/wiki/Nostalgia" id="w">nostalgic</a> fantasy.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>  After the first episode in 1960, the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Mirror" id="w">Daily Mirror</a></i> printed: &#34;The programme is doomed from the outset... For there is little reality in this new serial, which apparently, we have to suffer twice a week.&#34;<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup>  By 1967, critics were suggesting that the programme no longer reflected life in 1960s Britain, but reflected how life was in the <i>1950s</i>. Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including drugs, sex, homosexuality and out of wedlock pregnancy, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

The show&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Production_team" id="w">production team</a> was tested when many core cast members left the programme in the early 1970s. When Arthur Leslie died suddenly in 1970, his character, Rovers landlord Jack Walker, died with him.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Anne_Reid" id="w">Anne Reid</a> quit as Valerie Barlow, and was killed off in 1971, electrocuting herself with a faulty hairdryer.<sup id="_ref-littlepg73_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg73" title="">[33]</a></sup> Ratings reached a low of 8 million in February 1973, Pat Phoenix quit as Elsie Tanner, Violet Carson (Ena Sharples) was written out for most of the year due to illness, and Doris Speed (Annie Walker) took two months’ leave.<sup id="_ref-littlepg86_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg86" title="">[34]</a></sup> ITV daytime soap <i><a href="/wiki/Crossroads_(TV_series)" id="w">Crossroads</a></i> saw a marked increase in viewers at this time, as its established cast, such as Meg Richardson (<a href="/wiki/Noele_Gordon" id="w">Noele Gordon</a>), grew in popularity.<sup id="_ref-littlepg86_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg86" title="">[34]</a></sup> These sudden departures forced the writing team to quickly develop characters who had previously stood in the background.

<p>The 1970s was also the decade when <i>Coronation Street</i> began to include more comedy in its storylines, at the insistence of new producer <a href="/wiki/Bill_Podmore" id="w">Bill Podmore</a> who joined in 1976, having worked on Granada comedy productions prior to his appointment.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> Stan and Hilda Ogden were often at the centre of overtly funny story lines, with other comic characters including <a href="/wiki/Eddie_Yeats" id="w">Eddie Yeats</a> (<a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Hughes" id="w">Geoffrey Hughes</a>), <a href="/wiki/Fred_Gee" id="w">Fred Gee</a> (<a href="/wiki/Fred_Feast" id="w">Fred Feast</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Jack_Duckworth" id="w">Jack Duckworth</a> (<a href="/wiki/William_Tarmey" id="w">William Tarmey</a>) all making their first appearances during the decade.

In 1976, Pat Phoenix returned to her role as Elsie Tanner and, after a spate of ill health, Violet Carson returned as Ena.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> <i>Coronation Street&#39;s</i> stalwart cast slotted back into the programme alongside the newcomers, examining new relationships between characters of different ages and backgrounds: Eddie Yeats became the Ogdens&#39; lodger, Gail Potter and <a href="/wiki/Suzie_Birchall" id="w">Suzie Birchall</a> moved in with Elsie, <a href="/wiki/Mike_Baldwin" id="w">Mike Baldwin</a> (<a href="/wiki/Johnny_Briggs_(actor)" id="w">Johnny Briggs</a>) arrived in 1976 as the tough factory boss, and Annie Walker reigned at the Rovers with her trio of staff Bet Lynch, <a href="/wiki/Betty_Driver" id="w">Betty Turpin</a> and Fred Gee.</p>
<p>Storylines throughout the decade included: a warehouse fire in 1975, the birth of <a href="/wiki/Tracy_Barlow" id="w">Tracy Langton</a> in 1977, the murder of <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Bishop" id="w">Ernest Bishop</a> in 1978, a lorry crashing into the Rovers Return in 1979, and the marriage of <a href="/wiki/Brian_Tilsley" id="w">Brian Tilsley</a> and Gail Potter (also in 1979).</p>
<p><i>Coronation Street</i> had little competition within its prime time slot, and certain critics suggested that the programme had grown complacent, moving away from socially-viable story lines and again presenting a dated view of working-class life.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>

<p>Between 1980 and 1989, <i>Coronation Street</i> underwent some of the biggest changes since its launch. By May 1984, Ken Barlow stood as the only original <a href="/wiki/Cast_member" id="w">cast member</a>, after the departures of Ena Sharples (in 1980), Annie Walker (in 1983), Elsie Tanner (in 1984) and <a href="/wiki/Albert_Tatlock" id="w">Albert Tatlock</a> (also 1984).<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> In 1983, <a href="/wiki/Antihero" id="w">antihero</a> <a href="/wiki/Len_Fairclough" id="w">Len Fairclough</a> (<a href="/wiki/Peter_Adamson" id="w">Peter Adamson</a>), one of the show&#39;s central male characters since 1961, was killed off, and in 1984, <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Youens" id="w">Bernard Youens</a> (Stan Ogden) died.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> While the press predicted the end of <i>Corrie</i>, H.V.

<p>The arrival of <a href="/wiki/Channel_4" id="w">Channel 4</a> and its edgy new serial <i><a href="/wiki/Brookside" id="w">Brookside</a></i> in 1982 was one of the biggest changes for <i>Coronation Street</i>, as well as the <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a>&#39;s new prime time soap opera, <i><a href="/wiki/EastEnders" id="w">EastEnders</a></i> in 1985.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> While ratings for <i>Coronation Street</i> remained consistent throughout the decade, <i>EastEnders</i> regularly obtained higher viewing figures.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup>  With prime time competition, <i>Corrie</i> was again seen as being old fashioned, with the introduction of the &#39;normal&#39; Clayton family in 1985 being failure with viewers.<sup id="_ref-littlepg165_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg165" title="">[51]</a></sup> Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer, David Liddiment. A new exterior set had been built in 1982 and in 1989 it was redeveloped to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed, with a new studio being built and the inclusion of more location filming, which had moved from being shot on <a href="/wiki/Film" id="w">film</a> to <a href="/wiki/Videotape" id="w">videotape</a> in 1988.<sup id="_ref-littlepg188_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg188" title="">[52]</a></sup>  New pressures also saw introduction of the third weekly episode on <a href="/wiki/20_October" id="w">20 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1989" id="w">1989</a>, broadcast each Friday at 19:30.<sup id="_ref-littlepg188_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg188" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>

<a id="1990s" name="1990s"></a><h2>1990s</h2>
<p>In spite of updated sets and production changes, <i>Coronation Street</i> still received criticism. In 1992, chairman of the <a href="/wiki/Ofcom" id="w">Broadcasting Standards Council</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lord_Rees-Mogg" id="w">Lord Rees-Mogg</a>, criticised the low-representation of <a href="/wiki/Minority_group" id="w">ethnic minorities</a> and the programme&#39;s portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era. Some newspapers ran headlines such as <b>Coronation Street<i> shuts out blacks&#39; (</i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" id="w">The Times</a><i>) and &#39;Put colour in t&#39;Street&#39; (</i>Daily Mirror<i>).<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup>   Patrick Stoddart of </i>The Times<i> wrote: &#34;The millions who watch </i>Coronation Street<i> – and who will continue to do so despite Lord Rees-Mogg – know real life when they see it […] in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen&#34;.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> Black and Asian characters had appeared, but it wasn&#39;t until 1999 that show featured its first regular non-white family, the Desai family.</i></b></p>

<p>Storylines in the early part of the decade included: the death of newborn Katie McDonald in 1992, Mike Baldwin&#39;s wedding to Alma Sedgewick (<a href="/wiki/Amanda_Barrie" id="w">Amanda Barrie</a>) in 1992, Tommy Duckworth being sold by his father Terry in 1993, Deirdre Barlow&#39;s marriage to Moroccan Samir Rachid, and the rise of <a href="/wiki/Tanya_Pooley" id="w">Tanya Pooley</a> (<a href="/wiki/Eva_Pope" id="w">Eva Pope</a>) between 1993 and 1994.

In 1997, Brian Park took over as producer, with the idea of promoting young characters as opposed to the older cast. On his first day he axed the characters of <a href="/wiki/Derek_Wilton" id="w">Derek Wilton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Don_Brennan_(Coronation_Street_Character)" id="w">Don Brennan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Percy_Sugden" id="w">Percy Sugden</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bill_Webster" id="w">Bill Webster</a>, Billy Williams and <a href="/wiki/Maureen_Holdsworth" id="w">Maureen Holdsworth</a>.<sup id="_ref-littlepg235_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg235" title="">[60]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Thelma_Barlow" id="w">Thelma Barlow</a>, who played Derek&#39;s wife Mavis, was angered by the sacking of her co-star and resigned, while the production team also lost some of its key writers when Barry Hill, Adele Rose and Julian Roach all resigned.<sup id="_ref-littlepg235_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg235" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>

<p>Viewers were alienated by the new-look <i>Coronation Street</i>, and the media voiced disapproval. Having received criticism of being too out of touch, <i>Corrie</i> now struggled to emulate the more modern <i>Brookside</i> and <i>EastEnders</i>. In the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Mirror" id="w">Daily Mirror</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Victor_Lewis-Smith" id="w">Victor Lewis-Smith</a> wrote: &#34;Apparently it doesn&#39;t matter that this is a first-class soap opera, superbly scripted and flawlessly performed by a seasoned repertory company.&#34;<sup id="_ref-littlepg235_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg235" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of <i>Coronation Street<b>s best known storylines took place in 1998, with <a href="/wiki/Deirdre_Barlow" id="w">Deirdre Rachid</a> being wrongfully imprisoned after a relationship with con-man Jon Lindsay. 19 million viewers watched Deirdre being sent to prison, and &#39;Free the Weatherfield One&#39; campaigns sprung up in a media frenzy.<sup id="_ref-little241_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-little241" title="">[61]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair" id="w">Tony Blair</a> even passed comment on Deirdre’s sentencing in Parliament.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> Deirdre was freed after three weeks, with Granada stating that they had always intended for her to be released, in spite of the media interest.<sup id="_ref-little241_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-little241" title="">[61]</a></sup></b></i></p>

<p>From 1999-2001, Jane MacNaught was <i>Coronation Street&#39;s</i> executive producer, and received harsh criticism from both viewers and critics. In an attempt to compete with <i>EastEnders</i>, issue-led story lines were introduced such as <a href="/wiki/Toyah_Battersby" id="w">Toyah Battersby</a>&#39;s rape, Roy and Hayley Cropper abducting their <a href="/wiki/Foster_care" id="w">foster child</a>, Sarah Platt&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Chat_room" id="w">Internet chat room</a> abduction and <a href="/wiki/Alma_Baldwin" id="w">Alma Halliwell</a>&#39;s death of <a href="/wiki/Cervical_cancer" id="w">cervical cancer</a>.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> Such storylines were unpopular with viewers and ratings dropped and in October 2001, Macnaught was abruptly moved to another Granada department and Carolyn Reynolds took over. <i>Corrie</i> continued to struggle in the ratings, with <i>EastEnders</i> introducing some of its strongest stories. In 2002, Kieran Roberts was appointed as producer and aimed to re-introduce &#34;gentle story lines and humour&#34;, after deciding that <i>the Street</i> shouldn&#39;t try and compete with other soaps.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>

In 2002, one of <i>Coronation Street&#39;s</i> best-known storylines began, which culminated in 2003.

The storyline received wide press attention, and viewing figures peaked at 19.4 million, with Hillman dubbed a &#34;serial killer&#34; by the media.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup>  </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Todd_Grimshaw" id="w">Todd Grimshaw</a> began to question his sexuality in 2003, becoming <i>Corrie&#39;s</i> first regular homosexual character, after years of criticism about non-representation.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> The character of <a href="/wiki/Karen_McDonald" id="w">Karen McDonald</a> (<a href="/wiki/Suranne_Jones" id="w">Suranne Jones</a>) was developed, with her fiery marriage to Steve and warring with <a href="/wiki/Tracy_Barlow" id="w">Tracy Barlow</a>.

<p>In 2004, <i>Coronation Street</i> <a href="/wiki/Retconned" id="w">retconned</a> the Baldwin family when Mike&#39;s nephew <a href="/wiki/Danny_Baldwin" id="w">Danny Baldwin</a> and his wife Frankie moved to the area from Essex, with their two sons Jamie and Warren. Until this time, Mike Baldwin had been portrayed as an <a href="/wiki/Only_child" id="w">only child</a>, with his father appearing in the programme between 1980 and 1982 confirming the fact.</p>
<p>During the decade, a range of other storylines featured, such as the <a href="/wiki/Bigamy" id="w">bigamy</a> of <a href="/wiki/Peter_Barlow_(Coronation_Street)" id="w">Peter Barlow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maya_Sharma" id="w">Maya Sharma</a>&#39;s revenge on former lover <a href="/wiki/Dev_Alahan" id="w">Dev Alahan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Katy_Harris" id="w">Katy Harris</a> murdering her father and subsequently committing suicide, Charlie Stubbs&#39;s psychological abuse of <a href="/wiki/Shelley_Unwin" id="w">Shelley Unwin</a>, and the deaths of <a href="/wiki/Mike_Baldwin" id="w">Mike Baldwin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fred_Elliott" id="w">Fred Elliott</a>.

The Connor family were central to many storylines at the beginning of 2007 - an accidental death at Underworld due to overworking, <a href="/wiki/Michelle_Connor" id="w">Michelle Connor</a>&#39;s discovery that her brothers <a href="/wiki/Paul_Connor" id="w">Paul</a> and <a href="/wiki/Liam_Connor" id="w">Liam</a> were the cause of her husband&#39;s death, Paul&#39;s use of an escort service, and his kidnapping of Leanne and subsequent death. </p>
<p>Many big names left in 2007. In January, Charlie Stubbs was killed by vengeful girlfriend <a href="/wiki/Tracy_Barlow" id="w">Tracy Barlow</a>. In summer 2007, actress <a href="/wiki/Liz_Dawn" id="w">Liz Dawn</a> told producers that she wanted to retire her character <a href="/wiki/Vera_Duckworth" id="w">Vera Duckworth</a> because her <a href="/wiki/Emphysema" id="w">emphysema</a> was restricting her acting and movement.

<p>Transmitted in black and white for the majority of the 1960s, preparations were made to film episode 923 (transmitted Wednesday <a href="/wiki/October_29" id="w">October 29</a> <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a>), which featured the street residents on a coach trip to the Lake District, in colour. In the event, suitable colour stock for the film cameras could not be found and the episode was made in black and white. The following episode, transmitted Monday <a href="/wiki/November_3" id="w">November 3</a>, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like <a href="/wiki/BBC1" id="w">BBC1</a>, the ITV network was broadcast in black and white at this point so viewers noticed nothing unusual. The reasons why episodes were made in colour for monochrome transmission are not stated in any literature but it is possible that it was for the purposes of testing the look of sets and costumes using the new cameras. Certainly one set (that of the Rovers Return) undergoes a subtle change of colours in November 1969 without any on-screen explanation.</p>
<p>Daran Little, for many years the official programme archivist, claims that the first episode to be transmitted in colour was episode 930 shown on Monday <a href="/wiki/November_24" id="w">November 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a><sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> however the ITV network, like <a href="/wiki/BBC1" id="w">BBC1</a>, began full colour transmissions on Saturday <a href="/wiki/November_15" id="w">November 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a> and it is therefore possible that the first transmitted colour episode is number 928 shown on Monday <a href="/wiki/November_17" id="w">November 17</a>. In October 1970 a long-simmering technician&#39;s dispute turned into a <a href="/wiki/Work-to-rule" id="w">work-to-rule</a> when sound staff were denied a pay rise given to camera staff the year before for working with colour recording equipment. The terms of the work to rule were that staff refused to work with the new equipment and therefore programmes had to be recorded and transmitted in black and white, including <i>Coronation Street</i><sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> The dispute was resolved in early 1971 and the last black and white episode aired on <a href="/wiki/8_February" id="w">8 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1971" id="w">1971</a>.</p>

As befitting the soap-opera genre, <i>Coronation Street</i> is made up of individual housing units, plus communal areas: a newsagent&#39;s (<i><a href="/wiki/The_Kabin" id="w">The Kabin</a></i>), a small café (<i>Roy&#39;s Rolls</i>), a general grocery shop (<i>D&#38;S Alahan&#39;s</i>), a factory (<i><a href="/wiki/Underworld_(Knickers)" id="w">Underworld</a></i>) and a public house, the <i>Rovers Return Inn</i>, which is the main meeting place for characters on the programme.<sup id="_ref-littlepg73_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlepg73" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>From 1960–1968, all interactions on the &#39;outside&#39; street were filmed on a sound stage, with the houses reduced in scale by 3/4 and constructed from wood.<sup id="_ref-tinkerpg95_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tinkerpg95" title="">[83]</a></sup> In 1968, Granada built an outside set which was not all that different from the interior version previously used, with the wooden façades from the studio simply being erected on the new site.<sup id="_ref-tinkerpg95_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tinkerpg95" title="">[83]</a></sup></p>

Granada produced two series of the spin-off, which ended in 1966.<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup>                           </p>

<a href="/wiki/Cadburys" id="w">Cadburys</a> was the first <a href="/wiki/Sponsorship" id="w">sponsor</a> of <i>Coronation Street</i> beginning in <a href="/wiki/July" id="w">July</a> <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a>. In the Summer of 2006 <a href="/wiki/Cadbury_Trebor_Bassett" id="w">Cadbury Trebor Bassetts</a> had to recall over 1 million chocolate bars, due to suspected salmonella contamination, and <i>Coronation Street</i> stopped the sponsorship for several months.  In late 2006 Cadbury did not renew their contract, but agreed to sponsor the show until <i>Coronation Street</i> found a new sponsor. On <a href="/wiki/16_September" id="w">16 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, the Cadbury sponsor adverts aired for the last time.</p>
<p>In July <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> an ITV press release announced that Harveys (a furniture superstore) was the new sponsor of <i>Coronation Street</i> on the ITV Network. Harveys&#39; sponsorship began on <a href="/wiki/30_September" id="w">30 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.</p>
