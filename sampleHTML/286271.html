<p>The <b>Green Party of Canada</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canadian</a> federal <a href="/wiki/Political_party" id="w">political party</a> founded in <a href="/wiki/1983_in_Canada" id="w">1983</a>. With around 9,000 registered members as of November 2007,{{Fact}} the Greens are the largest federal party in Canada without representation in <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada" id="w">Parliament</a>. The Greens, as their name indicates, advocate <a href="/wiki/Green_politics" id="w">green politics</a> and are the largest party in Canada to focus primarily on green politics, though other parties have included environmental stances in their platforms.</p>
<p>The party&#39;s support has ranged between 4.5% and 15% since the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006" id="w">2006 federal election</a> and has not polled below 6% in any opinion poll in 2007.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> In mid-November 2007 the Greens placed third ahead of both the Bloc and the NDP in a Strategic Counsel poll.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> In the 2006 election, the Green Party of Canada received 4.5% of the total vote but did not win any seats.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_May" id="w">Elizabeth May</a> is the current leader of the party. She was elected on the first ballot by 65% of voting party members on <a href="/wiki/August_26" id="w">August 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> History </h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>About one month before the 1980 federal election, eleven candidates, mostly from ridings in the Atlantic provinces, issued a joint press release declaring that they were running on a common platform. It called for a transition to a non-nuclear, conserver society. Although they ran as independents, they unofficially used the name &#34;Small Party&#34; as part of their declaration of unity - a reference to the &#34;small is beautiful&#34; philosophy of E. F. Schumacher. This was the most substantial early attempt to answer the call for an ecologically-oriented Canadian political party. A key organizer was Elizabeth May who is now leader of the Greens.</p>
<p>The Green Party of Canada was founded at a conference held at Carleton University in Ottawa in 1983. Under its first leader, Dr. <a href="/wiki/Trevor_Hancock" id="w">Trevor Hancock</a>, the party ran 60 candidates in the <a href="/wiki/1984_Canadian_federal_election" id="w">1984 Canadian federal election</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Green Party of Canada is independent of other green parties around the world however all Green parties share the same philosophy. Its provincial counterparts in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia, supports green economics, progressive social planning and responsible and accountable governance.</p>
<p>The Quebec wing hosted the 1990 Canadian Greens conference in Montreal. But soon after that, Canada&#39;s constitutional problems interfered, and many Quebec candidates abandoned the Greens in favour of a Quebec sovereigntist party, the <a href="/wiki/Bloc_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois" id="w">Bloc Québécois</a>. There were only six Green candidates from Quebec in the 1993 election. In the spring of 1996, although the hopes of electing a representative to the BC legislature proved premature, Andy Shadrack in the interior of the province received over 11% of the vote. Overall, the party&#39;s proportion of the popular vote surged to a new high. Shadrack was also the most popular Green candidate in the 1997 federal election, scoring over 6% of the popular vote in <a href="/wiki/West_Kootenay-Okanagan" id="w">West Kootenay-Okanagan</a>.</p>
<a id="Joan_Russow_years" name="Joan_Russow_years"></a><h3>Joan Russow years</h3>

<p>British Columbia&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Joan_Russow" id="w">Joan Russow</a> became leader of the Green Party of Canada on <a href="/wiki/April_13" id="w">April 13</a><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-aff_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aff" title="">[6]</a></sup>, <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>. Russow won 52% of the ballots cast in the 1997 leadership race, surpassing Ontario&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Jim_Harris" id="w">Jim Harris</a> (39%) and <a href="/wiki/Rachelle_Small" id="w">Rachelle Small</a> (8%). Immediately upon attaining the leadership, Russow was plunged into a federal general election.<sup id="_ref-aff_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aff" title="">[6]</a></sup>. Russow&#39;s campaign in 1997 set a number of important precedents. <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1997" id="w">1997 federal election</a> was the first campaign in which the Greens conducted a national leader&#39;s tour, presented a national platform and a bilingual campaign. Previous campaigns, due in part to the party&#39;s few resources and, in part, to the party&#39;s constitutional straitjacket, had been characterized by policy and spokespeople operating, at best, province-by-province and, at worst, riding-by-riding. In her own riding of <a href="/wiki/Victoria" id="w">Victoria</a>, Russow received just shy of 3000 votes and 6% of the popular vote.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the party has been developing as an organization, expanding its membership and improving its showing at the polls. In the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2000" id="w">2000 federal election</a>, the party fielded 111 candidates, up from 78 in 1997.</p>
<p>Candidates were not run in <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador" id="w">Newfoundland and Labrador</a>, as a result of ongoing divisions over Joan Russow&#39;s refusal to endorse the Green candidate in an earlier St. John&#39;s West by-election. (The candidate in question supported the seal hunt and mining development, as most locals did.) <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> This caused much uncertainty and friction between Newfoundland&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Terra_Nova_Green_Party" id="w">Terra Nova Green Party</a> <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Association and the Green Party leader as the party gradually adapted to the realities of functioning as a true national party rather than a disorganized federation of local activists.</p>
<p>The conflicts left Russow isolated and alienated from most members of the party. Volunteer efforts were substantially absorbed in provincial campaigns between 2001 and 2003, and the federal party became dormant between elections, as was typical in the past. <a href="/wiki/Chris_Bradshaw" id="w">Chris Bradshaw</a> served the party as interim leader from 2001 to February 2003.</p>
<a id="Breakthrough" name="Breakthrough"></a><h3>Breakthrough</h3>

<p>In February 2003, Jim Harris, in his second bid for the leadership, defeated <a href="/wiki/John_Grogan" id="w">John Grogan</a> of <a href="/wiki/Valemount" id="w">Valemount</a>, <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jason_Crummey" id="w">Jason Crummey</a>. Crummey was originally from Newfoundland and involved with <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador_Terra_Nova_Greens" id="w">Newfoundland and Labrador Terra Nova Greens</a>.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2004" id="w">2004 federal election</a> the Green Party of Canada made history when it became only the fourth federal political party ever to run candidates in all 308 ridings. When the ballots were counted, the Green Party secured 4.3 percent of the popular vote, thereby surpassing the 2 percent threshold required for party financing under new <a href="/wiki/Elections_Canada" id="w">Elections Canada</a> rules.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Momentum continued to build around the Green Party of Canada and in the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006" id="w">2006 federal election</a> the Green Party again ran 308 candidates and increased its share of the popular vote to 4.5 percent, once again securing federal financing as a result.</p>
<p>The party&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006" id="w">2006 election campaign</a> was disrupted by allegations made by Matthew Pollesell, the party&#39;s former assistant national organizer, that Harris had not filed a proper accounting of money spent during his 2004 leadership campaign, as required by law. Pollesell issued a request that Elections Canada investigate. Pollesell and another former party member, <a href="/wiki/Gretchen_Schwarz" id="w">Gretchen Schwarz</a>, were subsequently warned by the party&#39;s legal counsel to retract allegations they had made or face a possible legal action. <a href="/wiki/Dana_Miller" id="w">Dana Miller</a>, who served in the party&#39;s shadow cabinet with responsibility for human-rights issues, made public her earlier complaints that the party has violated election law and its own constitution and has also asked for an Elections Canada investigation. Miller was expelled from the party after filing a complaint within the party in April.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Policies" name="Policies"></a><h2> Policies </h2>
<p>The GPC had originally adopted a form of the <a href="/wiki/Ten_Key_Values_of_the_US_Green_Party" id="w">Ten Key Values</a> originally authored by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Green_Party" id="w">United States Green Party</a>.</p>
<p>The August 2002 Convention adopted the <a href="/wiki/Six_Principles" id="w">Six Principles</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Global_Greens_Charter" id="w">Charter</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Global_Greens" id="w">Global Greens</a>, as stated by the Global Greens Conference held in Canberra, Australia in 2001. These principles are the only ones included in the GPC constitution.</p>
<p>An emphasis on a <a href="/wiki/Green_tax_shift" id="w">green tax shift</a> in the 2004 platform, which favoured partially reducing income and corporate taxes (while increasing taxes on polluters and energy consumers), created questions as to whether the Green Party was still <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" id="w">on the left</a> of the political spectrum, or was taking a more <a href="/wiki/Eco-capitalist" id="w">eco-capitalist</a> approach by reducing <a href="/wiki/Progressive_taxation" id="w">progressive taxation</a> in favour of <a href="/wiki/Regressive_taxation" id="w">regressive taxation</a>. Green Party policy writers have challenged this interpretation by claiming that any unintended &#34;regressive&#34; tax consequences from the application of a Green Tax Shift would be intentionally offset by changes in individual tax rates and categories as well as an &#39;eco-tax&#34; refund for those who pay no tax. </p>
<p>As early as 2000, the party had published platform comparisons indicating the reasons why supporters of any of the five other Canadian federal political parties should consider voting Green. The Greens have always had right-wing, leftist and centrist factions that have been ascendant at different times in the party&#39;s history. Many Greens also claim that this traditional left-right political spectrum analysis does not accurately capture the pragmatic ecological orientation of an evolving Green Party.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ecumenical approach (expressing affinities with all Canadian political tendencies and making cases to voters on all parts of the left-right spectrum) has been advocated by those who believe their success can be measured by the degree to which other parties adopt Green Party policies. It has however not been discerned the degree to which this process has contributed to phenomena like the Liberal Party of Canada adopting several key items which also appear in the Green program, such as accelerated <a href="/wiki/Capital_Cost_Allowance" id="w">Capital Cost Allowance</a> deductions restricted to <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_technology" id="w">sustainable technology</a> only, and the adoption of the <a href="/wiki/Ecological_and_social_indicator" id="w">ecological and social indicators</a> and <a href="/wiki/Green_procurement" id="w">green procurement</a> rules Greens have long advocated. Neither have the relative degrees of influence been discerned which non-partisan environmental groups and the party&#39;s own Green wing have in developing the policies of the Green Party.</p>
<p>Under Elizabeth May&#39;s leadership, the Green Party has begun to receive more mainstream media attention on other party policy not directly related to the environment - for example, supporting labour rights<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> and poppy legalization in <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" id="w">Afghanistan</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Green Party fielded candidates in all 308 of the nation&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Electoral_district_(Canada)" id="w">ridings</a> in the last two federal elections. In the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006" id="w">2006 federal election</a>, the Green Party received 4.5% of the popular vote, only slightly more than in 2004, despite having received public funding (over $1 million <a href="/wiki/Canadian_dollar" id="w">CAD</a> per year) for the first time and receiving more media coverage.</p>
<p>No Green Party candidate has yet been elected to the federal or provincial level of government in Canada. Members of the party have achieved municipal offices, though most were elected as individuals and not on Green Party slates or labels in local (at least officially) non-partisan municipal elections. However, some people have been elected with a Green Party affiliation identified directly on the ballot. The first two were elected in the 1999 municipal elections (20 November 1999):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Art Vanden Berg, elected as a City Councillor in Victoria, British Columbia, and</li>
<li>Roslyn Cassells, elected to the Vancouver Parks Board on the same day.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> </li></ul>

<a id="Exclusion_from_debates" name="Exclusion_from_debates"></a><h3> Exclusion from debates </h3>
<p>In the 2004 election, the consortium of Canadian television networks did not invite Jim Harris to the televised <a href="/wiki/Leaders_debate" id="w">leaders debates</a>. The primary reason given for this was the party&#39;s lack of representation in the House of Commons. There were unsuccessful legal actions by the party, a petition by its supporters to have it included, and statements by non-supporters such as <a href="/wiki/Ed_Broadbent" id="w">Ed Broadbent</a> who believed it should be included.</p>
<p>The Green Party was also not included in the leaders&#39; debates for the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006" id="w">2006 election</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> The same reason was given<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>, although some also believed the party&#39;s lack of visibility and meaningful input into Canadian federal budgets and bills was a factor. </p>
<p>The Green Party continues to campaign for these measures.</p>

<p>While the organizing and election planning was centralized, policy development was to be decentralized. In February 2004, the <a href="/wiki/Green_Party_of_Canada_Living_Platform" id="w">Green Party of Canada Living Platform</a> was initiated by the Party&#39;s former Head of Platform and Research, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Pilling" id="w">Michael Pilling</a>, to open the party&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Participatory_democracy" id="w">participatory democracy</a> to the public to help validate its policies against broad public input. It also made it easy for candidates to share their answers to public interest group questionnaires, find the best answers to policy questions, and for even rural and remote users, and Canadians abroad, to contribute to Party policy intelligence.</p>
<a id="Membership_exclusions" name="Membership_exclusions"></a><h2> Membership exclusions </h2>
<p>In 1998, the party adopted a rule that forbids membership in any other federal political party. This was intended to prevent the party from being taken over. </p>
<p>In the past, some Green Party members have been comfortable openly working with members of other political parties. For instance, GPC members <a href="/wiki/Peter_Bevan-Baker" id="w">Peter Bevan-Baker</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mike_Nickerson" id="w">Mike Nickerson</a> worked with Liberal MP <a href="/wiki/Joe_Jordan_(politician)" id="w">Joe Jordan</a> to develop the <a href="/wiki/Canada_Well-Being_Measurement_Act" id="w">Canada Well-Being Measurement Act</a> that called upon the government to implement <a href="/wiki/Genuine_Progress_Indicator" id="w">Genuine Progress Indicators</a> (GPI). While the act was introduced into the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons" id="w">House of Commons</a> as a private members bill, it never became law.  A small number of Greens who advocate the more cooperative approach to legislation object to the new rule not to hold cross-memberships, a tool they occasionally employed.</p>

<p>In 2005, some members of the Green Party of Canada who disagreed with what they considered to be the right-wing direction taken by leader <a href="/wiki/Jim_Harris_(politician)" id="w">Jim Harris</a> founded the Peace and Ecology Party of Canada.  This left-wing political party was devoted to issues such as labour, the environment, and bioregionalism.  The party was never registered with <a href="/wiki/Elections_Canada" id="w">Elections Canada</a>, and did not run candidates in the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006" id="w">2006 federal election</a>.

<p>With <a href="/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Dion" id="w">Stéphane Dion</a> winning the Liberal leadership on a largely environmentalist platform, and both the Liberals and Greens having a shared interested in both defeating the Conservatives, whose environmental policies have come under criticism from members of both parties, some political observers questioned if an alliance of some sort between the two parties might take place. </p>
<p>When May made the announcement that she would run in <a href="/wiki/Central_Nova" id="w">Central Nova</a>, currently held by <a href="/wiki/Peter_MacKay" id="w">Peter MacKay</a>, local Liberals would &#34;neither confirm nor deny&#34; that they had had discussions with May over ways to de-seat MacKay.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> On March 21st, Dion said, &#34;Madame May and I have conversations about how we may work together to be sure that this government will stop to do so much harm to our environment&#34;. The speculation was confirmed when Dion and May agreed not to run candidates in each other&#39;s ridings. <sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>May earlier attempted to broker a deal with the NDP, by contacting <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Lewis" id="w">Stephen Lewis</a> to set up a meeting with party leader <a href="/wiki/Jack_Layton" id="w">Jack Layton</a>, who both rejected the notion outright. When the May-Dion deal was announced, it was criticized by the Conservatives and NDP.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup>
