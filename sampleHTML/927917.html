<p>{{nihongo}} is a 26-episode <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a> <a href="/wiki/Television_series" id="w">television series</a> produced in <a href="/wiki/2004_in_television" id="w">2004</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Bee_Train" id="w">Bee Train</a> animation studio. <a href="/wiki/K%C5%8Dichi_Mashimo" id="w">Kōichi Mashimo</a> directed <i>Madlax</i> and the <a href="/wiki/Soundtrack" id="w">soundtrack</a> was composed by <a href="/wiki/Yuki_Kajiura" id="w">Yuki Kajiura</a>. The <a href="/wiki/DVD" id="w">DVD</a> version was released in <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> by <a href="/wiki/ADV_Films" id="w">ADV Films</a>, and in <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a> by <a href="/wiki/Madman_Entertainment" id="w">Madman Entertainment</a>. As of November 2006, the series airs on the <a href="/wiki/Anime_Network" id="w">Anime Network</a> channel. According to the director Mashimo, the title is a <a href="/wiki/Portmanteau" id="w">portmanteau</a> of two English words: <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Mad">MAD</a></i> and <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Relax">reLAXed</a></i>, mirroring the authors&#39; intention to portray the two extremes of human being.<sup id="_ref-Wong_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wong" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DVDTalk_rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DVDTalk_rev" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The story revolves around two young women who seemingly have little in common and do not know of the other&#39;s existence, at first. The titular Madlax is a legend amongst the mercenaries and assassins of the fictional <a href="/wiki/Civil_war" id="w">civil war</a>-torn country of Gazth-Sonika. &#34;Madlax&#34; is a <a href="/wiki/Code_name" id="w">code name</a> and a substitute for her real one, forgotten along with the rest of her past before 1999, when the war started. The other protagonist is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy aristocratic family in the peaceful <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">European</a> country of Nafrece.  Twelve years before the story begins, an airliner her mother and she were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret&#39;s father who lead the rescuers, have been missing ever since. Margaret managed to travel back to Nafrece on her own, though how she made it remains a mystery considering that she too has lost her memories prior to her return; the only thing she recalls is a single word, &#34;Madlax&#34;.  With this thread linking the two girls, they both independently start investigating the powerful <a href="/wiki/Crime_syndicate" id="w">crime syndicate</a> Enfant and its enigmatic mastermind who, for some reason, shows interest in both of them. </p>
<p>Multiple similarities between <i>Madlax</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Noir_(anime)" id="w">Noir</a></i>, an earlier work by Bee Train, have been pointed out.<sup id="_ref-AJ_V1_rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AJ_V1_rev" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ANN_V1_rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN_V1_rev" title="">[4]</a></sup> According to the authors, these two series are the first installments of a <a href="/wiki/Trilogy" id="w">trilogy</a> exploring the so-called <a href="/wiki/Girls-with-guns" id="w">girls-with-guns</a> genre,<sup id="_ref-Wong_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wong" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-GWG_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GWG" title="">[5]</a></sup> with the third title being <i><a href="/wiki/El_Cazador_de_la_Bruja" id="w">El Cazador de la Bruja</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-ANS_EC_news_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANS_EC_news" title="">[6]</a></sup> Still, <i>Madlax</i> differs considerably from its predecessor in its less episodic and more plot-driven style.<sup id="_ref-DV_V2_rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DV_V2_rev" title="">[7]</a></sup>  In particular contrast to the predominantly <a href="/wiki/Realism_(arts)" id="w">realistic</a> <i>Noir</i>, <i>Madlax</i> incorporates many <a href="/wiki/Fictional_setting_of_Madlax" id="w">supernatural aspects and concepts</a> associated with <a href="/wiki/Psychological_thriller" id="w">psychological thrillers</a> and surrealism, which the audience must often interpret without further explanation.<sup id="_ref-DVDTalk_rev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DVDTalk_rev" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-EF_V7_rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EF_V7_rev" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-AA_V1_rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AA_V1_rev" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-AoD_V6_rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AoD_V6_rev" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

{{main}}
<i>Madlax</i> features a large cast of distinctive characters which, according to the composer Yuki Kajiura, serve as the milestones for {{nihongo}} inner growth, one of the main topics of the show (see <a href="/wiki/#Themes" id="w">Themes of &#39;&#39;Madlax&#39;&#39;</a>).<sup id="_ref-ST5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ST5" title="">[11]</a></sup> At the beginning, Margaret is a sleepy, clumsy <a href="/wiki/Amnesia" id="w">amnesiac</a>, who lives under the care of her devoted and sometimes overprotective <a href="/wiki/Maidservant" id="w">maidservant</a> {{nihongo}}, a <a href="/wiki/Child_prodigy" id="w">child prodigy</a> who graduated from school years ahead of other students to spend all her time caring for her &#34;Miss&#34;. Elenore helps keep the absent-minded and alienated Margaret out of trouble, which Margaret seems able to find even in tranquil Nafrece.<sup id="_ref-ep6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep6" title="">[12]</a></sup> Also caring for her is {{nihongo}}, a soft-spoken but strong-minded <a href="/wiki/Corporate_executive" id="w">corporate executive</a> in her early thirties<sup id="_ref-AJ_V1_rev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AJ_V1_rev" title="">[3]</a></sup> who was once her tutor.<sup id="_ref-ep6_VanEl_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep6_VanEl" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is also Vanessa who links Margaret to the other female lead in the second half of the series &#8212; {{nihongo}}, a beautiful and kind young woman who happens to be the most efficient operative and assassin in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika.<sup id="_ref-ep1_agnt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep1_agnt" title="">[14]</a></sup> When Vanessa travels to Gazth-Sonika, she hires Madlax as her <a href="/wiki/Bodyguard" id="w">bodyguard</a>. Just like Margaret, Madlax remembers next to nothing of her life before twelve years ago, except the word that she accepted as her code name and a vague <a href="/wiki/Flashback" id="w">image</a> of her father, whom she hopes to meet one day. Madlax&#39;s supernatural battle skills prove increasingly useful when Vanessa&#39;s investigation of the Gazth-Sonikan <a href="/wiki/Casus_belli" id="w">casus belli</a>, which until then had been unjustly thought to be her own father&#39;s diplomatical incompetence,<sup id="_ref-ep13_VPar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep13_VPar" title="">[15]</a></sup> draws the attention of a powerful criminal intelligence network named &#34;Enfant&#34; ({{lang-fr}}) to them.</p>
<p>The mysterious masked head of Enfant, known as {{nihongo}}, is shown single-handedly controlling all information channels on the planet<sup id="_ref-ep4_Enfant_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep4_Enfant" title="">[16]</a></sup> and commanding an army of agents to pursue his obscure goals that involve, among others, Margaret and Madlax. One of these agents is his right-hand man {{nihongo}} who often plays his own game under Monday&#39;s nose. Carrossea attempts to gain the trust of Margaret Burton, whom he is assigned to observe, yet he also feels himself mysteriously drawn to her. Another agent of Enfant in the series is {{nihongo}}, an officer of the Gazth-Sonikan royal guard and excellent <a href="/wiki/Sniper" id="w">sniper</a> who develops a bitter rivalry with Madlax.</p>
<a id="Plot_summary" name="Plot_summary"></a><h2> Plot summary </h2>
<p>{{see also}}
The first half of the series alternates between the two leads.  Madlax works as a <a href="/wiki/Special_forces" id="w">special ops</a> agent for hire in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika, while Margaret enjoys the tranquility of Nafrece, a country apparently styled after <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>.<sup id="_ref-ep14_Eiffel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep14_Eiffel" title="">[17]</a></sup> When a &#34;picture book&#34;, presumably given to Margaret by her late father, attracts the attention of international crime syndicate Enfant, she starts researching the book&#39;s origins and discovers that they lie in Gazth-Sonika. Enfant&#39;s top operative, Carrossea Doon, tracks Margaret down but tips off his superiors in the wrong direction &#8212; towards Madlax, who has been causing Enfant trouble in Gazth-Sonika for some time. Meanwhile, Vanessa Rene, Margaret&#39;s former tutor, discovers that her employer, Bookwald Industries, covertly supports the <a href="/wiki/Civil_war" id="w">civil war</a> in Gazth-Sonika by supplying both sides with firearms and decides to find more about the true cause of the war. Her investigation brings her to Gazth-Sonika, where Madlax is assigned as her <a href="/wiki/Bodyguard" id="w">bodyguard</a>, and together, they uncover data that proves that Enfant orchestrated the entire conflict. Enfant intercepts and forces them into hiding. Back in Nafrece, Margaret decides to travel to Gazth-Sonika to help Vanessa and is accompanied by both her maidservant Elenore Baker and Carrossea Doon. </p>
<p>Eventually, Madlax and Margaret encounter each other and embark on a search for <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madlax_characters#Quanzitta Marison" id="w">Quanzitta Marison</a>, a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who is suggested to know about Margaret&#39;s book, Enfant&#39;s involvement with it, and Enfant itself. Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Friday Monday (Enfant&#39;s leader) possesses <a href="/wiki/Supernatural" id="w">supernatural</a> powers connected to the <a href="/wiki/Fictional_setting_of_Madlax#Holy Books" id="w">three ancient books</a>, one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he in fact died 12 years ago, and held on to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret. Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to complete his own goals. </p>

</p>
<p>While Margaret and Carrossea perform the ritual, Madlax is attacked by her <a href="/wiki/Arch-nemesis" id="w">arch-nemesis</a> throughout the show, Limelda Jorg. Limelda accidentally kills Vanessa while targeting Madlax, sending the latter into <a href="/wiki/Clinical_depression" id="w">clinical depression</a>. Elenore and Lady Quanzitta&#39;s servant <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madlax_characters#Nakhl" id="w">Nakhl</a> manage to restore Madlax&#39;s will to live and persuade her to save Margaret, and the three storm Enfant&#39;s headquarters together. During the assault, Elenore is killed and Margaret, now under Monday&#39;s control, shoots Madlax. Believing her to be dead, Monday commences a ritual to unleash people&#39;s inhibitions and trigger worldwide anarchy; but Margaret&#39;s memories return and she snaps out of his <a href="/wiki/Mind_control" id="w">mind control</a>. Only now does the audience learn the truth: back in 1999, Monday drove Margaret&#39;s father insane with his powers and she was forced to kill her own parent. To escape the horrible truth of her <a href="/wiki/Patricide" id="w">patricide</a>, Margaret split herself into three personae: the &#34;memory keeper&#34; <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madlax_characters#Laetitia" id="w">Laetitia</a>, the sinful Madlax, and the innocent Margaret herself. After the revelation, Madlax reappears and guns down Monday, followed by Margaret fusing the three personae to undo the ritual she previously performed with Monday, saving the world from insanity. Upon accomplishing that, she once again splits herself in three, judging that after twelve years, she no longer has the right to make decisions for her other personae.</p>
<a id="Themes" name="Themes"></a><h2> Themes </h2>
<p>Among the most prominent recurring themes in <i>Madlax</i> is <a href="/wiki/War" id="w">war</a>, its causes and the destructive effects it has upon the characters&#39; lives.<sup id="_ref-CW_lives_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CW_lives" title="">[18]</a></sup> The first episodes contrast the tranquil Nafrece with the war-torn Gazth-Sonika;<sup id="_ref-DV_V1_rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DV_V1_rev" title="">[19]</a></sup> later, the story moves completely to the combat zone, focusing on the central characters, such as Limelda Jorg,<sup id="_ref-AoD_V5_rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AoD_V5_rev" title="">[20]</a></sup> and their suffering.

<p>According to the director Kōichi Mashimo, he has always envisioned <i>Noir</i> and <i>Madlax</i> as part of a trilogy belonging to the girls-with-guns genre,<sup id="_ref-GWG_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GWG" title="">[5]</a></sup> and soon after the release of the latter, he revealed that the third installment was already being planned (later revealed to be <i>El Cazador de la Bruja</i>).<sup id="_ref-Wong_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wong" title="">[1]</a></sup> In late 2002, Mashimo invited <a href="/wiki/Shigeru_Kitayama" id="w">Shigeru Kitayama</a>, the producer of <i>Noir</i> who once came up with its original idea, to discuss a new series entitled <i>Madlax</i>. Kitayama greatly expanded Mashimo&#39;s original <a href="/wiki/Screenplay" id="w">screenplay</a> plan, but it was not until <a href="/wiki/Y%C5%8Dsuke_Kuroda" id="w">Yōsuke Kuroda</a> was put in charge of the script that the series took its final appearance. It took Kuroda around one year to finish the screenplays for all 26 episodes, during which he was constantly encouraged by Mashimo to add his own original ideas to their initial plan. Kuroda has admitted that at the time he received Mashimo&#39;s invitation, he felt frustrated after his first project has been canceled by the publisher, so he decided to make <i>Madlax</i> &#34;really extravagant&#34;, blending as many genres at once as he could. Kōichi Mashimo, furthermore, admitted that the most unusual <a href="/wiki/Plot_twist" id="w">plot twists</a>, like Margaret and Madlax&#39;s connection to each other, were invented by Kuroda and him while <a href="/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication" id="w">drunk</a>.<sup id="_ref-Wong_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wong" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>By comparison with <i>Noir</i>, <i>Madlax</i> features a much larger primary cast, including multiple recurring male <a href="/wiki/Fictional_character" id="w">characters</a>, an element nearly absent in the former. It was not so in the original screenplay draft written by Mashimo and Kitayama: for example, &#34;Madlax&#34; was Margaret&#39;s own nickname and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madlax_characters#Charlie" id="w">Charlie</a> (Vanessa&#39;s colleague at Bookwald Industries) had one of the central roles similar to Speedy&#39;s in <i><a href="/wiki/Avenger_(anime)" id="w">Avenger</a></i>. Only the &#34;draft&#34; characters&#39; names remained of them when Kuroda has rewritten the script. A total of three <a href="/wiki/Character_design" id="w">character designers</a> collaborated on <i>Madlax</i> cast: <a href="/wiki/Satoshi_Ohsawa" id="w">Satoshi Ohsawa</a> (who also worked on <i>Noir</i> cast) created the central heroines Margaret and Madlax; Minako Shiba drew the agents of Enfant led by Friday Monday and Carrossea Doon; and Satoko Miyachi was entrusted with the &#34;mysterious&#34; characters, Laetitia and Poupee.<sup id="_ref-ST12_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ST12" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ST4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ST4" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Seiy%C5%AB" id="w">Seiyūs</a> who voiced characters in <i>Madlax</i> have participated in earlier projects by studio Bee Train, for example, <a href="/wiki/Houko_Kuwashima" id="w">Houko Kuwashima</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aya_Hisakawa" id="w">Aya Hisakawa</a> who played Kirika Yuumura and Chloe in <i>Noir</i> also voiced Margaret Burton and Limelda Jorg.<sup id="_ref-ANN_Kuwashima_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN_Kuwashima" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ANN_Hisakawa_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN_Hisakawa" title="">[39]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Kotono_Mitsuishi" id="w">Kotono Mitsuishi</a> (Mireille Bouquet in <i>Noir</i>), on the other hand, has received only a minor role (Margaret&#39;s mother in episode 21),<sup id="_ref-ANN_Mitsuishi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN_Mitsuishi" title="">[40]</a></sup> while the titular lead of <i>Madlax</i> was voiced by <a href="/wiki/Sanae_Kobayashi" id="w">Sanae Kobayashi</a>, previously involved with <i><a href="/wiki/.hack//Liminality" id="w">.hack//Liminality</a></i> (Mai Minase).<sup id="_ref-ANN_Kobayashi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN_Kobayashi" title="">[41]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Masashi_Ebara" id="w">Masashi Ebara</a> (Friday Monday) also had a major role in <i>Liminality</i> (Junichiro Tokuoka).<sup id="_ref-ANN_Ebara_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN_Ebara" title="">[42]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Monica_Rial" id="w">Monica Rial</a> (Kirika Yuumura in the English translation of <i>Noir</i>) worked on the translation of the screenplay for the ADV Films release,<sup id="_ref-ANN_Rial_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN_Rial" title="">[43]</a></sup> which earned praise from the critics.<sup id="_ref-ANN_V67_rev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN_V67_rev" title="">[21]</a></sup><br/></p>

Originally, <i>Madlax</i> was broadcast in Japan by <a href="/wiki/TV_Tokyo" id="w">TV Tokyo</a> from <a href="/wiki/5_April" id="w">5 April</a> to <a href="/wiki/27_September" id="w">27 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, from 1:30 to 2:00 a.m. every Tuesday (formally, Monday night).<sup id="_ref-TVT_lineup_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TVT_lineup" title="">[44]</a></sup> Shortly before the series finished airing, it has been licensed in North America and Europe by ADV Films,<sup id="_ref-ADV_PR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ADV_PR" title="">[45]</a></sup> which has previously acquired distribution rights for <i>Noir</i> and has long had plans to license its successor, as well.<sup id="_ref-Ac_ann_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ac_ann" title="">[46]</a></sup> The official English <a href="/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)" id="w">dub</a> has been released under the trademark <i>MADLAX</i> on a total of seven DVDs from 12 April 2005 to 28 March 2006 and received a TV-14 <a href="/wiki/Television_rating_system#United States" id="w">rating</a>, though it has been lowered to TV-PG for the consequent <a href="/wiki/Cable_network" id="w">cable network</a> broadcast.<sup id="_ref-IMDb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IMDb" title="">[47]</a></sup> <i>Madlax</i> has become the first series on which ADV Films&#39; director and producer <a href="/wiki/David_Williams_(producer)" id="w">David Williams</a> tested the technology of distributing <a href="/wiki/Promotion_(marketing)" id="w">promotional</a> materials via <a href="/wiki/Peer-to-peer" id="w">P2P network</a> <a href="/wiki/BitTorrent" id="w">BitTorrent</a>.<sup id="_ref-BT-promo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BT-promo" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>

<p>Since <a href="/wiki/7_February" id="w">7 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, <i>Madlax</i> is aired on Anime Network (which is, like ADV Films, a subsidiary of <a href="/wiki/A.D._Vision" id="w">A.D. Vision</a>) on Tuesdays from 8:00 to 8:30 p.m. (each episode is repeated on 11:00 p.m. the same day and on 7:30 p.m. the next Tuesday). On 4 April, shortly after the last DVD volume has been released, the consequent broadcast was put on halt and until 27 June, only the first 8 episodes were repeated. Since then, the series has been relaunched twice: on 1 August and 7 November 2006.<sup id="_ref-AN-air_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AN-air" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>

Like with many of studio Bee Train&#39;s other works (including <i>Noir</i>, her first collaboration with them), the entire <i>Madlax</i> soundtrack was composed by the acclaimed Yuki Kajiura, making it her and Kōichi Mashimo&#39;s fifth project together. Kajiura and <a href="/wiki/Yuuka_Nanri" id="w">Yuuka Nanri</a>&#39;s duo <a href="/wiki/FictionJunction_YUUKA" id="w">FictionJunction YUUKA</a> recorded the series&#39; opening and ending themes, {{nihongo}} and &#34;inside your heart&#34;, respectively, as well as two insert songs: &#34;nowhere&#34; and &#34;I&#39;m here&#34;. Aside from the opening sequence, &#34;Fragments of an Eye&#34; is featured in the series itself: at the end of episode 18 and in the episode 24, when Margaret is humming its tune (along with another song called &#34;Cradle&#34;) to herself in the flower field.</p>
<p>The entire OST has been released on two albums in 2004. Two singles were published in the same year by FictionJunction YUUKA, each containing an opening/ending theme and one insert song, as well as their respective <a href="/wiki/Karaoke" id="w">karaoke</a> versions.<sup id="_ref-OST_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OST" title="">[52]</a></sup> In an interview Kajiura recalls having written the score in a hotel high-rise to save studio costs, and that this change in location helped her to explore different styles of music.<sup id="_ref-OST1_int_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OST1_int" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the insert song &#34;nowhere&#34;, there is a frequently repeated background <a href="/wiki/Refrain" id="w">refrain</a> {{nihongo}}, which is meaningless chanting rather than an actual word. Since the song usually plays when Madlax is fighting, &#34;Yanmaani&#34; has become something of a joke to many <i>Madlax</i> fans: its loud singing has come to symbolize Madlax&#39;s apparent invincibility - some see it as a kind of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Magic_word" id="w">magic word</a>&#34; that powers Madlax up for battle, in accordance with the <a href="/wiki/Magical_girl" id="w">magical girl</a> genre canons.<sup id="_ref-ST3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ST3" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>

Unlike <i><a href="/wiki/Noir_(anime)" id="w">Noir</a></i>, which became instantly successful in Japan and Western countries despite controversial opinions about it, <i>Madlax</i> has never been able to match it in fame and received only moderate (though generally approving) attention from the critics. <i>Madlax</i> was often accused of being secondary and reusing <i>Noir<b>s stylistic solutions, such as the story <a href="/wiki/Premise_(film)" id="w">premise</a>, the two heroines&#39; appearance, and the musical style.<sup id="_ref-ANN_V1_rev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN_V1_rev" title="">[4]</a></sup> Nevertheless, some sources praised the story for being more monolithic and consequent than its predecessor&#39;s, owing to all its episodes and <a href="/wiki/Subplot" id="w">subplots</a> being tightly intertwined and held together by the primary <a href="/wiki/A-Plot" id="w">A-Plot</a>.<sup id="_ref-AoD_V7_rev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AoD_V7_rev" title="">[50]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>The majority of reviewers perceived the early episodes of <i>Madlax</i> as boring and too slow-paced,<sup id="_ref-AJ_V1_rev_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AJ_V1_rev" title="">[3]</a></sup> but some of the same critics later remarked that the prolonged <a href="/wiki/Exposition_(literary_technique)" id="w">exposition</a> is crucial to the unusual <a href="/wiki/Finale" id="w">finale</a> of the series, which fully establishes the series&#39; own identity and sets it apart from other works.<sup id="_ref-DVDTalk_rev_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DVDTalk_rev" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ANN_V67_rev_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN_V67_rev" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-AoD_V7_rev_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AoD_V7_rev" title="">[50]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DV_V6_rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DV_V6_rev" title="">[61]</a></sup> According to them, after the initial volume, the story gets better and better with every new episode,<sup id="_ref-AoD_V4_rev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AoD_V4_rev" title="">[34]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DV_V3_rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DV_V3_rev" title="">[62]</a></sup> though some have been dissatisfied with its &#34;pseudo-<a href="/wiki/Existentialism" id="w">existentialistic</a>&#34; ending.<sup id="_ref-DV_V7_rev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DV_V7_rev" title="">[49]</a></sup> Erica Friedman, the president of <a href="/wiki/Yuricon" id="w">Yuricon</a>, highly praised Kuroda&#39;s script, naming it &#34;the best writing that Bee Train has done&#34;.<sup id="_ref-EF_V7_rev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EF_V7_rev" title="">[8]</a></sup> Professional reviewers welcomed the increased number of sympathetic characters,<sup id="_ref-AoD_V6_rev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AoD_V6_rev" title="">[10]</a></sup> especially of the distinguishable male ones (Friday, Carrossea, Colonel Burton), as opposed to <a href="/wiki/Stormtrooper_effect" id="w">stormtrooper</a>-like operatives of Soldats in <i>Noir</i>,<sup id="_ref-AJ_V1_rev_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AJ_V1_rev" title="">[3]</a></sup> but the female character designs were still said to be much more detailed (to the point of <a href="/wiki/Fanservice" id="w">fanservice</a> in case of Madlax) than more generic male ones.<sup id="_ref-ANN_V67_rev_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN_V67_rev" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p>The initial slow pacing, especially compared to the first episodes of <i>Noir</i>,<sup id="_ref-ANN_V1_rev_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN_V1_rev" title="">[4]</a></sup> became a main reason why the audience often dropped watching <i>Madlax</i> before it could present its later story turns which eventually resulted in the moderate success of the series.<sup id="_ref-ANN_V1_rev_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN_V1_rev" title="">[4]</a></sup> Among other suggested reasons behind the mediocre popularity of the show were: the <a href="/wiki/Market_saturation" id="w">market saturation</a>, which resulted from other anime series attempting to repeat the success of <i>Noir</i> since <a href="/wiki/2001_in_television" id="w">2001</a>; the expectable disinterest against a &#34;<i>Noir</i> <a href="/wiki/Remake" id="w">remake</a>&#34;, found among the fans of the first series;<sup id="_ref-AJ_V1_rev_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AJ_V1_rev" title="">[3]</a></sup> the over-the-top action scenes that some felt to be ridiculous;<sup id="_ref-THEM_rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-THEM_rev" title="">[65]</a></sup> and its unconventional genre, which straddled <i>Madlax</i> uncomfortably between fans of mystical <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a> and those who prefer <i>Noir</i>&#39;s strict realism.<sup id="_ref-AoD_V6_rev_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AoD_V6_rev" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
