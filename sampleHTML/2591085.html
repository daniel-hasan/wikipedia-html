The written <b>history of New Jersey</b> began with the exploration of the <a href="/wiki/Jersey_Shore" id="w">Jersey Coast</a> by <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_da_Verrazzano" id="w">Giovanni da Verrazzano</a> in 1524, though the region had been settled for millennia by <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native Americans</a>. At the time of European contact, the area was populated many tribes of <a href="/wiki/Lenape" id="w">Lenape</a>. The <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a> region soon came under the control of the <a href="/wiki/Swedes" id="w">Swedes</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Dutch</a> resulting in a struggle in which the Dutch were victorious. However, the Dutch colony of <a href="/wiki/New_Netherland" id="w">New Netherland</a> was seized by the <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> in 1694. New Jersey was one of the original 13 colonies that joined the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" id="w">American Revolutionary War</a> in 1776. It signed the <a href="/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation" id="w">Articles of Confederation</a> in 1779 with <a href="/wiki/Princeton%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Princeton</a> acting as the nation&#39;s capital for four months in 1783. New Jersey became independent after the American Revolutionary War, in which several crucial battles were fought in New Jersey resulting in American victories. In 1787, New Jersey was the third state to ratify the newly drafted <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution" id="w">United States Constitution</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, New Jersey cities led the nation into the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" id="w">Industrial Revolution</a> and provided soldiers for many of the wars the United States fought, including 88,000 soldiers for the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>. The state became a component of the <a href="/wiki/Underground_Railroad" id="w">Underground Railroad</a>. The state&#39;s transportation system continued to improve with the construction of canals and more rail lines that helped industrialization further develop. During the early 1900s, New Jersey prospered but weakened in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">Great Depression</a> in the 1930s. During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" id="w">Cold War</a> New Jersey&#39;s shipyards and military bases played an important role in the defense of the United States. In the 1960s New Jersey was the site of several race riots and of the <a href="/wiki/Glassboro_Summit_Conference" id="w">Glassboro Summit Conference</a>, between American President <a href="/wiki/Lyndon_Johnson" id="w">Lyndon Johnson</a> and Soviet Premier <a href="/wiki/Aleksei_Kosygin" id="w">Aleksei Kosygin</a>.</p>
<a id="Prehistory" name="Prehistory"></a><h1>Prehistory</h1>
<p>Around 180 million years ago, during the <a href="/wiki/Jurassic_Period" id="w">Jurassic Period</a>, New Jersey bordered <a href="/wiki/North_Africa" id="w">North Africa</a>. The pressure of the collision between North America and Africa gave rise to the <a href="/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains" id="w">Appalachian Mountains</a>. During this period, <a href="/wiki/Pangaea" id="w">Pangaea</a> broke apart into <a href="/wiki/Laurasia" id="w">Laurasia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gondwana" id="w">Gondwana</a>, and the North American continent became separated from the North African continent. Around 18,000 years ago, the <a href="/wiki/Ice_Age" id="w">Ice Age</a> resulted in <a href="/wiki/Glacier" id="w">glaciers</a> that reached New Jersey. As the glaciers retreated, they left behind <a href="/wiki/Glacial_Lake_Passaic" id="w">Lake Passaic</a>, as well as many rivers, swamps, and gorges.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>New Jersey was first settled by a <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native American</a> group known as the <a href="/wiki/Lenape" id="w">Lenni-Lenape</a>, but called the Delaware Indians by European settlers. The Lenape were loosely organized groups that practiced small-scale agriculture (mainly based on <a href="/wiki/Maize" id="w">corn</a>) in order to increase their largely mobile hunter-gatherer society in the region surrounding the <a href="/wiki/Delaware_River" id="w">Delaware River</a>, the lower <a href="/wiki/Hudson_River" id="w">Hudson River</a>, and western <a href="/wiki/Long_Island_Sound" id="w">Long Island Sound</a>. The Lenape society was divided into <a href="/wiki/Matrilinear" id="w">matrilinear</a> clans that were based upon common female ancestors. These clans were organized into three distinct <a href="/wiki/Phratry" id="w">phratries</a> identified by their animal sign: <a href="/wiki/Turtle" id="w">Turtle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Turkey_(bird)" id="w">Turkey</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Wolf" id="w">Wolf</a>. They first encountered the Dutch in the early 1600s, and their primary relationship with the Europeans was through <a href="/wiki/Fur_trade" id="w">fur trade</a>.</p>

In 1524, <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_da_Verrazzano" id="w">Giovanni da Verrazzano</a>, sailing in the service of <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, explored the <a href="/wiki/Jersey_Shore" id="w">Jersey Coast</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> New Jersey&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Cape_May" id="w">Cape May</a> was discovered in 1609 by <a href="/wiki/Sir_Henry_Hudson" id="w">Sir Henry Hudson</a> in the service of the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company" id="w">Dutch East India Company</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Captain <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Jacobsen_Mey" id="w">Cornelius Jacobsen Mey</a>, a Dutch explorer, also explored the New Jersey and <a href="/wiki/Delaware_Bay" id="w">Delaware Bay</a> area. Cape May was named after Mey, as were the <a href="/wiki/Cape_May%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">town</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cape_May_County" id="w">county</a> of the same name.</p>
<a id="New_Netherland" name="New_Netherland"></a><h2>New Netherland</h2>
<p>Much of New Jersey was claimed by the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Dutch</a> before the arrival of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">British</a>. The Dutch colony of <a href="/wiki/New_Netherland" id="w">New Netherland</a> consisted of parts of modern <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a> and New Jersey. Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the Lenape, Dutch policy required formal purchase of all land settled upon, and the first such purchase was of <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" id="w">Manhattan</a>, by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Minuit" id="w">Peter Minuit</a>. The first settlement on land that was to become modern New Jersey was at <a href="/wiki/Pavonia_(New_Netherlands)" id="w">Pavonia</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Jersey_City" id="w">Jersey City</a>) in 1629.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The last Dutch governor was <a href="/wiki/Peter_Stuyvesant" id="w">Peter Stuyvesant</a>, who was unpopular with his subjects because he tried to restrict religious freedom: the <a href="/wiki/Flushing_Remonstrance_of_1657" id="w">Flushing Remonstrance of 1657</a> objected to his ban on <a href="/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends" id="w">Quakers</a> as an infringement on the residents as <a href="/wiki/Christians" id="w">Christians</a> and as Dutch citizens. Stuyvesant used military coercion in order to accomplish some of his goals, which only made him more disliked. At New Netherland&#39;s height, 6,000 inhabitants resided in the colony.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="New_Sweden" name="New_Sweden"></a><h2>New Sweden</h2>
<p>{{main}}
In addition, part of southwestern New Jersey was settled by the <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Swedes</a> by the mid-17th century.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/New_Sweden" id="w">New Sweden</a>, founded in 1638, rose to its height under governor <a href="/wiki/Johan_Bj%C3%B6rnsson_Printz" id="w">Johan Björnsson Printz</a> (1643–1653). Led by Printz, the settlement extended as far north as <a href="/wiki/Fort_Christina" id="w">Fort Christina</a>, on both sides of the <a href="/wiki/Delaware_River" id="w">Delaware River</a>. He helped to improve the military and commercial status of the colony by constructing <a href="/wiki/Fort_Nya_Elfsborg" id="w">Fort Nya Elfsborg</a>, near present-day <a href="/wiki/Salem%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Salem</a> on the east side of the Delaware River. This action prevented the river from being easily taken by the English and Dutch, who were also trying to expand into the New World. The Swedish and Finnish colonists generally lived in peace with their Dutch and Lenape neighbors. Under the last governor of New Sweden, <a href="/wiki/Johan_Rising" id="w">Johan Rising</a>, the Swedes captured Fort Casimir (now <a href="/wiki/New_Castle%2C_Delaware" id="w">New Castle, Delaware</a>), which was close to Fort Christina and later named Fort Trinity by the Swedes. </p>
<p>This action provoked a furious Governor Stuyvesant, who, in revenge, sent seven armed Dutch ships and 317 soldiers to the Delaware River the next summer. Realizing it was hopeless, the outnumbered Swedes surrendered Fort Trinity, and surrendered Fort Christina two weeks later. In 1655, the Dutch completely took over these lands and annexed them to New Netherland.</p>

From the colony of New Netherland, the Dutch interfered with Britain&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Transatlantic" id="w">transatlantic</a> trade with its North American colonies. Insisting that <a href="/wiki/John_Cabot" id="w">John Cabot</a> had been the first to discover North America, the British granted the land that now encompasses New Jersey to the <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_York" id="w">Duke of York</a>, who ordered <a href="/wiki/Colonel" id="w">Colonel</a> <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nicolls" id="w">Richard Nicolls</a> to take over the area. In September 1664, a British fleet under Nicolls&#39; command sailed into what is now <a href="/wiki/New_York_Harbor" id="w">New York Harbor</a> and seized the colony. The British encountered little resistance, perhaps due to the unpopularity of the Dutch governor, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Stuyvesant" id="w">Peter Stuyvesant</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> After capturing the colony, Nicolls became deputy-governor of <a href="/wiki/New_Amsterdam" id="w">New Amsterdam</a> and the rest of New Netherland, and guaranteed colonists&#39; property rights, laws of inheritance, and the enjoyment of <a href="/wiki/Religious_freedom" id="w">religious freedom</a>. New Netherland was renamed New Jersey (after the <a href="/wiki/English_Channel" id="w">English Channel</a> Island of <a href="/wiki/Jersey" id="w">Jersey</a> on which <a href="/wiki/Charles_II_of_England" id="w">Charles II of England</a> was proclaimed king in 1649) and <a href="/wiki/New_Amsterdam" id="w">New Amsterdam</a> was renamed <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York</a> (after the Duke of York).</p>

<p>Charles II gave the region between <a href="/wiki/New_England" id="w">New England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maryland" id="w">Maryland</a> to his brother, the Duke of York (later <a href="/wiki/James_II_of_England" id="w">King James II</a>), as a <a href="/wiki/Proprietary_colony" id="w">proprietary colony</a>. Later James granted the land between the <a href="/wiki/Hudson_River" id="w">Hudson River</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Delaware_River" id="w">Delaware River</a> that would become New Jersey to two friends who had been loyal to him through the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" id="w">English Civil War</a>: Sir <a href="/wiki/George_Carteret" id="w">George Carteret</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Berkeley" id="w">Lord Berkeley of Stratton</a>. The two proprietors of New Jersey tried to entice more settlers to New Jersey by granting land to settlers and by passing <a href="/wiki/Concession_and_Agreement" id="w">Concession and Agreement</a>, a document granting religious freedom to all inhabitants of New Jersey; the British <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" id="w">Church of England</a> allowed no such religious freedom. In return for land, settlers paid annual fees known as quitrents. The proprietors appointed <a href="/wiki/Philip_Carteret_(Governor)" id="w">Philip Carteret</a> as the first governor of New Jersey, who designated <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Elizabethtown</a> as the colony&#39;s capital.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> However, the two proprietors found collecting the quitrents difficult, and on <a href="/wiki/March_18" id="w">March 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1673" id="w">1673</a> Berkeley sold his share of New Jersey to the <a href="/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends" id="w">Quakers</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>This sale divided the province into <a href="/wiki/East_Jersey" id="w">East Jersey</a> and <a href="/wiki/West_Jersey" id="w">West Jersey</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Border_between_West_Jersey_and_East_Jersey" id="w">exact border between West and East Jersey</a> generally corresponded to the <a href="/wiki/Keith_line" id="w">border</a> between present day <a href="/wiki/South_Jersey" id="w">South</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_Jersey" id="w">North Jersey</a> and was created by <a href="/wiki/George_Keith" id="w">George Keith</a>. However, the line was constantly the subject of disputes. With the 1676 <a href="/wiki/Quintipartite_Deed" id="w">Quintipartite Deed</a> more accurate surveys and maps were made resulting in the Thornton line, drawn around 1696, and the Lawrence line, drawn around 1743, which was adopted as the final line for legal purposes.</p>
<p>Many of the colonists of New Jersey became farmers. However, despite the fertility of the soil, farmers were forced to struggle due to the dearth of <a href="/wiki/British_coinage" id="w">English money</a>. Some owned <a href="/wiki/Slavery" id="w">slaves</a> or had <a href="/wiki/Indentured_servant" id="w">indentured servants</a> work for them. The majority of the colonists lived in simple log cabins, coming from the original Dutch settlers. Since New Jersey was ideally located next to the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a>, colonists farmed, fished, and traded by sea. Transportation was slow and difficult usually on either foot or horseback. Education came through small religious schools, private academies, or tutors. </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_15" id="w">April 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1702" id="w">1702</a>, under the reign of <a href="/wiki/Anne_of_Great_Britain" id="w">Queen Anne</a>, West and East Jersey were reunited as a <a href="/wiki/Royal_colony" id="w">royal colony</a>. <a href="/wiki/Edward_Hyde" id="w">Edward Hyde</a>, Lord Cornbury became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony. Lord Cornbury was an ineffective and corrupt ruler, taking bribes and speculating on land, so in 1708 he was recalled to England. New Jersey was then ruled by the governors of <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>, but this infuriated the settlers of New Jersey, who accused those governors of favoritism to New York. <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Morris_(1671-1746)" id="w">Judge Lewis Morris</a> led the case for a separate governor, and was appointed governor by <a href="/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain" id="w">King George II</a> in 1738.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> From 1701 to 1765, New Jersey&#39;s border with New York was in dispute, resulting in a <a href="/wiki/New_York-New_Jersey_Line_War" id="w">series of skirmishes and raids</a>.</p>
<p>In 1746 <i>The College of New Jersey</i> (now <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton University</a>) was founded in Elizabethtown by a group of <a href="/wiki/First_Great_Awakening" id="w">Great Awakening</a> &#34;New Lighters&#34; that included <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Dickinson_(of_New_Jersey)" id="w">Jonathan Dickinson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aaron_Burr%2C_Sr." id="w">Aaron Burr, Sr.</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peter_Van_Brugh_Livingston" id="w">Peter Van Brugh Livingston</a>.

The second version of the <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey_State_Constitution" id="w">New Jersey State Constitution</a> was written in 1844. The constitution provided suffrage only to white males, removing it from all women and from people of other races. Suffrage had been awarded to those groups under the original New Jersey State Constitution of 1776. Some important components of the second State Constitution include the separation of the powers of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

<p>The agricultural products from New Jersey usually were transported to larger markets in New York City and Philadelphia, requiring better transportation. The first oceangoing <a href="/wiki/Steamboat" id="w">steamboat</a> went from <a href="/wiki/Hoboken%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Hoboken, New Jersey</a>, sailed around southern New Jersey, and ended in Philadelphia.

The <a href="/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends" id="w">Quaker</a> population was especially intolerant of slavery, and the state was a major part of the <a href="/wiki/Underground_Railroad" id="w">Underground Railroad</a>. Though New Jersey passed an act for the gradual abolition of slavery in 1804, it was not until 1830 that most blacks were free in the state. New Jersey was the last northern state to abolish slavery completely, and by the close of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">Civil War</a>, about a dozen African-Americans in New Jersey were still apprenticed freedmen. New Jersey at first refused to ratify the <a href="/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">Constitutional Amendment banning slavery</a>.</p>
<p>Although no Civil War battles were fought within New Jersey, the state sent over 88,000 soldiers as part of some 31 infantry and cavalry regiments, and over 6,000 died in the war. 23,116 of those soldiers served in the <a href="/wiki/Army_of_the_Potomac" id="w">Army of the Potomac</a>.

<p>New Jersey was a center of shipbuilding and manufacturing during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>. Existing factories such as the <a href="/wiki/Singer_Company" id="w">Singer Company</a> in <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Elizabeth, New Jersey</a> were converted to making weapon parts.

In 1947, the current <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey_State_Constitution" id="w">New Jersey State Constitution</a> was ratified, reorganizing the state government. Governors were allowed to serve four years instead of three, and <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey_Legislature" id="w">the Legislature</a> was constituted with a 40-member <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey_Senate" id="w">Senate</a> and an 80-member <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey_General_Assembly" id="w">General Assembly</a>. The new State Constitution also returned the right of suffrage to females and non-whites.</p>

<p>During the 1960s, many African Americans felt disenfranchised, feelings exacerbated by the police that usually sided against African Americans and by the poor urban conditions caused by urban decay. This tension led to race riots, the first of which occurred in <a href="/wiki/Jersey_City%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Jersey City</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_2" id="w">August 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1964" id="w">1964</a>, causing heavy damage to the Jersey City area. 71 stores were damaged and 46 people were injured.
