<b>Mauthausen</b> (known from the summer of 1940 as <b>Mauthausen-Gusen</b>) grew to become a large group of <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Nazi</a> <a href="/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps" id="w">concentration camps</a> that were built around the <a href="/wiki/Village" id="w">villages</a> of <a href="/wiki/Mauthausen" id="w">Mauthausen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gusen" id="w">Gusen</a> in <a href="/wiki/Upper_Austria" id="w">Upper Austria</a>, roughly 20 km east of the city of <a href="/wiki/Linz" id="w">Linz</a>.</p>
<p>Initially a single camp at Mauthausen, it expanded over time to become one of the largest <a href="/wiki/Labour_camp" id="w">labour camp</a> complexes in German-controlled Europe.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz_W_obronie_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz_W_obronie" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Bischof_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bischof" title="">[2]</a></sup> Apart from the four main sub-camps at Mauthausen and nearby <a href="/wiki/Gusen" id="w">Gusen</a>, more than 50 sub-camps, located throughout Austria and southern Germany, used the inmates as <a href="/wiki/Slave_labour" id="w">slave labour</a>. Several <a href="/wiki/List_of_subcamps_of_Mauthausen" id="w">subordinate camps of the KZ Mauthausen</a> complex included quarries, <a href="/wiki/Munition" id="w">munitions</a> factories, mines, arms factories and <a href="/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_262" id="w">Me 262</a> fighter-plane assembly plants.</p>
<p>In January 1945, the camps, directed from the central office in Mauthausen, contained roughly 85,000 inmates.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz" title="">[3]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/#Death toll" id="w">death toll</a> remains unknown, although most sources place it between 122,766 and 320,000 for the entire complex. The camps formed one of the first massive concentration camp complexes in <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Nazi Germany</a>, and were the last ones to be occupied by <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" id="w">the Western Allies or the Soviet Union</a>. The two main camps, Mauthausen and Gusen I, were also the only two camps in the whole of Europe to be labelled as &#34;Grade III&#34; camps, which meant that they were intended to be the toughest camps for the &#34;Incorrigible Political Enemies of the <a href="/wiki/Reich" id="w">Reich</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz_W_obronie_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz_W_obronie" title="">[1]</a></sup> Unlike many other concentration camps, intended for all categories of prisoners, Mauthausen was mostly used for <a href="/wiki/Extermination_through_labour" id="w">extermination through labour</a> of the <i><a href="/wiki/Intelligentsia" id="w">intelligentsia</a>,</i> who were educated people and members of the higher <a href="/wiki/Social_class" id="w">social classes</a> in countries subjugated by <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>.<sup id="_ref-Gębik_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gębik" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_7" id="w">August 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1938" id="w">1938</a>, prisoners from <a href="/wiki/Dachau_concentration_camp" id="w">Dachau concentration camp</a> were sent to the town of Mauthausen near <a href="/wiki/Linz" id="w">Linz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austria</a>, to begin the construction of a new camp. The location was chosen due to its proximity to the transport hub of Linz, but also because the area was sparsely populated.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz" title="">[3]</a></sup> Although the camp was, from the beginning of its existence, controlled by the German state, it was founded by a private company as an economic enterprise. The owner of the Wiener-Graben quarry (the Marbacher-Bruch, and Bettelberg quarries), which was located in and around Mauthausen, was a <a href="/wiki/DEST" id="w">DEST</a> Company: an acronym for <i>Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke GmbH</i>. The company, led by <a href="/wiki/Oswald_Pohl" id="w">Oswald Pohl</a>, who was also a high-ranking official of the <a href="/wiki/Schutzstaffel" id="w">SS</a>, bought the quarries from the city of <a href="/wiki/Vienna" id="w">Vienna</a> and started the construction of the Mauthausen camp. A year later, the company ordered the construction of the first camp at Gusen. The <a href="/wiki/Granite" id="w">granite</a> mined in the quarries had previously been used to pave the streets of Vienna, but the Nazi authorities envisioned a complete reconstruction of major German towns in accordance with the plans of <a href="/wiki/Albert_Speer" id="w">Albert Speer</a> and other architects of <a href="/wiki/Nazi_architecture" id="w">Nazi architecture</a>,<sup id="_ref-Speer"_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Speer"" title="">[5]</a></sup> for which large quantities of granite were needed.</p>
<p>The money needed for the construction of the Mauthausen camp was gathered from a variety of sources, including commercial loans from <a href="/wiki/Dresdner_Bank" id="w">Dresdner Bank</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prague" id="w">Prague</a>-based <a href="/wiki/Escompte_Bank" id="w">Escompte Bank</a>, the so-called <a href="/wiki/Reinhardt%26%2339%3Bs_fund" id="w">Reinhardt&#39;s fund</a> (meaning money stolen from the inmates of the concentration camps themselves); and from the <a href="/wiki/German_Red_Cross" id="w">German Red Cross</a>.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Red Cross_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Red Cross" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

In late 1939, the Mauthausen camp, with its Wiener-Graben <a href="/wiki/Granite" id="w">granite</a> quarry, was already overcrowded with prisoners. Their numbers rose from 1,080 in late 1938 to over 3,000 a year later. About that time the construction of a new camp began in <a href="/wiki/Gusen" id="w">Gusen</a>, about 4.5 kilometres away. The new camp (later named <b>Gusen I</b>) and its Kastenhofen quarry were completed in May of 1940. The first inmates were put in the first two huts (No. 7 and 8) on <a href="/wiki/April_17" id="w">April 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1940" id="w">1940</a>, while the first transport of prisoners - mostly from the camps in <a href="/wiki/Dachau_concentration_camp" id="w">Dachau</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sachsenhausen_concentration_camp" id="w">Sachsenhausen</a> - arrived on <a href="/wiki/May_25" id="w">May 25</a> of the same year.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Like nearby Mauthausen, the Gusen camp also used its inmates as slave labour in the granite quarries, but they also rented them out to various local businesses. In October of 1941, several huts were separated from the Gusen sub-camp by <a href="/wiki/Barbed_wire" id="w">barbed wire</a> and turned into a separate <i>Prisoner of War Labour Camp</i> ({{lang-de}}). This camp had a large number of <a href="/wiki/Prisoners_of_war" id="w">prisoners of war</a> incarcerated, mostly Soviet officers. By 1942, the production capacity of both Mauthausen and Gusen had reached its peak. Gusen was expanded to include the central depot of the <a href="/wiki/SS" id="w">SS</a>, where various goods, which had been seized from occupied territories, were sorted and then dispatched to Germany.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz2" title="">[10]</a></sup> Local quarries and businesses were in constant need of a new source of labour as more and more Germans were drafted into the <a href="/wiki/Wehrmacht" id="w">Wehrmacht</a>.</p>
<p>In March of 1944, the former SS depot was converted to a new sub-camp, and was named <b>Gusen II</b>. Until the end of the war the depot served as an improvised concentration camp. The camp contained about 12,000 to 17,000 inmates, who were deprived of even the most basic facilities.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz_W_obronie_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz_W_obronie" title="">[1]</a></sup> In December of 1944, another part of Gusen was opened in nearby <a href="/wiki/Lungitz" id="w">Lungitz</a>. Here, parts of a factory infrastructure were converted into the third sub-camp of Gusen — <b>Gusen III</b>.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz_W_obronie_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz_W_obronie" title="">[1]</a></sup> The rise in the number of sub-camps could not catch up with the rising number of inmates, which led to overcrowding of the huts in all of the sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen. From late 1940 to 1944, the number of inmates per bed rose from 2 to 4.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz_W_obronie_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz_W_obronie" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

As the production in all of the sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen complex was constantly rising, so was the number of detainees and the number of the sub-camps themselves. Although initially the camps of Gusen and Mauthausen mostly served the local quarries, from 1942, and onwards, they began to be included in the German war machine. To accommodate the ever-increasing number of slave workers, additional sub-camps ({{lang-de}}) of Mauthausen began construction in all parts of Austria. At the end of the war the list included 101 camps (including 49 major sub-camps<sup id="_ref-Waller_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Waller" title="">[11]</a></sup>) which covered most of modern <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austria</a>, from <a href="/wiki/Mittersill" id="w">Mittersill</a> south of <a href="/wiki/Salzburg" id="w">Salzburg</a> to <a href="/wiki/Schwechat" id="w">Schwechat</a> east of <a href="/wiki/Vienna" id="w">Vienna</a> and from <a href="/wiki/Passau" id="w">Passau</a> on the pre-war Austro-German border to the <a href="/wiki/Loibl_Pass" id="w">Loibl Pass</a> on the border with <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia" id="w">Yugoslavia</a>. The sub-camps were divided into several categories, depending on their main function: <i>Produktionslager</i> for factory workers, <i>Baulager</i> for construction, <i>Aufräumlager</i> for cleaning the rubble in Allied-bombed towns, and <i>Kleinlager</i> (small camps) where the inmates were working specifically for the SS.</p>

<p>Prisoners were also &#39;rented out&#39; as slave labour, and were exploited in various ways, such as working for local farms, for road construction, reinforcing and repairing the banks of the Danube, and the construction of large residential areas in Sankt Georgen as well as being forced to excavate archaeological sites in Spielberg.</p>
<p>When the Allied <a href="/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II" id="w">strategic bombing campaign</a> started to target the German war industry, German planners decided to move production to underground facilities that were impenetrable to enemy aerial bombardment. In Gusen I, the prisoners were ordered to build several large tunnels beneath the hills surrounding the camp (code-named <i>Kellerbau</i>). By the end of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> the prisoners had dug 29,400 m² to house a small arms factory. With January 1944, similar tunnels were also built beneath the village of Sankt Georgen by the inmates of Gusen II sub-camp (code-named <i>Bergkristall</i>). They dug roughly 50,000 m² so the Messerschmitt company could build an assembly plant to produce the <a href="/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_262" id="w">Messerschmitt Me 262</a> and <a href="/wiki/V-2_rocket" id="w">V-2 rockets</a>.

When the inmates were totally exhausted, after having worked in the quarries for 12 hours a day; or if they were too ill, or too weak to work, they were then transferred to the <a href="/wiki/Revier" id="w">Revier</a> (&#34;Krankenrevier&#34;, sick barrack) or other places for extermination. Initially, the camp did not have a <a href="/wiki/Gas_chamber" id="w">gas chamber</a> of its own and the so-called <a href="/wiki/Muselmann" id="w">Muselmänner</a>, or prisoners who were too sick to work, after being maltreated, under-nourished or totally exhausted, were then transferred to other concentration camps for extermination (mostly to the infamous <a href="/wiki/Hartheim_Castle" id="w">Hartheim Castle</a>,<sup id="_ref-Traveler's Guide_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traveler's Guide" title="">[20]</a></sup> which was 40.7 km (25.3 miles) away), or killed by lethal injection and cremated in the local <a href="/wiki/Crematorium" id="w">crematorium</a>. The growing number of prisoners made the system too expensive and from 1940, Mauthausen was one of the few camps in the West to use a gas chamber on a regular basis.

Most of them were former Republican soldiers or activists who had fled to France after <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Franco" id="w">Franco</a>&#39;s victory and then were captured by German forces after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_France" id="w">French defeat</a> in 1940 or handed over to the Germans by the <a href="/wiki/Vichy_France" id="w">Vichy</a> authorities. The largest of these groups arrived at Gusen in January of 1941.<sup id="_ref-Wnuk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wnuk" title="">[24]</a></sup> In early 1941, almost all the Poles and Spaniards, except for a small group of specialists working in the quarry&#39;s stone mill, were transferred from Mauthausen to Gusen.<sup id="_ref-Grzesiuk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grzesiuk" title="">[25]</a></sup> Following the outbreak of the <a href="/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa" id="w">Soviet-German War</a> in 1941 the camps started to receive a large number of <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet</a> <a href="/wiki/Prisoners_of_war" id="w">POWs</a>. Most of them were kept in huts separated from the rest of the camp. The Soviet prisoners of war were a major part of the first groups to be gassed in the newly-built gas chamber in early 1942. In 1944, a large group of <a href="/wiki/Hungary" id="w">Hungarian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Dutch</a> Jews was also transferred to the camp.<sup id="_ref-Hungarian Jews_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hungarian Jews" title="">[26]</a></sup> Much like all the other large groups of prisoners that were transferred to Mauthausen-Gusen, most of them either died as a result of the hard labour and poor conditions, or were thrown down the sides of the Mauthausen quarry (nick-named the <i>Parachutists&#39; Wall</i> by the <a href="/wiki/Schutzstaffel" id="w">SS</a> guards and <a href="/wiki/Kapo_(concentration_camp)" id="w">Kapos</a>). This name was a sick joke because it made fun of the prisoners by calling them &#34;Parachutists without a parachute&#34;.</p>
<p>Throughout the years of World War II, the camps of Mauthausen-Gusen received new prisoners in smaller transports on a daily basis; mostly from other concentration camps in German-occupied Europe. Most of the prisoners in the sub-camps of Mauthausen were kept in various detention sites prior to transportation to their final destination. The most notable of such centres for Mauthausen-Gusen were the infamous camps at <a href="/wiki/Dachau_concentration_camp" id="w">Dachau</a> and <a href="/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp" id="w">Auschwitz</a>. The first transports from Auschwitz arrived in February of 1942. The second transport in June of that year was much larger and numbered some 1,200 prisoners. Similar groups were sent from Auschwitz to Gusen and Mauthausen in April and November of 1943, and then in January and February of 1944. Finally, after <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann" id="w">Adolf Eichmann</a> visited Mauthausen in May of that year, KZ Mauthausen-Gusen received the first group of roughly 8,000 Hungarian Jews from Auschwitz; the first group to be evacuated from that camp before the Soviet advance. Initially, the groups evacuated from Auschwitz consisted of qualified workers for the ever-growing industry of the Mauthausen-Gusen camp complex, but as the evacuation proceeded other categories of people were also transported to Mauthausen, Gusen, Vienna or <a href="/wiki/Melk" id="w">Melk</a>.

<p>Over time, Auschwitz had to almost stop accepting new prisoners and most were directed to Mauthausen instead. The last group&#8212; roughly 10,000 prisoners&#8212;was evacuated in the last wave in January of 1945, only a few weeks before the Soviet capture of the area of the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex.<sup id="_ref-KARTA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KARTA" title="">[27]</a></sup> Among them was a large group of civilians arrested by the Germans after the failure of the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising" id="w">Warsaw Uprising</a>,<sup id="_ref-Kirchmayer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kirchmayer" title="">[28]</a></sup> but by the liberation not more than 500 of them were still alive.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz-evacuation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz-evacuation" title="">[29]</a></sup> Altogether, during the final months of the war, 23,364 prisoners from other <a href="/wiki/Concentration_camp" id="w">concentration camps</a> arrived at the camp complex.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz-evacuation_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz-evacuation" title="">[29]</a></sup> Many more perished during <a href="/wiki/Death_march" id="w">death marches</a>, where they dropped dead because of pure exhaustion, or in railway wagons, where the prisoners were confined at sub-zero temperatures&#8212;without adequate food or water&#8212;for several days prior to their arrival. Prisoner transports were considered to be less important than other important services.</p>
<p>Many of those who survived the journey died before they could be registered, whilst others were given the camp numbers of prisoners who had already been killed.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz-evacuation_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz-evacuation" title="">[29]</a></sup> Most were then accommodated in the camps or in the newly-established tent camp ({{lang-de}}) just outside the Mauthausen sub-camp, where roughly 2,000 people were forced into tents intended for not more than 800 inmates, and then starved to death.<sup id="_ref-Freund_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Freund" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>As in all other <a href="/wiki/German_concentration_camps" id="w">German concentration camps</a>, not all the prisoners were equal. Their treatment depended largely on the <a href="/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camp_badges" id="w">category assigned to each inmate</a>, as well as their nationality and rank within the system. The so-called <a href="/wiki/Kapo_(Arbeitslager)" id="w">kapos</a>, or prisoners who had been recruited by their captors to police their fellow prisoners, were given more food and higher pay in the form of concentration camp coupons which could be exchanged for cigarettes in the canteen, as well as a separate room inside most barracks. In addition, following <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler" id="w">Himmler</a>&#39;s order in June, 1941, a <a href="/wiki/Brothel" id="w">brothel</a> was opened for them in 1942, in the Mauthausen and Gusen I camps.<sup id="_ref-nizkor_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nizkor" title="">[31]</a></sup> The Kapos formed the main part of the so-called <i>Prominents</i> ({{lang-de}}), or prisoners who were given a much better treatment than the average inmate.

<p>Although the Mauthausen-Gusen camp complex was mostly a labour camp for men, a women&#39;s camp was opened in Mauthausen, in September of 1944, with the first transport of female prisoners from <a href="/wiki/Auschwitz" id="w">Auschwitz</a>.

The available Mauthausen inmate statistics<sup id="_ref-Friedlander_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Friedlander" title="">[33]</a></sup> from the spring of 1943, shows that there were 2,400 prisoners below the age of 20, which was 12.8% of the 18,655 population. By late March of 1945, the number of juvenile prisoners in Mauthausen increased to 15,048, which was 19.1% of the 78,547 Mauthausen inmates. The number of imprisoned children increased 6.2 times, whereas the total number of adult prisoners during the same period multiplied by a factor of only four.

<p>Although not the only concentration camp where the German authorities implemented their <a href="/wiki/Extermination_through_labour" id="w">extermination through labour</a> (<i>Vernichtung durch Arbeit</i>), Mauthausen-Gusen was one of the most brutal and severe. The conditions within the camp were considered exceptionally hard to bear, even by concentration camp standards.<sup id="_ref-HolocaustMuseum_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HolocaustMuseum" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Bloxham_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bloxham" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Burleigh_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Burleigh" title="">[37]</a></sup> The inmates suffered not only from <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" id="w">malnutrition</a>, overcrowded huts and constant abuse and beatings by the guards and <a href="/wiki/Kapo_(Arbeitslager)" id="w">kapos</a>,<sup id="_ref-Grzesiuk_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grzesiuk" title="">[25]</a></sup> but also from exceptionally hard labour.<sup id="_ref-Abzug_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Abzug" title="">[21]</a></sup> As there were too many prisoners in Mauthausen to have all of them work in its quarry at the same time, many were put to work in workshops, or had to do other manual work, whilst the unfortunate ones who were selected to work in the quarry were only there because of their so-called &#34;crimes&#34; in the camp. The reasons for sending them to work in the &#34;Punishment-Detail&#34; were trivial, and included such &#34;crimes&#34; as not saluting a German passing by.</p>
<p>The work in the quarries — often in unbearable heat or in temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees <a href="/wiki/Celsius" id="w">Celsius</a><sup id="_ref-Grzesiuk_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grzesiuk" title="">[25]</a></sup> — led to exceptionally high mortality rates.<sup id="_ref-Mortality_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mortality" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Burleigh_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Burleigh" title="">[37]</a></sup> The food rations were limited, and during the 1940&#8211;1942 period, an average inmate weighed 40 kilograms,<sup id="_ref-Pike_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pike" title="">[39]</a></sup> roughly 88 pounds. It is estimated that the average energy content of food rations dropped from about 1,750 calories a day during the 1940&#8211;1942 period, to between 1,150 and 1,460 during the next period. In 1945, the energy content was even lower and did not exceed 600 to 1,000 calories a day; that is less than a third of the energy needed by an average worker in <a href="/wiki/Heavy_industry" id="w">heavy industry</a>.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz_W_obronie_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz_W_obronie" title="">[1]</a></sup> This led to the starvation of thousands of inmates.</p>
<p>The inmates of Mauthausen, Gusen I, and Gusen II had access to a separate sub-camp for the sick — the so-called <i>Krankenlager</i>. Despite the fact that (roughly) 100 medics from among the inmates were working there,<sup id="_ref-Krukowski_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Krukowski" title="">[40]</a></sup> they were not given any medication and could offer only basic first aid.<sup id="_ref-Krukowski_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Krukowski" title="">[40]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz" title="">[3]</a></sup> Thus the <i>hospital camp</i> &#8211; as it was called by the German authorities &#8211; was, in fact, the last stop before death for thousands of inmates, and very few had a chance to recover.

<p>The rock-quarry in Mauthausen was at the base of the infamous &#34;Stairs of Death&#34;. Prisoners were forced to carry roughly-hewn blocks of stone — often weighing as much as 50 kilograms — up the 186 stairs - one behind the other. As a result, many exhausted prisoners collapsed in front of the other prisoners in the line, and then fell on top of the other prisoners, creating a horrific <a href="/wiki/Domino" id="w">domino</a> effect; the first prisoner falling onto the next, and so on, all the way down the stairs.<sup id="_ref-Weissman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weissman" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Such brutality was not accidental. The SS guards would often force prisoners — exhausted from hours of hard labour without sufficient food and water — to race up the stairs carrying blocks of stone. Those who survived the ordeal would often be placed in a line-up at the edge of a cliff known as &#34;The Parachute Wall&#34; ({{lang-de}}).<sup id="_ref-Mauthausen-memorial_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mauthausen-memorial" title="">[42]</a></sup> At gun-point each prisoner would have the option of being shot, or to push the prisoner in front of them off of the cliff.<sup id="_ref-Waller_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Waller" title="">[11]</a></sup> Other common methods of extermination of prisoners, who were either sick, unfit for further labour or as a means of <a href="/wiki/Collective_responsibility_(doctrine)" id="w">collective responsibility</a> or after escape attempts included:</p>

<p>After the war one of the survivors, Dr. <a href="/wiki/Antoni_Go%C5%9Bci%C5%84ski" id="w">Antoni Gościński</a> reported 62 ways of murdering people in the camps of Gusen I and Mauthausen.<sup id="_ref-Oskarżamy_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oskarżamy" title="">[43]</a></sup> Hans Maršálek estimated that an average <a href="/wiki/Life_expectancy" id="w">life expectancy</a> of newly-arrived prisoners in Gusen varied from 6 months between 1940 and 1942, to less than 3 months in early 1945.<sup id="_ref-Marsalek2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marsalek2" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>Paradoxically, with the growth of forced labour industry in various sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen, the situation of some of the prisoners improved significantly. While the food rations were increasingly limited every month, the heavy industry necessitated skilled specialists rather than unqualified workers and the brutality of the camp&#39;s SS and Kapos was limited. While the prisoners were still beaten on the daily basis and the Muselmänner were still exterminated, from early 1943 on some of the factory workers were allowed to receive food parcels from their families (mostly Poles and Frenchmen). This allowed many of them not only to evade the risk of starvation, but also to help other prisoners who had no relatives outside the camps — or were not allowed to receive parcels.<sup id="_ref-Grzesiuk_food_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grzesiuk_food" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>

During the first days after the liberation, the camp&#39;s main chancellery was seized by the members of a Polish inmate resistance organization; secured against the wishes of other inmates, who wanted to burn it.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz-Samoobrona_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz-Samoobrona" title="">[54]</a></sup> After the war, the main chancellery was brought by one of the survivors to Poland, then passed to the <a href="/wiki/Auschwitz-Birkenau_Museum" id="w">Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum</a> in <a href="/wiki/O%C5%9Bwi%C4%99cim" id="w">Oświęcim</a>.<sup id="_ref-PAP_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PAP" title="">[55]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Muzeum_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Muzeum" title="">[56]</a></sup> Parts of the death register of Gusen I camp were secured by the Polish inmates, who took it to <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> after the war.

<p>The surviving camp archives include personal files of 37,411 murdered prisoners, including 22,092 Poles, 5,024 Spaniards, 2,843 Soviet prisoners of war and 7,452 inmates of 24 other nationalities.<sup id="_ref-Wlazłowski_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wlazłowski" title="">[57]</a></sup> The surviving parts of the death register of KZ Gusen list an additional 30,536 names.</p>
<p>Apart from the surviving camp files of the sub-camps of Mauthausen, the main documents used for an estimation of the death toll of the camp complexes are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A report by <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_%C5%BBmij" id="w">Józef Żmij</a>, a survivor who had been working in the Gusen I camp&#39;s chancellery. His report is based on personally-made copies of yearly reports from the period between 1940 and 1944, and the camps commander&#39;s daily reports for the period between <a href="/wiki/January_1" id="w">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>, and the day of the liberation. </li>
<li>Original death register for the sub-camp of Gusen held by the <a href="/wiki/International_Red_Cross" id="w">International Red Cross</a></li>
<li>Personal notes of <a href="/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Nogaj" id="w">Stanisław Nogaj</a>, another inmate who had been working in the chancellery of Gusen</li>
<li>Death register prepared by the SS chief medic of the Mauthausen main chancellery for the sub-camps of Gusen (similar records for the Mauthausen sub-camp itself were destroyed)</li></ol>
<p>Because of that the exact death toll of the entire Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp system varies considerably from source to source. Various scholars place it at between 122,766<sup id="_ref-tablet_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tablet" title="">[58]</a></sup> and 320,000,<sup id="_ref-Oskarżamy_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oskarżamy" title="">[43]</a></sup> with other numbers also frequently quoted being 200,000<sup id="_ref-Pike2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pike2" title="">[59]</a></sup> and &#34;over 150,000&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Wrogom_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wrogom" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>Various historians place the total death toll in the four main camps of Mauthausen, Gusen I, Gusen II and Gusen III at between 55,000<sup id="_ref-Abzug_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Abzug" title="">[21]</a></sup> and 60,000.<sup id="_ref-Gilbert_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilbert" title="">[61]</a></sup> In addition, during the first month after the liberation additional 1042 prisoners died in American field hospitals.<sup id="_ref-Wlazłowski-numbers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wlazłowski-numbers" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>Out of approximately 320,000 prisoners who were incarcerated in various sub-camps of KZ Mauthausen-Gusen throughout the war, only approximately 80,000 survived,<sup id="_ref-Hlaváček_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hlaváček" title="">[63]</a></sup> including between 20,487<sup id="_ref-Wlazłowski-numbers_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wlazłowski-numbers" title="">[62]</a></sup> and 21,386<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz-Gusen-numbers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz-Gusen-numbers" title="">[64]</a></sup> in Gusen I, II and III.

During the final months before liberation, the camp&#39;s commander <a href="/wiki/Franz_Ziereis" id="w">Franz Ziereis</a> prepared for its defence against a possible Soviet offensive. Most of the inmates of German and Austrian nationality &#34;volunteered&#34; for the <a href="/wiki/SS-Freiwillige_H%C3%A4ftlingsdivision" id="w">SS-Freiwillige Häftlingsdivision</a>, an SS unit composed mostly of former concentration camp inmates and headed by <a href="/wiki/Oskar_Dirlewanger" id="w">Oskar Dirlewanger</a>. The remaining prisoners were rushed to build a line of granite anti-tank obstacles to the east of Mauthausen. The inmates unable to cope with the hard labour and malnutrition were exterminated in large numbers to free space for newly-arrived evacuation transports from other camps, including most of the sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen located in eastern Austria. In the final months of the war, the main source of calories, that is the parcels of food sent through the <a href="/wiki/International_Red_Cross" id="w">International Red Cross</a>, stopped and food rations became catastrophically low. The prisoners transferred to the &#34;Hospital Sub-camp&#34; received one piece of bread per 20 inmates and roughly half a litre of weed soup a day.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz-food rations_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz-food rations" title="">[65]</a></sup> This made some of the prisoners, previously engaged in various types of resistance activity, begin to prepare plans to defend the camp in case of an SS attempt to exterminate all the remaining inmates. It is not known why the prisoners of Gusen I and II were not exterminated <i>en-masse</i>, despite direct orders from <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler" id="w">Heinrich Himmler</a>; Ziereis&#39; plan assumed rushing all the prisoners into the tunnels of the underground factories of Kellerbau and blowing up the entrances. The plan was known to one of the Polish resistance organizations which started an ambitious plan of gathering tools necessary to dig air vents in the entrances.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_28" id="w">April 28</a>, under cover of a fictional air-raid alarm, some 22,000 prisoners of Gusen were rushed into the tunnels. However, after several hours in the tunnels all of the prisoners were allowed to return to the camp. <a href="/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Dobosiewicz" id="w">Stanisław Dobosiewicz</a>, the author of a monumental monograph of the Mauthausen-Gusen complex explains that one of the possible causes of the failure of the German plan was that the Polish prisoners managed to cut the fuse wires. Ziereis himself stated in his testimony written on <a href="/wiki/May_25" id="w">May 25</a> that it was his wife who convinced him not to follow the order from above.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz-final_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz-final" title="">[66]</a></sup> Although the plan was abandoned, the prisoners feared that the SS might want to massacre the prisoners by other means. Because of that the Polish, Soviet and French prisoners prepared a plan for an assault on the barracks of the SS guards in order to seize the arms necessary to put up a fight. A similar plan was also devised by the Spanish inmates.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz-final_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz-final" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_3" id="w">May 3</a>, the SS and other guards started to prepare for evacuation of the camp. The following day, the guards of Mauthausen were replaced with unarmed <a href="/wiki/Volkssturm" id="w">Volkssturm</a> soldiers and an improvised unit formed of elderly police officers and fire fighters evacuated from Vienna. The police officer in charge of the unit accepted the &#34;inmate self-government&#34; as the camp&#39;s highest authority and <a href="/wiki/Martin_Gerken" id="w">Martin Gerken</a>, until then the highest-ranking kapo prisoner in the Gusen&#39;s administration (in the rank of <i>Lagerälteste</i>, or the <i>Camp&#39;s Elder</i>), became the new <i>de facto</i> commander. He attempted to create an International Prisoner Committee that would become a provisional governing body of the camp until it was liberated by one of the approaching armies, but he was openly accused of co-operation with the SS and the plan failed. All work in the sub-camps of Mauthausen stopped and the inmates focused on preparations for their liberation - or defence of the camps against a possible assault by the SS divisions concentrated in the area.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz-final_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz-final" title="">[66]</a></sup> The remnants of several German divisions indeed assaulted the Mauthausen sub-camp, but were repelled by the prisoners who took over the camp.<sup id="_ref-Żeromski_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Żeromski" title="">[7]</a></sup> Out of all the main sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen only Gusen III was to be evacuated. On <a href="/wiki/May_1" id="w">May 1</a> the inmates were rushed on a <a href="/wiki/Death_march" id="w">death march</a> towards <a href="/wiki/Sankt_Georgen" id="w">Sankt Georgen</a>, but were ordered to return to the camp after several hours. The operation was repeated the following day, but called off soon afterwards. The following day, the SS guards deserted the camp, leaving the prisoners to their fate.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz-final_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz-final" title="">[66]</a></sup>

<p>The camps of Mauthausen-Gusen were the last to be liberated during the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>. On <a href="/wiki/May_5" id="w">May 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>, the camp at Mauthausen was approached by soldiers of the 41st Recon Squad of the <a href="/wiki/US_11th_Armored_Division" id="w">US 11th Armored Division</a>, <a href="/wiki/3rd_US_Army" id="w">3rd US Army</a>. The reconnaissance squad was led by S/SGT Albert J. Kosiek. His troop disarmed the policemen and left the camp. By the time of its liberation, most of the SS-men of Mauthausen had already fled; however, some 30 who were left were lynched by the prisoners;<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz-liberty_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz-liberty" title="">[67]</a></sup> a similar number were lynched in Gusen II.<sup id="_ref-Dobosiewicz-liberty_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dobosiewicz-liberty" title="">[67]</a></sup> Until <a href="/wiki/May_6" id="w">May 6</a> all the remaining sub-camps of the Mauthausen-Gusen camp complex, with the exception of the two camps in the <a href="/wiki/Loibl_Pass" id="w">Loibl Pass</a>, were also liberated by American forces.</p>
<p>Among the inmates liberated from the camp was Lieutenant <a href="/wiki/Jack_Taylor" id="w">Jack Taylor</a>, an officer of the <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services" id="w">Office of Strategic Services</a>.<sup id="_ref-Taylor_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taylor" title="">[68]</a></sup> He had managed to survive with the help of several prisoners and was later a key witness at the <a href="/wiki/Mauthausen-Gusen_camp_trials" id="w">Mauthausen-Gusen camp trials</a> carried out by the <a href="/wiki/Dachau_International_Military_Tribunal" id="w">Dachau International Military Tribunal</a>.<sup id="_ref-Taylor2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taylor2" title="">[69]</a></sup> Another of the camp&#39;s survivors was <a href="/wiki/Simon_Wiesenthal" id="w">Simon Wiesenthal</a>, an engineer who spent the rest of his life hunting Nazi <a href="/wiki/War_criminal" id="w">war criminals</a>.</p>
<p>Following the capitulation of Germany, the Mauthausen-Gusen complex fell within the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_occupation_zone" id="w">Soviet sector of occupation of Austria</a>. Initially, the Soviet authorities used parts of the Mauthausen and Gusen I camps as <a href="/wiki/Barracks" id="w">barracks</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a>. At the same time, the underground factories were being dismantled and sent to the USSR as a war booty. After that, between 1946 and 1947, the camps were unguarded and many furnishings and facilities of the camp were dismantled, both by the Red Army and by the local population. In the early summer of 1947, the Soviet forces had blown the tunnels up and were then withdrawn from the area, while the camp was turned over to Austrian civilian authorities. However, it was not until 1949 that it was declared a national <a href="/wiki/Memorial" id="w">memorial</a> site. Finally, 30 years after camp&#39;s liberation, on <a href="/wiki/May_3" id="w">May 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a>, Chancellor <a href="/wiki/Bruno_Kreisky" id="w">Bruno Kreisky</a> officially opened the Mauthausen Museum.<sup id="_ref-Bischof_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bischof" title="">[2]</a></sup>
Unlike Mauthausen, much of what constituted the sub-camps of Gusen I, II and III is now covered by residential areas built there after the war.<sup id="_ref-Terrance 2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Terrance 2" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
