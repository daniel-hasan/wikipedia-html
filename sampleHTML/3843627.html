It measures {{Ft to m}}, is twelve stories tall and is considered the oldest standing <a href="/wiki/High-rise" id="w">high-rise</a> in Chicago.<sup id="_ref-EMP_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EMP" title="">[1]</a></sup> It has a unique style with exterior load-bearing walls and an interior steel frame.<sup id="_ref-EMP_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EMP" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The lobby was remodeled in 1907 by <a href="/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright" id="w">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>. Starting in 1989, the lobby was again restored to the original Wright design.

<p>The Rookery was built in 1887-1888 by the architectural partnership of <a href="/wiki/Daniel_H._Burnham" id="w">Daniel H. Burnham</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Wellborn_Root" id="w">John Wellborn Root</a>, known as <a href="/wiki/Burnham_and_Root" id="w">Burnham and Root</a>. In the architectural boom that followed the <a href="/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire" id="w">Great Chicago Fire</a>, architects in what would become known as the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_School_(architecture)" id="w">Chicago School</a> of commercial architecture competed with each other to create the world&#39;s first true skyscrapers. By mixing modern building techniques such as metal framing, fireproofing, elevators and plate glass, together with traditional ones such as brick facades and elaborate ornamentation, Burnham and Root sought to create a bold architectural statement that would nonetheless survive as a commercially successful office building.<sup id="_ref-therookery_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-therookery" title="">[4]</a></sup>  This building is one of the few results of their partnership that remains today.<sup id="_ref-PW_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PW" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the master artisan, Root drew upon a variety of influences in designing the interior and exterior spaces, including Moorish, Byzantine, Venetian and Romanesque motifs.<sup id="_ref-therookery_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-therookery" title="">[4]</a></sup> He also provided the architectural innovations that brought together many contemporary cutting edge building techniques. Of particular note was a &#34;floating&#34; foundation - a reinforced concrete slab that provided the building&#39;s weight with a solid platform atop Chicago&#39;s notoriously swampy soil.<sup id="_ref-therookery_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-therookery" title="">[4]</a></sup>  The term for the type of foundation that Root designed is <a href="/wiki/Grillage_foundation" id="w">grillage foundation</a>, a foundation where iron rails and the structural beams are combined in a crisscross pattern and encased in concrete to support the building&#39;s immense weight without heavy foundation stones.<sup id="_ref-EMP_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EMP" title="">[1]</a></sup>  This construction is particularly useful when structural loads are high compared to the natural bearing capacity of the soil.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

</p><a id="Light_court" name="Light_court"></a><h2>Light court</h2>
<p>Young architectural assistant <a href="/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright" id="w">Frank Lloyd Wright</a> was working with <a href="/wiki/Dankmar_Adler" id="w">Adler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Louis_Sullivan" id="w">Sullivan</a> at the time the Rookery was built in 1886. Architect Daniel Burnham was a friend of Wright patron Edward  C. Waller and Waller managed the Rookery; Wright had his offices in the building in 1898-1899. Thus, it is not surprising that Wright received the commission, in 1905, to redesign the lobby in the building; at the time considered the grandest in Chicago.<sup id="_ref-ogorman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ogorman" title="">[7]</a></sup> Wright&#39;s work on the Rookery recast the entryway in his <a href="/wiki/Prairie_style" id="w">Prairie style</a> and added a sense of modernity through his simple but effective lighting design.<sup id="_ref-ogorman_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ogorman" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Among Wright&#39;s most significant alterations was the addition of white <a href="/wiki/Marble" id="w">marble</a> with <a href="/wiki/Persian_architecture" id="w">Persian</a>-style ornamentation. The marble and decorative details added a sense of luxury to the lobby&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Steel" id="w">steel</a>-laden interior, teeming with Burnham and Root&#39;s skeletal metal ribbing.<sup id="_ref-ogorman_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ogorman" title="">[7]</a></sup> The entire interior space is bright and open. A double set of curving, heavily-ornamented stairs wind upward from the lobby&#39;s second floor into the building&#39;s interior. A wrap around <a href="/wiki/Balcony" id="w">balcony</a> on the second floor enhances the feeling of being within the interior of a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Clockwork" id="w">clockwork</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-ogorman_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ogorman" title="">[7]</a></sup> The Wright remodel opened the building up to more of the available light.<sup id="_ref-ogorman_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ogorman" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Making prodigious use of light and ornamentation, the light court served as the focal point for the entire building. Rising two stories, the light court received immediate critical acclaim. &#34;There is nothing bolder, more original or more inspiring in modern civic architecture than its glass-covered court&#34;, wrote Eastern critic Henry Van Brunt.<sup id="_ref-therookery_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-therookery" title="">[4]</a></sup> At a time when Chicago&#39;s bold experiment in architecture was looking eastward for affirmation, this was welcome praise.<sup id="_ref-therookery_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-therookery" title="">[4]</a></sup>  The light court provides natural illumination for the interior offices.<sup id="_ref-PW_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PW" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-PS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PS" title="">[8]</a></sup> Wright&#39;s work on the Rookery is his only work on any building within the downtown cityscape.<sup id="_ref-ogorman_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ogorman" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Renovations" name="Renovations"></a><h2>Renovations</h2>
<p>While much of the Loop&#39;s 19th century architecture has been lost to demolition, the Rookery has been spared this fate through a series of well planned and executed renovations. The building remains a commercially successful rental office building, as it was when it was first built.<sup id="_ref-therookery_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-therookery" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Beginning in the early 20th century, the building underwent three major renovations. In the first, from 1905 to 1907, <a href="/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright" id="w">Frank Lloyd Wright</a> was retained to remake the interior spaces. In keeping with contemporary tastes, Wright&#39;s design covered Root&#39;s elaborate wrought iron finishes with white carved <a href="/wiki/Carrara" id="w">Carrara</a> marble surfaces. Nearing the peak of his fame, Wright&#39;s changes brought enhanced status to the building, making the Rookery one of the most sought after buildings in all of Chicago.<sup id="_ref-therookery_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-therookery" title="">[4]</a></sup> Some of Wright&#39;s other changes included incorporating simplified ironwork and adding planters as well as light fixtures.<sup id="_ref-EMP_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EMP" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second renovation, completed <a href="/wiki/August_24" id="w">August 24</a> <a href="/wiki/1931" id="w">1931</a> by former Wright assistant William Drummond, modernized many of the interior elements, including new elevators, and brought period touches to the building, such as <a href="/wiki/Art_Deco" id="w">Art Deco</a> detailing.<sup id="_ref-ogorman_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ogorman" title="">[7]</a></sup> The third renovation, in 1992, brought the building back much of its original splendor, reopening the light court ceiling after it had been covered over to protect against leaks.<sup id="_ref-therookery_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-therookery" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>After their purchase of the Rookery in <a href="/wiki/October_2007" id="w">October 2007</a> the new owners announced plans for an extensive renovation of the building&#39;s common areas.<sup id="_ref-Trib_20071027_2_1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Trib_20071027_2_1" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Tenants" name="Tenants"></a><h2>Tenants</h2>
<p>Burnham &#38; Root had their offices at the Rookery for a while upon its completion. At one time Wright had an office in the building.<sup id="_ref-EMP_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EMP" title="">[1]</a></sup> Current tenants include <a href="/wiki/US_Bank" id="w">US Bank</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brooks_Brothers" id="w">Brooks Brothers</a>, <a href="/wiki/TVS_Partnership/Architects" id="w">TVS Partnership/Architects</a> and <a href="/wiki/BNP_Paribas" id="w">BNP Paribas</a>, among others.<sup id="_ref-Trib_20071027_2_1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Trib_20071027_2_1" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Current_ownership" name="Current_ownership"></a><h1>Current ownership</h1>
<p>The building was purchased in <a href="/wiki/October" id="w">October</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> for $73 million by an investment group controlled by a European family, and advised by Zeb Bradford of Metzler North America Corp. The seller was Broadway Real Estate Partners of New York, which had bought the Rookery for $56 million in <a href="/wiki/April" id="w">April</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>. BREP was reported to have increased occupancy of the building&#39;s 281,000 sq ft from 80% in <a href="/wiki/January" id="w">January</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> to 96% at the time of the sale.<sup id="_ref-Trib_20071027_2_1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Trib_20071027_2_1" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Cultural_references" name="Cultural_references"></a><h1>Cultural references</h1>
<p>The name <a href="/wiki/Rookery" id="w">Rookery</a> is an allusion to the old city hall building that occupied the land before the Rookery was built.<sup id="_ref-EMP_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EMP" title="">[1]</a></sup> The building was called the Rookery not only in reference to the <a href="/wiki/Crow" id="w">crows</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pigeon" id="w">pigeons</a> that inhabited its exterior walls, but also because of the shady politicians it housed.<sup id="_ref-therookery_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-therookery" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-EMP_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EMP" title="">[1]</a></sup> After the <a href="/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire" id="w">Great Chicago Fire</a> a dilapidated building was used as an interim <a href="/wiki/City_Hall" id="w">City Hall</a> at this location (LaSalle and Adams). However, pigeons became such a nuisance that a complaining citizen began referring to the building as &#34;a rookery&#34;, a term the press quickly adopted. Although several names were considered when a new structure on the site was proposed, &#34;the Rookery&#34; won out.<sup id="_ref-PS_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PS" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Rookery Building was featured in the movie <a href="/wiki/Home_Alone_2:_Lost_in_New_York" id="w">Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</a>, where one of the lower levels was modeled as a toy store, <a href="/wiki/Duncan%26%2339%3Bs_Toy_Chest" id="w">Duncan&#39;s Toy Chest</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
