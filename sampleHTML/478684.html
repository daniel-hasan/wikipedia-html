The <b>Vijayanagara Empire</b> (<a href="/wiki/Kannada_language" id="w">Kannada</a>: ವಿಜಯನಗರ ಸಾಮ್ರಾಜ್ಯ, <a href="/wiki/Telugu_language" id="w">Telugu</a>: విజయనగర సామ్రాజ్యము) was a <a href="/wiki/South_India" id="w">South Indian</a> empire based in the <a href="/wiki/Deccan" id="w">Deccan</a>. Established in 1336 by <a href="/wiki/Harihara_I" id="w">Harihara I</a> and his brother <a href="/wiki/Bukka_Raya_I" id="w">Bukka Raya I</a>, it lasted until  1646 although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the <a href="/wiki/Deccan_sultanates" id="w">Deccan sultanates</a>. The empire is named after its capital city of <a href="/wiki/Vijayanagara" id="w">Vijayanagara</a>, whose impressive ruins surround modern <a href="/wiki/Hampi" id="w">Hampi</a>, now a <a href="/wiki/World_Heritage_Site" id="w">World Heritage Site</a> in modern <a href="/wiki/Karnataka" id="w">Karnataka</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>. The writings of medieval European travelers  such as <a href="/wiki/Domingo_Paes" id="w">Domingo Paes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fernao_Nuniz" id="w">Fernao Nuniz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Da_Conti" id="w">Niccolò Da Conti</a> and the literature in local vernaculars provide crucial information about its history. Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire&#39;s power and wealth.</p>
<p>The empire&#39;s legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known being the group at <a href="/wiki/Hampi" id="w">Hampi</a>. The previous temple building traditions in South India came together in the <a href="/wiki/Vijayanagara_Architecture" id="w">Vijayanagara Architecture</a> style. The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of <a href="/wiki/Hindu" id="w">Hindu</a> temple construction, first in the Deccan and later in the <a href="/wiki/Indian_architecture#Hindu architecture" id="w">Dravidian</a> idioms using the local <a href="/wiki/Granite" id="w">granite</a>. Secular royal structures show the influence of the <a href="/wiki/Sultanate_of_Delhi" id="w">Northern Deccan Sultanate</a> architecture. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies like water management systems for irrigation. The empire&#39;s patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in the languages of <a href="/wiki/Kannada" id="w">Kannada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Telugu_language" id="w">Telugu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tamil_language" id="w">Tamil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sanskrit" id="w">Sanskrit</a>, while <a href="/wiki/Carnatic_music" id="w">Carnatic music</a> evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting <a href="/wiki/Hinduism" id="w">Hinduism</a> as a unifying factor.</p>

Differing theories have been proposed regarding the Vijayanagara empire&#39;s origins.

<p>In the first two decades after the founding of the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the title of <i>Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara</i> (&#34;master of the eastern and western oceans&#34;).

The sudden capture and killing of Aliya Rama Raya in 1565 at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Talikota" id="w">Battle of Talikota</a>, against an alliance of the Deccan sultanates, after a seemingly easy victory for the Vijayanagara armies,  created havoc and confusion in the Vijayanagara ranks, which were then completely routed.  The Sultanates&#39; army later plundered Hampi and reduced it to the ruinous state in which it remains; it was never re-occupied.

All high ranking ministers and officers were required to have military training.<ref name=" title="">[31]</a></sup> A secretariat near the king&#39;s palace  employed <a href="/wiki/Scribes" id="w">scribes</a> and officers to maintain records made official by using a <a href="/wiki/Wax_seal" id="w">wax seal</a> imprinted with the ring of the king.<sup id="_ref-wax_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wax" title="">[32]</a></sup> At the lower administrative levels,  wealthy feudal landlords (<i>Goudas</i>) supervised accountants (<i>Karanikas</i> or <i>Karnam</i>) and guards (<i>Kavalu</i>). The palace administration was divided into 72 departments (<i>Niyogas</i>), each having several female  attendants chosen for their youth and beauty (some imported or captured in victorious battles) who were trained to handle minor administrative matters and to serve  men of nobility as courtesans or concubines.<sup id="_ref-courtesans_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-courtesans" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>The empire was divided into five main provinces (<i>Rajya</i>), each under a commander (<i>Dandanayaka</i> or <i>Dandanatha</i>) and headed by a governor, often from the royal family, who used the  native language for administrative purposes.<sup id="_ref-provinces_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-provinces" title="">[34]</a></sup> A <i>Rajya</i> was divided into  regions (<i>Vishaya</i> <i>Vente</i> or <i>Kottam</i>), and further divided into  counties (<i>Sime</i> or <i>Nadu</i>) themselves subdivided into  municipalities  (<i>Kampana</i> or <i>Sthala</i>). Hereditary families ruled their respective territories and paid tribute to the empire while some areas, such as <a href="/wiki/Keladi_(India)" id="w">Keladi</a> and  <a href="/wiki/Madurai" id="w">Madurai</a>, came under the direct supervision of a commander.</p>
<p>On the battlefields, the king&#39;s commanders led  the troops. The empire&#39;s war strategy  rarely involved massive invasions; more often it employed small scale methods such as  attacking and destroying individual forts. The empire was among the first in India to use long range <a href="/wiki/Artillery" id="w">artillery</a> commonly manned by foreign gunners. (Gunners from present day <a href="/wiki/Turkmenistan" id="w">Turkmenistan</a> were considered the best).<sup id="_ref-gunner_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gunner" title="">[35]</a></sup> Army troops were of two types: The king&#39;s personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory. King Krishnadevaraya&#39;s personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen and over 900 elephants. This number was only a part of the army numbering over 1.1 million soldiers, a figure that varied as an army of two million has also been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by the use of the term <i>Navigadaprabhu</i> (commander of the navy).<sup id="_ref-armysize_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-armysize" title="">[36]</a></sup> The army recruited from all classes  of society (supported by  the collection of additional feudal tributes  from feudatory rulers), and consisted of <a href="/wiki/Archery" id="w">archers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Musket" id="w">musketeers</a> wearing quilted <a href="/wiki/Tunic" id="w">tunics</a>, shieldmen with swords and <a href="/wiki/Poignard" id="w">poignards</a> in their girdles, and soldiers carrying shields so larges that no armour was necessary. The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle.<sup id="_ref-battle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-battle" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>The capital city was completely dependent on the water supply systems constructed to channel and store water, and ensure a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians a picture of the prevailing <a href="/wiki/Surface-water_hydrology" id="w">surface water</a> distribution methods in use at that time in South India&#39;s semiarid regions.<sup id="_ref-water_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-water" title="">[38]</a></sup> Contemporary inscriptions and  notes of foreign travelers describe how huge tanks were constructed by labourers.<sup id="_ref-water1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-water1" title="">[39]</a></sup> Excavations have uncovered the remains of a well-connected water distribution system existing solely within the royal enclosure and the large temple complexes (suggesting it was for the exclusive use of royalty, and for special ceremonies) with sophisticated channels using  gravity  and <a href="/wiki/Siphon" id="w">siphons</a> to <a href="/wiki/Water_transportation" id="w">transport water</a> through <a href="/wiki/Pipeline_transport" id="w">pipelines</a>.<sup id="_ref-water2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-water2" title="">[40]</a></sup> The only structures resembling public waterworks are the remains of large water tanks that collected the seasonal monsoon water and then dried up in summer except for the few fed by springs. In the fertile agricultural areas near the <a href="/wiki/Tungabhadra_River" id="w">Tungabhadra River</a>, canals were dug to guide the river water  into <a href="/wiki/Irrigation_tank" id="w">irrigation tanks</a>. These canals had <a href="/wiki/Sluice" id="w">sluices</a> that were opened and closed to control the water flow. In other areas the administration encouraged the digging of wells  monitored by administrative authorities. Large tanks in the capital city were constructed with royal patronage while smaller tanks were funded by wealthy individuals to gain social and religious merit.</p>

The empire&#39;s economy was largely dependent on  agriculture. Corn (<i>jowar</i>), cotton and <a href="/wiki/Pulse_(legume)" id="w">pulse legumes</a> grew in semi arid regions, while sugarcane, rice and wheat thrived in rainy areas. <a href="/wiki/Betel" id="w">Betel leaves</a>, <a href="/wiki/Areca" id="w">areca</a> (for chewing), and coconut were the  principal cash crops, and large scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire&#39;s vibrant textile industry. Spices such as <a href="/wiki/Turmeric" id="w">turmeric</a>, pepper, <a href="/wiki/Cardamom" id="w">cardamom</a> and ginger grew in the remote <a href="/wiki/Malnad" id="w">Malnad</a> hill region and were transported to the city for trade. The empire&#39;s capital city was a thriving business centre that included a burgeoning  market in large quantities of precious gems and gold.<sup id="_ref-trade_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trade" title="">[41]</a></sup> Prolific temple-building provided employment to thousands of <a href="/wiki/Stone_masonry" id="w">masons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sculpture" id="w">sculptors</a>, and other skilled artisans.</p>
<p>Land ownership was important. Most of the growers were <a href="/wiki/Tenant_farmer" id="w">tenant farmers</a> and were given the right of part ownership of the land over time. Tax policies encouraging needed produce made distinctions between land use to determine tax levies. For example, the daily market availability  of rose petals was important for perfumers, so cultivation of roses received a lower tax assessment.<sup id="_ref-rose_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rose" title="">[42]</a></sup> Salt production and the manufacture of <a href="/wiki/Salt_pan_(evaporation)" id="w">salt pans</a> were controlled by similar means. The making of <a href="/wiki/Ghee" id="w">ghee</a> (clarified butter), which was sold as an oil for human consumption and  as a fuel for lighting lamps, was profitable.<sup id="_ref-Ghee_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ghee" title="">[43]</a></sup> Exports to China intensified and included cotton, spices, jewels, semi-precious stones, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, amber, coral, and  aromatic products such as  perfumes.  Large vessels from China made frequent visits, some captained by the Chinese Admiral <a href="/wiki/Cheng_Ho" id="w">Cheng Ho</a>, and brought Chinese products to the empire&#39;s 300 ports, large and small, on the <a href="/wiki/Arabian_Sea" id="w">Arabian Sea</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal" id="w">Bay of Bengal</a>.

Most information on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The <a href="/wiki/Hindu_caste_system" id="w">Hindu caste system</a> was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set the rules and regulations that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. <a href="/wiki/Untouchability" id="w">Untouchability</a> was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by  leaders (<i>Kaivadadavaru</i>). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka.<sup id="_ref-untouch_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-untouch" title="">[47]</a></sup> The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, <a href="/wiki/Brahmin" id="w">Brahmins</a> enjoyed a high level of respect. With the exception of a few who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters.  Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order.<sup id="_ref-intellectual_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-intellectual" title="">[48]</a></sup> However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as <a href="/wiki/Molla_(poetess)" id="w">Molla</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kanakadasa" id="w">Kanakadasa</a>) and their works (including those of <a href="/wiki/Vemana" id="w">Vemana</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sarvajna" id="w">Sarvajna</a>) is an indication of the degree of social fluidity in the society.</p>
<p>The practice of <a href="/wiki/Sati_(practice)" id="w">Sati</a> was common, though voluntary, and mostly practiced among the upper classes. Over fifty inscriptions attesting to this have been discovered in the Vijayanagara principality alone. These inscriptions are called <i>Satikal</i> (Sati stone) or <i>Sati-virakal</i> (Sati <a href="/wiki/Hero_stone" id="w">hero stone</a>). <i>Satikals</i> commemorated the death of a woman by entering into fire after the death of her husband while <i>Sati-virakals</i> were made for a woman who performed <i>Sati</i> after her husband&#39;s heroic death. Either way, the woman was raised to the level of a demi-goddess and proclaimed by the sculpture of a Sun and crescent moon on the stone.<sup id="_ref-virkal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-virkal" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>The socio-religious movements of the previous centuries, such as <a href="/wiki/Lingayatism" id="w">Lingayatism</a>, provided momentum for flexible social norms to which women were expected to abide.

<p>Well-to-do men wore the <i>Petha</i>or <i>Kulavi</i>, a tall <a href="/wiki/Turban" id="w">turban</a> made of silk and decorated with gold.  As in most Indian societies, jewellery was used by men and women and records describe the use of anklets, bracelets, finger-rings, necklaces and ear rings of various types.

During the rule of the Vijayanagar Empire, poets, scholars and philosophers wrote in Sanskrit and the regional languages, Kannada, Telugu and Tamil and covered such subjects as religion, biography, <i>Prabhanda</i> (fiction), music, grammar, poetry and medicine. The Telugu language  became a popular literary medium, reaching its peak under the patronage of <a href="/wiki/Krishnadevaraya" id="w">Krishnadevaraya</a>.</p>
<p>Most Sanskrit works were commentaries either on the <a href="/wiki/Vedas" id="w">Vedas</a> or on the  <a href="/wiki/Ramayana" id="w">Ramayana</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mahabharata" id="w">Mahabharata</a> epics, written by well known figures such as <a href="/wiki/Sayana" id="w">Sayana</a> and Vidyaranya that extolled the superiority of the <a href="/wiki/Advaita" id="w">Advaita</a> philosophy over other rival Hindu philosophies.<sup id="_ref-advaita_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-advaita" title="">[72]</a></sup> Other writers were famous <a href="/wiki/Dvaita" id="w">Dvaita</a> saints of the <a href="/wiki/Udupi" id="w">Udupi</a> order such as Jayatirtha (earning the title <i>Tikacharya</i> for his polemicial writings),  Vyasatirtha who wrote rebuttals to the Advaita philosophy and of the conclusions of earlier logicians, and Vadirajatirtha and Sripadaraya both of whom criticised the beliefs of <a href="/wiki/Adi_Sankara" id="w">Adi Sankara</a>.<sup id="_ref-critique_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-critique" title="">[73]</a></sup> Apart from these saints, noted Sanskrit scholars adorned the courts of the Vijayanagara kings and their feudatory chiefdoms.

Vijayanagara architecture is  a vibrant
combination of the <a href="/wiki/Chalukya" id="w">Chalukya</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hoysala" id="w">Hoysala</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pandya" id="w">Pandya</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chola" id="w">Chola</a> styles, idioms that prospered in previous centuries.<sup id="_ref-blossom_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blossom" title="">[83]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-blossom1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blossom1" title="">[84]</a></sup>  Its legacy of sculpture, architecture and painting influenced the development of the arts long after the empire came to an end. Its stylistic hallmark  is the ornate <a href="/wiki/Column" id="w">pillared</a> <i>Kalyanamantapa</i> (marriage hall), <i>Vasanthamantapa</i> (open pillared halls) and the <i>Rayagopura</i> (tower). Artisans used the locally available hard granite because of its durability  since the kingdom was under constant threat of invasion. While  the empire&#39;s monuments are spread over the whole of Southern India, nothing surpasses the vast open air theatre of monuments at its capital at <a href="/wiki/Vijayanagara" id="w">Vijayanagara</a>, a <a href="/wiki/UNESCO" id="w">UNESCO</a> <a href="/wiki/World_Heritage_Site" id="w">World Heritage Site</a>.<sup id="_ref-Stones_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stones" title="">[85]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the 14th century the kings continued to build <a href="/wiki/Vesara" id="w">Vesara</a> or Deccan style monuments but later  incorporated dravida-style <a href="/wiki/Gopuram" id="w">gopurams</a> to meet their ritualistic needs. The Prasanna Virupaksha temple (underground temple) of <a href="/wiki/Bukka_Raya_I" id="w">Bukka Raya I</a> and the Hazare Rama temple of Deva Raya I are examples of Deccan architecture.<sup id="_ref-deccan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-deccan" title="">[86]</a></sup> The varied and intricate ornamentation of the pillars is a mark of their work.<sup id="_ref-pillar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pillar" title="">[87]</a></sup> At Hampi, though the <i>Vitthala</i> temple is the best example of their pillared <i>Kalyanamantapa</i> style, the <i>Hazara Ramaswamy</i> temple is a  modest but perfectly finished example.<sup id="_ref-Drama_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Drama" title="">[88]</a></sup> A visible aspect of their style is their return to the  simplistic and serene art developed by the Chalukya dynasty.<sup id="_ref-serene_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-serene" title="">[89]</a></sup> A grand specimen of Vijayanagara art, the <i>Vitthala</i> temple, took several decades to complete during the reign of the Tuluva kings.<sup id="_ref-grand_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-grand" title="">[90]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another element of the Vijayanagara style is the carving of large <a href="/wiki/Monolithic" id="w">monoliths</a> such as the <i>Sasivekalu</i> (mustard) <a href="/wiki/Ganesha" id="w">Ganesha</a> and <i>Kadalekalu</i> (Ground nut) Ganesha at Hampi, the <a href="/wiki/Gomateshwara" id="w">Gomateshwara</a> statues in <a href="/wiki/Karkala" id="w">Karkala</a> and <a href="/wiki/Venur" id="w">Venur</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Nandi" id="w">Nandi</a> bull in <a href="/wiki/Lepakshi" id="w">Lepakshi</a>. The Vijayanagara temples of <a href="/wiki/Bhatkal" id="w">Bhatkal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kanakagiri" id="w">Kanakagiri</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sringeri" id="w">Sringeri</a> and other towns of coastal Karnataka, as well as <a href="/wiki/Tadpatri" id="w">Tadpatri</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lepakshi" id="w">Lepakshi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ahobilam" id="w">Ahobilam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tirupathi_Venkateshwara_Temple" id="w">Tirupati</a> and <a href="/wiki/Srikalahasti" id="w">Srikalahasti</a> in <a href="/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh" id="w">Andhra Pradesh</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Vellore" id="w">Vellore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kumbakonam" id="w">Kumbakonam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kanchi" id="w">Kanchi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Srirangam" id="w">Srirangam</a> in <a href="/wiki/Tamil_Nadu" id="w">Tamil Nadu</a> are examples of this style. Vijayanagara art includes wall-paintings such as <i>Dasavathara</i> (ten <a href="/wiki/Avatars" id="w">avatars</a> of Vishnu) and <i>Girijakalyana</i> (marriage of Goddess <a href="/wiki/Parvati" id="w">Parvati</a>) in the <a href="/wiki/Virupaksha" id="w">Virupaksha</a> temple at Hampi, the <i>Shivapurana</i> paintings (tales of Shiva) at the <a href="/wiki/Virabhadra" id="w">Virabhadra</a> temple at <a href="/wiki/Lepakshi" id="w">Lepakshi</a>, and those at the Jain <i>basadi</i> (temple) and the Kamaskshi and Varadaraja temple at Kanchi.<sup id="_ref-paint_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paint" title="">[91]</a></sup> This mingling of the South Indian styles resulted in a  richness not seen in earlier centuries, a focus on <a href="/wiki/Reliefs" id="w">reliefs</a> in addition to sculpture that surpasses that previously in India.<sup id="_ref-compliments_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-compliments" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>
<p>An aspect of Vijayanagara architecture that shows the cosmopolitanism of the great city is the presence of many secular structures bearing Islamic features. While political history concentrates on the ongoing conflict between the Vijayanagara empire and the Deccan Sultanates, the architectural record reflects a more creative interaction. There are many <a href="/wiki/Arch" id="w">arches</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dome" id="w">domes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vault_(architecture)" id="w">vaults</a> that show these influences. The concentration of structures like <a href="/wiki/Chhatri" id="w">pavilions</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stable" id="w">stables</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tower" id="w">towers</a> suggests they were for use by royalty.<sup id="_ref-deccanstyle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-deccanstyle" title="">[93]</a></sup> The decorative details of these structures may have been absorbed into Vijayanagara architecture during the early 15th century, coinciding with the rule of Deva Raya I and Deva Raya II.  These kings are known to have employed many Muslims in their army and court, some of whom may have been <a href="/wiki/Mughal_architecture" id="w">Muslim architects</a>. This harmonious exchange of architectural ideas must have happened during rare periods of peace between the Hindu and Muslim kingdoms.<sup id="_ref-harmony_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harmony" title="">[94]</a></sup> The &#34;Great Platform&#34; (<i>Mahanavami dibba</i>) has relief carvings in which the figures  seem to have the facial features of central Asian Turks who were known to  have been employed as royal attendants.<sup id="_ref-Turk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turk" title="">[95]</a></sup></p>

Kannada, Telugu and Tamil were used in their respective regions of the empire.
