<p><b><i>&#34;Manos&#34; The Hands of Fate</i></b>, often abbreviated to <b><i>Manos</i></b>, is a 1966 <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Horror_film" id="w">horror film</a> written, directed and produced by <a href="/wiki/El_Paso%2C_Texas" id="w">El Paso</a> fertilizer salesman <a href="/wiki/Harold_P._Warren" id="w">Harold P. Warren</a>. Warren also starred in the film, alongside El Paso theater actors Tom Neyman and John Reynolds. The film is best known for having been featured in a 1993 episode of the television comedy series <i><a href="/wiki/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000" id="w">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></i> (<i>MST3K</i>), a show based on the premise of mocking <a href="/wiki/B-movie" id="w">B-movies</a>, which gave the film <a href="/wiki/Cult_film" id="w">cult status</a>.</p>
<p>The plot of the film revolves primarily around a vacationing family taking a road trip to a hotel. After a long drive in the <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a> desert, the family is trapped at a lodge maintained by a <a href="/wiki/Polygamy" id="w">polygamous</a> <a href="/wiki/Pagan" id="w">pagan</a> cult and they attempt to escape as the cult&#39;s members decide what to do with them.</p>
<p>Produced as a result of a bet, <i>Manos</i> was an independent production by a crew that had little or no background or experience in filmmaking and with a very limited budget at their disposal. Upon its theatrical debut, the film was critically slammed, and remained in obscurity until its <i>Mystery Science Theater</i> appearance. It has since gained infamy as one of <a href="/wiki/Films_considered_the_worst_ever" id="w">the worst films ever made</a>.</p>

The film was the result of a bet Warren made with screenplay writer <a href="/wiki/Stirling_Silliphant" id="w">Stirling Silliphant</a> that he could create a successful horror film on a very limited budget. Warren accumulated a small sum of cash, reportedly $19,000, and hired a group of actors from a local theater and modeling agency.<sup id="_ref-EW1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EW1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Warren promised the cast and crew a share in the film&#39;s profits due to his lack of funds to pay actual wages.<sup id="_ref-Interview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-EW2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EW2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Under the working title <i>The Lodge of Sins</i>, the movie was filmed in the summer of 1966 with a <a href="/wiki/16_mm_film" id="w">16&#160;mm</a> <a href="/wiki/B%C3%B6we_Bell_%26amp%3B_Howell" id="w">Bell &#38; Howell</a> camera which had to be wound by hand and only filmed for 32 seconds. This is credited as a possible explanation for the many editing problems present in the final cut.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The Bell &#38; Howell camera is incapable of <a href="/wiki/Double-system_recording" id="w">double-system recording</a>, and thus all sound effects and dialogue were dubbed later in post-production, reportedly by only three or four people including Warren.<sup id="_ref-Interview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-EW4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EW4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Early in production one of the actresses broke her leg, and Warren rewrote her role to have her make out in a car with an actor during the events of the entire film. The inclusion of these characters has been the focus of criticism for having no apparent connection to the main plot of the film.<sup id="_ref-Interview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-mf_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mf" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>To portray his character <a href="/wiki/Torgo" id="w">Torgo</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Satyr" id="w">satyr</a>, John Reynolds constructed what is described as a metallic rigging worn under his trousers.<sup id="_ref-Interview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-MSTpage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MSTpage" title="">[7]</a></sup> The effect conveyed by his work was to leave his character with oversized knees and difficulty walking.<sup id="_ref-agony2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-agony2" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-I_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-I" title="">[9]</a></sup> Fake <a href="/wiki/Cloven-hoof" id="w">cloven hooves</a> were also made by Reynolds for his costume, but they are difficult to see on screen, especially in the <i>Mystery Science Theater</i> version.<sup id="_ref-Interview_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Night time proved hard for Warren to work with (for whatever reason, Warren chose not to use the normal technique of <a href="/wiki/Day_for_night" id="w">shooting day-for-night</a>). In many of the night scenes, the camera and lights attracted swarms of <a href="/wiki/Moth" id="w">moths</a>, which can be seen in the film&#39;s final production.<sup id="_ref-BadMovies_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BadMovies" title="">[10]</a></sup> Also, in the scene in which the cops &#34;investigate&#34; Mike&#39;s gunfire, they could only walk a few feet forward, as there wasn&#39;t enough light to illuminate the scenery for a panning shot.<sup id="_ref-Interview_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-IMDB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IMDB" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Post production efforts were reportedly minimal, despite promises by Warren that any problems in the film would be fixed in later editing.<sup id="_ref-Interview_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-MSTpage_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MSTpage" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-interview2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview2" title="">[12]</a></sup> One of the more visible examples of this is a brief moment at the beginning of the film in which the <a href="/wiki/Clapperboard" id="w">clapboard</a> is visible after a cut to the &#34;make-out couple&#34; (to add insult to injury, the clapboard was not even necessary because there was no sound on set).<sup id="_ref-agony2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-agony2" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-I_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-I" title="">[9]</a></sup> It is rumored that the entire opening sequence, which consisted of the main characters driving around looking for their hotel for minutes on end with minimal dialogue or effect on the plot, was the result of such neglect. Warren had intended to include <a href="/wiki/Opening_credits" id="w">opening credits</a> at this stage of the film, but forgot or was unable to add them.<sup id="_ref-mf_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mf" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-IMDB_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IMDB" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Reportedly, Warren&#39;s small crew became so bemused by his amateurishness and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Irascible">irascibility</a> that they derisively called the movie <i>Mangos, the Cans of Fruit</i> behind his back.<sup id="_ref-Interview_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-MSTpage_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MSTpage" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-IMDB_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IMDB" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h1>Plot</h1>
<p>The film opens with footage of Michael (<a href="/wiki/Harold_P._Warren" id="w">Warren</a>), his wife Margaret (Diane Mahree), their young daughter Debbie (Jackey Neyman Jones) and their dog, Peppy, on a driving holiday, searching for the &#34;Valley Lodge&#34;. There are also scenes in this sequence involving a teenage couple who are <a href="/wiki/Necking" id="w">necking</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Convertible" id="w">convertible</a>. They are interrupted by a police officer, who tells them to move their car. In the meantime, Michael and his family finally reach a house which is tended by a bizarre, <a href="/wiki/Satyr" id="w">satyr</a>-like person named <a href="/wiki/Torgo" id="w">Torgo</a> (John Reynolds) with an erratic, repetitive speech pattern.  He frequently refers to someone called &#34;the Master&#34; as the apparent owner of the house.  Michael and Margaret ask Torgo for directions to Valley Lodge;  Torgo simply replies that, &#34;<i>There is no way out of here. It&#39;ll be dark soon. There is no way out of here.</i>&#34; With this information, Michael asks Torgo to let him and his family stay the night, despite objections from both Torgo and Margaret. Torgo ultimately relents. Inside the home, the two visitors see a disturbing painting of a dark, malevolent-looking man and a black dog with glowing eyes. Torgo identifies the man as &#34;the Master&#34;, whom he describes as being away, but &#34;<i>not dead the way you know it.</i>&#34;</p>
<p>Peppy then runs outside, barking continuously for a while, before falling silent. Michael investigates, retrieving a <a href="/wiki/Flashlight" id="w">flashlight</a> and <a href="/wiki/Revolver" id="w">revolver</a> from his car. He discovers that the dog has been killed by an unknown force. When informed of this, Margaret demands they leave, and Michael orders Torgo to put the luggage back in the car. Torgo does this, but has developed an attraction to Margaret. He confronts her and crudely <a href="/wiki/Groping" id="w">gropes</a> her hair. He tells her that, although she is doomed to become yet another bride of the Master, he intends to keep her for himself. Margaret threatens to tell Michael of Torgo&#39;s advances, but Torgo convinces her not to say anything to her husband by promising to protect her. Michael then returns, unable to start the car. With the revelation that there are no phones at the home, Torgo brings the luggage back into the room.</p>

<div class="framecaption">An image from the inexplicably unconnected plotline of the &#34;make-out couple&#34;, highlighted to show a failure to edit out the clapboard.</div> film returns to the teenage couple who were seen earlier. They are still petting, in the middle of the night, and are sent on their way by the same policeman as before, who is joined by his partner. The teenagers mention a second couple (Michael and Margaret) who they had seen driving on the road earlier.</p>
<p>At the lodge, Debbie leaves unexpectedly to search for her dog. A frightened Michael and Margaret find her leading the dog seen in the painting. Debbie releases the dog and runs to her parents, who tell her to never run away again. The parents ask where she found the dog, and Debbie leads them to a tomb-like structure where &#34;The Master&#34; (Tom Neyman) and several women dressed in translucent night gowns, later revealed to be his wives, lie in slumber. In horror, the family runs back to the house, and Michael leaves to seek an explanation from Torgo.</p>
<p>Torgo has gone to the tomb himself, where he fondles the wives and berates the sleeping Master before knocking out Michael, tying him to a pole, and returning to the house to sleep. The Master suddenly comes to life and wakes his wives, and a short argument over the fate of the family ensues. One faction of the Master&#39;s wives wants to sacrifice the family whole; another faction prefers to spare Michael&#39;s wife and daughter. The Master angrily stops the argument, and decides to sacrifice Torgo (whose earlier rantings he could hear, even though he appeared unconscious) and his first wife to the film&#39;s mysterious <a href="/wiki/Deity" id="w">deity</a> and namesake, &#34;Manos&#34;. He then makes his way back to the house to find Torgo. While the Master is gone, the women continue arguing over whether or not to kill Debbie, as well as who has the Master&#39;s favor. The argument soon degenerates into a fight, and the women wrestle in the sand for several minutes. </p>
<p>The Master confronts Torgo in the home, where he informs Torgo of his fate. Torgo offers some resistance, but ultimately succumbs to what appears to be a hypnotic spell by the Master. At the same time one of the Master&#39;s wives leaves the tomb, and appears to kiss and then slap the unconscious Michael. She then warns the Master of the unexpected brawl that has begun, and the two return with Torgo to the tomb. The Master stops the fight, and then has his first wife tied to a pole to be sacrificed. Torgo is then laid on a stone bed, where the wives subject him to what one El Paso reviewer likened at the time to &#34;Torgo being massaged to death&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Interview_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-EW4_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EW4" title="">[5]</a></sup> This in itself does not prove fatal. The Master then evokes some mysterious power, severing and horribly burning Torgo&#39;s left hand. Torgo runs off into the darkness, his fate unknown. The Master then orders the family to be found. In a scene cut from the <i>Mystery Science Theater</i> airing, the Master also sacrifices his first wife.</p>
<p>Michael regains consciousness and rejoins the family. They attempt to escape, but encounter a <a href="/wiki/Rattlesnake" id="w">rattlesnake</a>, which is rendered via <a href="/wiki/Stock_footage" id="w">stock footage</a>.<sup id="_ref-Interview_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[2]</a></sup> Michael opens fire at the snake, which alerts the policemen who had been shown earlier. However, the policemen decide not to investigate the shooting, claiming it could be across the Mexican border. Michael and his family decide to go back to the home, and barricade themselves in one of the rooms. The Master confronts them. Michael fires several shots into the Master&#39;s face, at <a href="/wiki/Point-blank_range" id="w">point-blank range</a>, but they have no effect. The screen fades to black, indicating that the Master has again applied his hypnotic power.</p>
<p>The film ends with a coda involving two girls, driving in a convertible. They become lost, and stop at the home to ask for directions. They are greeted by an entranced Michael. A number of <a href="/wiki/Jump_cut" id="w">jump cuts</a> show us the fate of Margaret and Debbie: like the other wives of the Master, they sleep in the tomb, dressed in flowing white robes. The film concludes with Michael saying, &#34;I take care of the place while the Master is away,&#34; just as Torgo had done when first seen. The production credits are superimposed over what Joel describes in the <i>MST3K</i> cut as outtakes from the film with the words &#34;The End?&#34; on the screen at the very end.</p>
<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h1>Reception</h1>
<p>The film premiered on <a href="/wiki/November_15" id="w">November 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1966" id="w">1966</a>, at the Capri Theater in Warren&#39;s hometown of <a href="/wiki/El_Paso%2C_Texas" id="w">El Paso, Texas</a>. Warren arranged for a searchlight to be used at the cinema,<sup id="_ref-Interview_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[2]</a></sup> and for the cast to be brought to the premiere by a limousine, in order to enhance the Hollywood feel of the event. Only a single limousine could be afforded, however, and as a result the driver had to drop off one group, then drive around the block and pick up another.<sup id="_ref-EW3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EW3" title="">[13]</a></sup> The premiere was also attended by numerous local dignitaries, including the Mayor and local Sheriff. Shortly after the film began, the audience began laughing at its poor quality and redundant dialogue. Humiliated, Warren and the rest of his cast made a hasty exit. The film ended to a mixture of laughter and applause. In light of the film&#39;s reception, Warren suggested that <i>Manos</i> might make a passable comedy if redubbed.<sup id="_ref-Interview_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The film was briefly distributed by <a href="/wiki/Emerson_Releasing_Corporation" id="w">Emerson Releasing Corporation</a>. Reports that the only crew members who were compensated for their work in the film were Jackey Neyman Jones and her family&#39;s dog, who received a bicycle and a large quantity of <a href="/wiki/Dog_food" id="w">dog food</a> respectively, would indicate that the film failed to break even financially.<sup id="_ref-Interview_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-interview2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview2" title="">[12]</a></sup> Official box office figures for the film are currently unknown, if indeed they ever existed.</p>
<p>The <i>MST3K</i> version of the episode was released on DVD on its own in 2001, and in the <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000 Essentials</i> collection in 2004.<sup id="_ref-dvdreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvdreview" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> A DVD of the original version of <i>Manos</i> has also been made available through <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Video" id="w">Alpha Video</a>,<sup id="_ref-Aplha_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Aplha" title="">[16]</a></sup> who also released original versions of other &#34;MST-ed&#34; films including <i><a href="/wiki/Teenagers_From_Outer_Space" id="w">Teenagers From Outer Space</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-TeenAlpha_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TeenAlpha" title="">[17]</a></sup> Reportedly, <a href="/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino" id="w">Quentin Tarantino</a> owns a rare <a href="/wiki/35_mm" id="w">35&#160;mm</a> copy of the film and has stated that this film is his favorite &#34;<a href="/wiki/Comedy" id="w">comedy</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-IMDB_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IMDB" title="">[11]</a></sup> In attempting to explain the film&#39;s appeal, the <i><a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" id="w">Los Angeles Times</a></i> hypothesized, &#34;After screening <i>Manos</i> for probably the 10th time, I&#39;ve concluded it has to do with intimacy. Because it is such a pure slice of Warren&#39;s brain—he wrote, directed, produced and starred, and brooked no collaboration—<i>Manos</i> amounts to the man&#39;s cinematically transfigured subconscious.&#34;<sup id="_ref-LAtimes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LAtimes" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Two humorous stage adaptations of the film have been made.

<p>Despite its newly gained cult popularity, the general opinion on the quality of the film remains much the same.
