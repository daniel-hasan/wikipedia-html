<p><b>Thomas Dale DeLay</b> (born <a href="/wiki/April_8" id="w">April 8</a> <a href="/wiki/1947" id="w">1947</a>) is a former member of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">United States House of Representatives</a> from <a href="/wiki/Sugar_Land%2C_Texas" id="w">Sugar Land</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a>. He was <a href="/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">House Majority Leader</a> 2003–2006 and is a prominent <a href="/wiki/American_conservatism" id="w">conservative</a> member of the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Republican Party</a>.</p>
<p>DeLay was first elected to the House in 1984. He became known as &#34;The Hammer&#34; for his enforcement of party discipline in close votes and his reputation for taking political retribution on opponents. He was appointed <a href="/wiki/Party_whips_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Deputy Minority Whip</a> in 1988 and was elected <a href="/wiki/Party_whips_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">House Majority Whip</a> in 1995 after helping <a href="/wiki/Newt_Gingrich" id="w">Newt Gingrich</a> to lead the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Revolution" id="w">Republican Revolution</a>. In the 1990s, he helped to start the <a href="/wiki/K_Street_Project" id="w">K Street Project</a>, an effort to pressure <a href="/wiki/Lobbying" id="w">lobbying</a> firms to hire Republicans to top positions. He was a driving force behind the <a href="/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton" id="w">impeachment</a> of President <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" id="w">Bill Clinton</a> in 1998. DeLay was elected House Majority Leader after the <a href="/wiki/U.S._House_election%2C_2002" id="w">2002 midterm elections</a>, and compelled House Republicans to unite to an unprecedented degree, especially in support of President <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">George W. Bush</a>&#39;s agenda.  
In the early 2000s, DeLay helped to coordinate efforts to <a href="/wiki/2003_Texas_redistricting" id="w">redistrict congressional districts</a> in Texas to favor the election of more Republicans. </p>
<p>In 2005, a Texas <a href="/wiki/Grand_jury" id="w">grand jury</a> <a href="/wiki/Indictment" id="w">indicted</a> DeLay on criminal charges that he had conspired to violate <a href="/wiki/Campaign_finance" id="w">campaign finance</a> laws during that period. DeLay denied the charges, saying that they were politically motivated, but <a href="/wiki/Republican_Conference_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Republican Conference</a> rules forced him to resign temporarily from his position as Majority Leader. In January 2006, under pressure from fellow Republicans, DeLay announced that he would not seek to return to the position. In the months before and after this decision, two of his former aides were convicted in the <a href="/wiki/Jack_Abramoff_Indian_lobbying_scandal" id="w">Jack Abramoff scandal</a>. DeLay ran for re-election in <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_elections%2C_2006" id="w">2006</a>, and won the Republican <a href="/wiki/Primary_election" id="w">primary election</a> in March 2006, but, citing the possibility of losing the general election, he announced in April 2006 that he would withdraw from the race and resign his seat in Congress. He resigned on <a href="/wiki/June_9" id="w">June 9</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, and sought to remove his name from the ballot. The court battle that followed forced him to remain on the ballot, despite having withdrawn from the race.  </p>
<p>After all the judicial wrangling<a class="externallink" href="http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/8/8/143020.shtml?s=ic" rel="nofollow" title="http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/8/8/143020.shtml?s=ic">http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/8/8/143020.shtml?s=ic</a>, DeLay&#39;s name was not on the ballot on election day.  There were two elections for the House seat, a special election to fill the vacancy created by DeLay&#39;s resignation and the general election for the 110th Congress. </p>
<p>In the general election there were three main candidates. Democrat and former US Representative Nick Lampson, Libertarian Party candidate Bob Smither, and Republican Sekula-Gibbs. Only Lampson&#39;s and Smither&#39;s names appeared on the ballot, as Shelley Sekula-Gibbs had to run as a write-in candidate because DeLay had previously won the Republican primary. <a href="/wiki/Texas%26%2339%3Bs_22nd_congressional_district_elections%2C_2006" id="w">Election Results</a></p>
<a id="Biography_and_early_political_career" name="Biography_and_early_political_career"></a><h1>Biography and early political career</h1>
<p>DeLay was born in <a href="/wiki/Laredo%2C_Texas" id="w">Laredo, Texas</a>. He spent part of his childhood in <a href="/wiki/Venezuela" id="w">Venezuela</a>, due to his father&#39;s work in the <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" id="w">petroleum</a> and <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" id="w">natural gas</a> industry. He later attended Calallen High School in <a href="/wiki/Corpus_Christi%2C_Texas" id="w">Corpus Christi, Texas</a>, and spent two years as a pre-med student at <a href="/wiki/Baylor_University" id="w">Baylor University</a> before he was expelled for drinking and <a href="/wiki/Vandalism" id="w">vandalism</a> — DeLay was caught painting a building at rival <a href="/wiki/Texas_A%26amp%3BM_University" id="w">Texas A&#38;M University</a> green and gold, Baylor&#39;s colors. DeLay married Christine Furrh, whom he had known since high school, in 1967. The DeLays had a daughter, Danielle, in 1972.</p>
<p>DeLay received a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science" id="w">Bachelor of Science</a> <a href="/wiki/Academic_degree" id="w">degree</a> with a major in biology from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Houston" id="w">University of Houston</a> in 1970. He spent three years working for Redwood Chemical. This work was the source for his nickname &#34;the Exterminator&#34;. In the eleven years DeLay ran the company, the <a href="/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service" id="w">IRS</a> imposed <a href="/wiki/Tax_lien" id="w">tax liens</a> on him three times for not paying payroll and income taxes.<sup id="_ref-absolutetruth_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-absolutetruth" title="">[1]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" id="w">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a>&#39;s ban on a certain <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" id="w">pesticide</a> that was used in extermination work led DeLay to oppose government regulation of businesses, a belief that he has carried with him throughout his political career.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1978, DeLay won the election for an open seat in the <a href="/wiki/Texas_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Texas House of Representatives</a>. He was the first Republican to represent <a href="/wiki/Fort_Bend_County%2C_Texas" id="w">Fort Bend County</a> in the state House. During his time in the Texas Legislature, he struggled with <a href="/wiki/Alcoholism" id="w">alcoholism</a> and gained a reputation as a playboy, earning the nickname &#34;Hot Tub Tom&#34;.  By the time of his election to Congress, he drank &#34;eight, ten, twelve <a href="/wiki/Martini_cocktail" id="w">martinis</a> a night at receptions and fundraisers.&#34;<sup id="_ref-absolutetruth_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-absolutetruth" title="">[1]</a></sup> In 1985, DeLay became a <a href="/wiki/Born_again" id="w">born-again Christian</a>, and later gave up hard liquor. He has stated that he &#34;was no longer committing <a href="/wiki/Adultery" id="w">adultery</a> by [the time of] the impeachment trial&#34; in 1998.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> In 1994, Christine DeLay began volunteering as a court-appointed special advocate for children in <a href="/wiki/Foster_care" id="w">foster care</a>, and soon thereafter, the DeLays became foster parents to three teenage boys.</p>
<p>DeLay has declined to comment on reports in <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Yorker" id="w">The New Yorker</a></i> that he is estranged from much of his family, including his mother and one of his brothers.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> DeLay has not spoken to his younger brother, Randy, a <a href="/wiki/Houston%2C_Texas" id="w">Houston</a> lobbyist, since 1996, when a complaint to the <a href="/wiki/U.S._House_Committee_on_Standards_of_Official_Conduct" id="w">House Ethics Committee</a> prompted Tom DeLay to cut his brother off in order to avoid the appearance of a <a href="/wiki/Conflict_of_interest" id="w">conflict of interest</a>.<sup id="_ref-absolutetruth_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-absolutetruth" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>DeLay was elected to the House in <a href="/wiki/U.S._House_election%2C_1984" id="w">1984</a>, representing the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives%2C_Texas_District_22" id="w">Texas 22nd congressional district</a>, after his predecessor, Republican <a href="/wiki/Ron_Paul" id="w">Ron Paul</a>, declined to run for re-election to run in the Republican primary for the 1984 <a href="/wiki/U.S._Senate" id="w">U.S. Senate</a> race.</p>
<a id="Early_Congressional_career" name="Early_Congressional_career"></a><h1>Early Congressional career</h1>
<p>As a member of the Republican minority in the 1980s, DeLay made a name for himself by criticizing the <a href="/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Arts" id="w">National Endowment for the Arts</a> and the Environmental Protection Agency. During his first term in Congress, DeLay was appointed to the Republican Committee on Committees, which assigned representatives to <a href="/wiki/House_committee" id="w">House committees</a>, and in his second term, he was appointed to the powerful <a href="/wiki/House_Appropriations_Committee" id="w">House Appropriations Committee</a>, a position that he retained until his election as Majority Leader in 2003. He was reappointed to the committee in 2006 after leaving his position as Majority Leader. He also served for a time as chairman of a group of conservative House Republicans known as the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Study_Committee" id="w">Republican Study Committee</a>, and as secretary of the Republican Conference.</p>
<p>No one close to DeLay corroborated that DeLay attempted to serve. <i>The Washington Post</i> reported that he had received student deferments while at Baylor and had kept the deferment after his expulsion from Baylor in 1967. He received a high <a href="/wiki/Draft_lottery_(1969)" id="w">draft lottery</a> number in 1969, and graduated from University of Houston in 1970.</p>
<p>DeLay was appointed deputy whip by then-<a href="/wiki/Minority_Whip_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Minority</a> <a href="/wiki/Whip_(politics)" id="w">Whip</a> <a href="/wiki/Dick_Cheney" id="w">Dick Cheney</a> in 1988. When the Republican Party gained control of the House in 1995 following the <a href="/wiki/U.S._House_election%2C_1994" id="w">1994 election</a>, DeLay was elected <a href="/wiki/Majority_Whip_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Majority Whip</a> against the wishes of <a href="/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">House Speaker</a>-elect <a href="/wiki/Newt_Gingrich" id="w">Newt Gingrich</a>.</p>
<p>DeLay was not always on good terms with Gingrich or <a href="/wiki/Dick_Armey" id="w">Dick Armey</a>, the House Majority Leader from 1995 to 2003, and he reportedly considered them uncommitted to <a href="/wiki/Christian_values" id="w">Christian values</a>. In 1997 DeLay unsuccessfully tried to remove Gingrich from his position as Speaker. Nevertheless, in the heyday of the 104th Congress (1995–1997), DeLay described the Republican leadership as a <a href="/wiki/Triumvirate" id="w">triumvirate</a> of Gingrich, &#34;the visionary&#34;; Armey, &#34;the <a href="/wiki/Policy_wonk" id="w">policy wonk</a>&#34;; and himself, &#34;the ditch digger who makes it all happen&#34;.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In keeping with his opposition to environmental regulation, DeLay criticized proposals to phase out the use of <a href="/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon" id="w">chlorofluorocarbons</a> (CFCs), which lead to the depletion of the <a href="/wiki/Ozone_layer" id="w">ozone layer</a>. In 1995, DeLay introduced a bill to revoke the CFC ban and to repeal provisions of the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Air_Act" id="w">Clean Air Act</a> dealing with stratospheric ozone, arguing that the science underlying the ban was debatable.</p>
<p>As Majority Whip, DeLay earned the nickname &#34;The Hammer&#34; for his enforcement of party discipline in close votes and his reputation for wreaking political vengeance on opponents. DeLay has expressed a liking for his nickname, pointing out that the <a href="/wiki/Hammer" id="w">hammer</a> is one of a <a href="/wiki/Carpenter" id="w">carpenter</a>&#39;s most valuable tools.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> In the 104th Congress, DeLay successfully whipped 300 out of 303 bills.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1998, DeLay worked to ensure that the House vote on impeaching President <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" id="w">Bill Clinton</a> was successful.<sup id="_ref-absolutetruth_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-absolutetruth" title="">[1]</a></sup> DeLay rejected efforts to <a href="/wiki/Censure" id="w">censure</a> Clinton, who, DeLay said, had lied under oath.<sup id="_ref-bigpush_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bigpush" title="">[8]</a></sup> DeLay believed that the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Constitution" id="w">U.S. Constitution</a> allowed the House to punish the president only through impeachment. He called on Clinton to resign and personally compelled enough House members to vote to approve two articles of impeachment.<sup id="_ref-bigpush_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bigpush" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Contributions_from_Russian_oil_executives" name="Contributions_from_Russian_oil_executives"></a><h2>Contributions from Russian oil executives</h2>
<p>In December 2005, the <i>Washington Post</i> reported that, in 1998, a group of <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russian</a> oil executives had given money to a nonprofit advocacy group run by a former DeLay staffer and funded by clients of <a href="/wiki/Lobbyist" id="w">lobbyist</a> <a href="/wiki/Jack_Abramoff" id="w">Jack Abramoff</a> in an attempt to influence DeLay&#39;s vote on an <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" id="w">International Monetary Fund</a> bailout of the Russian economy.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Associates of DeLay advisor <a href="/wiki/Ed_Buckham" id="w">Ed Buckham</a>, the founder of the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Family_Network" id="w">U.S. Family Network</a>, said that executives from the oil firm <a href="/wiki/Naftasib" id="w">Naftasib</a> had offered a donation of $1,000,000 to be delivered to a <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>-area airport in order to secure DeLay&#39;s support. On <a href="/wiki/June_25" id="w">June 25</a> <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a>, the U.S. Family Network received a $1 million check via money transferred through the London law firm James &#38; Sarch Co. This payment was the largest single entry on U.S. Family Network&#39;s donor list. The original source of the donation was not recorded.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> DeLay denied that the payment had influenced his vote. Naftasib denied that it had made the payment and that it had ever been represented by James &#38; Sarch Co. The now-dissolved law firm&#39;s former partners declined to comment due to confidentiality requirements.</p>
<a id="Settlement_in_civil_suit" name="Settlement_in_civil_suit"></a><h2>Settlement in civil suit</h2>
<p>In early 1999, the <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Republic" id="w">The New Republic</a></i> picked up a story, first reported by Houston-area alternative weeklies, alleging that DeLay had committed <a href="/wiki/Perjury" id="w">perjury</a> during a civil lawsuit brought against him by a former business partner in 1994.</p>
<p>The plaintiff in that suit, Robert Blankenship, charged that DeLay and a third partner in Albo Pest Control had breached the partnership agreement by trying to force him out of the business without buying him out. Blankenship filed suit, charging DeLay and the other partner with breach of <a href="/wiki/Fiduciary_duty" id="w">fiduciary duty</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fraud" id="w">fraud</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wrongful_termination" id="w">wrongful termination</a>, and loss of <a href="/wiki/Corporate_expectancy" id="w">corporate expectancy</a>. While being <a href="/wiki/Deposition_(law)" id="w">deposed</a> in that suit, DeLay claimed that he did not think that he was an officer or <a href="/wiki/Board_of_directors" id="w">director</a> of Albo and that he believed that he had resigned two or three years previously.<sup id="_ref-absolutetruth_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-absolutetruth" title="">[1]</a></sup> However, his congressional disclosure forms, including one filed subsequent to the deposition, stated that he was either president or chairman of the company between 1985 and 1994. Blankenship also alleged that Albo money had been spent on DeLay&#39;s congressional campaigns, in violation of federal and state law.</p>
<p>DeLay and Blankenship <a href="/wiki/Settlement_(law)" id="w">settled</a> for an undisclosed sum. Blankenship&#39;s attorney said that had he known about the congressional disclosure forms, he would have referred the case to the <a href="/wiki/Harris_County%2C_Texas" id="w">Harris County</a> district attorney&#39;s office for a perjury prosecution. DeLay has never been charged with a crime in connection with this case.</p>
<a id="Majority_Leader" name="Majority_Leader"></a><h1>Majority Leader</h1>

<p>After serving as his party&#39;s Whip for eight years, DeLay was elected Majority Leader upon the retirement of <a href="/wiki/Dick_Armey" id="w">Dick Armey</a> in 2003. His tenure as Majority Leader was marked by strong Republican party discipline and by parliamentary and redistricting efforts to preserve Republican control of the House.</p>
<p>After being indicted on <a href="/wiki/September_28" id="w">September 28</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, DeLay stepped down from his position as Majority Leader. He was the first congressional leader ever to be indicted.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Rep. <a href="/wiki/Roy_Blunt" id="w">Roy Blunt</a> of Missouri took over as acting leader.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/January_7" id="w">January 7</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, after weeks of growing pressure from Republican colleagues, and particularly from Reps. <a href="/wiki/Charlie_Bass" id="w">Charlie Bass</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Flake" id="w">Jeff Flake</a>,<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> who wanted to avoid being associated with DeLay&#39;s legal issues in an election year, DeLay announced that he would not seek to regain his position as Majority Leader.</p>
<a id="Legislative_and_electoral_methods" name="Legislative_and_electoral_methods"></a><h2>Legislative and electoral methods</h2>
<p>DeLay was known to &#34;primary&#34; Republicans who resisted his votes (i.e., to threaten to endorse and to support a Republican <a href="/wiki/Primary_election" id="w">primary</a> challenge to the disobedient representative),<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> and, like many of his predecessors in Congress, used promises of future committee chairmanships to bargain for support among the rank-and-file members of the party.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Employing a method known as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Catch_and_release_(congress)" id="w">catch and release</a>,&#34; DeLay allowed <a href="/wiki/Centrist" id="w">centrist</a> or moderately conservative Republicans to take turns voting against controversial bills. If a representative said that a bill was unpopular in his district, then DeLay would ask him to vote for it only if his vote were necessary for passage; if his vote were not needed, then the representative would be able to vote against the party without reprisal.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>In the 108th Congress, a preliminary <a href="/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)" id="w">Medicare</a> vote passed 216-215, a vote on <a href="/wiki/Head_Start" id="w">Head Start</a> passed 217-216, a vote on <a href="/wiki/School_voucher" id="w">school vouchers</a> for Washington, D.C. passed 209-208, and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Fast_track" id="w">Fast track</a>,&#34; usually called &#34;trade promotion authority&#34;, passed by one vote as well. Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay&#39;s ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as &#34;growing the vote&#34;.</p>
<p>DeLay was also noted for involving lobbyists in the process of passing House bills. One lobbyist said, &#34;I&#39;ve had members pull me aside and ask me to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I&#39;ve never been asked to work on a bill — at least like they are asking us to whip bills now.&#34;<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>DeLay&#39;s ability to raise money gave him additional influence. During the 2004 election cycle, DeLay&#39;s political action committee ARMPAC was one of the top contributors to Republican congressional candidates, contributing over $980,000 in total.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Partly as a result of DeLay&#39;s management abilities, the House Republican caucus under him displayed unprecedented, sustained party cohesion.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_30" id="w">September 30</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay because he &#34;offered to endorse Representative <a href="/wiki/Nick_Smith_(U.S._politician)" id="w">[Nick] Smith</a>&#39;s son in exchange for Representative Smith&#39;s vote in favor of the <a href="/wiki/Medicare_Prescription_Drug%2C_Improvement%2C_and_Modernization_Act" id="w">Medicare bill</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 2001, DeLay defied President George W.

<p>DeLay is <a href="/wiki/Pro-life" id="w">pro-life</a>.<sup id="_ref-absolutetruth_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-absolutetruth" title="">[1]</a></sup> In 2005, he voted 100% in line with the views of the National Right-to-Life Committee and 0% with the <a href="/wiki/National_Abortion_Reproductive_Rights_Action_League" id="w">National Abortion Reproductive Rights Action League</a>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>DeLay supported the <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy_Abuse_Prevention_and_Consumer_Protection_Act_of_2005" id="w">Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005</a>. Critics of this law argued that it unduly favors creditors over consumers, and noted that the <a href="/wiki/Credit_card" id="w">credit card</a> industry spent millions of dollars lobbying in support of the act.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2004, the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay for his actions related to a 2002 energy bill. A Committee memo stated that DeLay &#34;created the appearance that donors were being provided with special access to Representative DeLay regarding the then-pending energy legislation.&#34;<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2005, DeLay, acting against the president&#39;s wishes, initiated the &#34;safe harbor&#34; provision for <a href="/wiki/MTBE" id="w">MTBE</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005" id="w">Energy Policy Act of 2005</a>, together with Rep. <a href="/wiki/Joe_Barton" id="w">Joe Barton</a>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> This provision would have retroactively protected the makers of the gasoline additive from lawsuits.

<p>DeLay opposes the teaching of the theory of evolution. After the <a href="/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre" id="w">Columbine High School massacre</a>, he entered into the congressional record a statement saying that shootings happened in part &#34;because our school systems teach our children that they are nothing but glorified apes who have evolutionized [<i>sic</i>] out of some primordial soup of mud.&#34;<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Foreign_policy" name="Foreign_policy"></a><h2>Foreign policy</h2>
<p>DeLay has been a strong supporter of the State of <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israel</a>, saying, &#34;The Republican leadership, especially that leadership in the House, has made pro-Israel policy a fundamental component of our <a href="/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_the_United_States" id="w">foreign policy</a> agenda and it drives the Democrat [<i>sic</i>] leadership crazy — because they just can’t figure out why we do it!&#34;<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> In a 2002 speech, DeLay promised to &#34;use every tool at my disposal to ensure that the Republican Conference, and the House of Representatives, continues to preserve and strengthen America&#39;s alliance with the State of Israel.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>On a 2003 trip to Israel, DeLay toured the nation and addressed members of the <a href="/wiki/Knesset" id="w">Knesset</a>.

<p>In 2005, in a snub to the Bush administration, DeLay was the &#34;driving force behind the rejection of direct aid&#34; to the <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_Authority" id="w">Palestinian Authority</a>. The deal was &#34;brokered&#34; by the <a href="/wiki/American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee" id="w">American Israel Public Affairs Committee</a>.

<a id="Charity_work" name="Charity_work"></a><h2>Charity work</h2>
<p>In 2003 Majority Leader DeLay set up a charity for abused and neglected children, with part of the funds going to the 2004 GOP convention. The New York Times described it as &#34;aides to Mr. DeLay... acknowledged that part of the money would go to pay for late-night convention parties, a luxury suite during President Bush&#39;s speech at Madison Square Garden and yacht cruises. ... &#34;They are using the idea of helping children as a blatant cover for financing activities in connection with a convention with huge unlimited, undisclosed, unregulated contributions,&#34; said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a Washington group that helped push through the recent overhaul of the campaign finance laws.&#34;</p>

<a id="The_K_Street_Project" name="The_K_Street_Project"></a><h2>The K Street Project</h2>

DeLay&#39;s involvement with the lobbying industry included a pointed effort on the part of the Republican Party to parlay the Congressional majority into dominance of <a href="/wiki/K_Street" id="w">K Street</a>, the lobbying district of Washington, D.C. DeLay, Senator <a href="/wiki/Rick_Santorum" id="w">Rick Santorum</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Grover_Norquist" id="w">Grover Norquist</a> launched a campaign in 1995 encouraging lobbying firms to retain Republican officials in top positions.

<p>In 1999, DeLay was privately reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee after he pulled an important intellectual property rights bill off of the House floor when the Electronics Industries Alliance hired a former Democratic Congressman, <a href="/wiki/Dave_McCurdy" id="w">Dave McCurdy</a>.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

DeLay called the removal of the feeding tube &#34;an act of barbarism.&#34; DeLay faced accusations of hypocrisy from critics when the <i><a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" id="w">Los Angeles Times</a></i> revealed that he had consented to ending <a href="/wiki/Life_support" id="w">life support</a> for his father, who had been in a <a href="/wiki/Coma" id="w">comatose</a> state because of a debilitating accident in 1988.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>

<p>DeLay may be one of the targets of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice" id="w">Justice Department</a> investigation into Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff&#39;s actions. Abramoff allegedly provided DeLay with trips, gifts, and political donations in exchange for favors to Abramoff&#39;s lobbying clients, which included the government of the U.S. Commonwealth of the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Mariana_Islands" id="w">Northern Mariana Islands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Internet_gambling" id="w">Internet gambling</a> services, and several Native American tribes.<sup id="_ref-underscrutiny_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-underscrutiny" title="">[47]</a></sup> Two of DeLay&#39;s former political aides, <a href="/wiki/Tony_Rudy" id="w">Tony Rudy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Michael_Scanlon" id="w">Michael Scanlon</a>, as well as Abramoff himself, pled guilty in 2006 to charges relating to the investigation. Political columnist <a href="/wiki/Robert_Novak" id="w">Robert Novak</a> has since reported that Abramoff &#34;has no derogatory information about former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and is not implicating him as part of his plea bargain with federal prosecutors.&#34;<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" id="w">ABC</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/20/20" id="w">20/20</a></i> television program, Abramoff lobbied DeLay to stop legislation banning <a href="/wiki/Sex_shop" id="w">sex shops</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sweatshop" id="w">sweatshops</a> that forced employees to have abortions in the Northern Mariana Islands when Abramoff accompanied DeLay on a 1997 trip to the U.S. commonwealth. While on the trip, DeLay promised not to put the bill on the legislative calendar.<sup id="_ref-islandgetaway_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-islandgetaway" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2000, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a worker reform bill to extend the protection of U.S. labor and <a href="/wiki/Minimum_wage" id="w">minimum-wage</a> laws to the workers in the Northern Mariana Islands. DeLay, then the House Republican Whip, stopped the House from considering the bill.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> DeLay later blocked a fact-finding mission planned by Rep. <a href="/wiki/Peter_Hoekstra" id="w">Peter Hoekstra</a> by threatening Hoekstra with the loss of his subcommittee chairmanship.<sup id="_ref-islandgetaway_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-islandgetaway" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>

In May 2000, ARMPAC received the free use of one of Abramoff&#39;s private skyboxes to host a political fundraiser.

<p>Later that month, the DeLays, Rudy, another aide, and Abramoff took a trip to <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> and Scotland.

On the day that the trip began, The National Center received large donations from two of Abramoff&#39;s clients, internet lottery service eLottery, Inc., and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. Both organizations denied that they had intended to pay for DeLay&#39;s trip.<sup id="_ref-gamblinginterests_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamblinginterests" title="">[53]</a></sup> House rules forbid members to accept travel expenses from lobbyists, and require that members inquire into the sources of funds that nonprofits use to pay for trips. DeLay denied knowing that lobbyists had paid for travel expenses. In July 2000, DeLay voted against a bill that would have restricted internet gambling. Both eLottery and the Choctaws opposed the bill.<sup id="_ref-gamblinginterests_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamblinginterests" title="">[53]</a></sup> Rudy, who was then DeLay&#39;s deputy chief of staff, doomed the bill by engineering a parliamentary maneuver that required a two-thirds majority vote, rather than a simple majority, in order for the bill to pass. Rudy&#39;s actions on behalf of Abramoff&#39;s clients during this time were mentioned in Abramoff&#39;s guilty plea in January 2006.<sup id="_ref-Rudyinvestigation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rudyinvestigation" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>

<p>Abramoff referred clients to Ed Buckham&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Strategy_Group" id="w">Alexander Strategy Group</a> (ASG), a lobbying firm.

<p>From 1998 to 2002, ASG paid Christine DeLay a monthly salary averaging between $3,200.00 and $3,400.00 DeLay&#39;s attorney, Richard Cullen, initially said the payments were for telephone calls she made periodically to the offices of certain members of Congress seeking the names of their favorite charities, and that she then forwarded that information to Buckham, along with some information about those charities. But in early June 2006, Cullen said the payments were also for general political consulting she provided to her husband. In all, Christine DeLay was paid about $115,000 directly by ASG, and got another $25,000 via money put into a retirement account by the firm.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> Her work with ASG has been the subject of an inquiry by the Department of Justice.<sup id="_ref-underscrutiny_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-underscrutiny" title="">[47]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
