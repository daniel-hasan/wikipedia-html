<b>Dianetics</b> is a set of ideas and practices regarding the relationship between the spirit, mind and body that were developed by author <a href="/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard" id="w">L. Ron Hubbard</a>.  According to Hubbard, mental and psychosomatic physical problems are caused by traumatic recordings called <a href="/wiki/Engram_(Dianetics)" id="w">engrams</a> that are stored in the <a href="/wiki/Reactive_mind" id="w">reactive mind</a>. The goal of Dianetics is to erase the engrams in the reactive mind to achieve the state of Clear. Once this state of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Clear_(Scientology)" id="w">Clear</a>,&#34; is achieved according to Hubbard, an individual is able to function at his or her fully carnal, libidinous, and rigid potential.</p>
<p>Dianetics is still employed and disseminated by the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Scientology" id="w">Church of Scientology</a>, as reaching the state of &#34;Clear&#34; is a requirement to access Scientology&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Operating_Thetan" id="w">upper levels</a>.</p>
<a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a><h2> Overview </h2>
<p>Hubbard first introduced Dianetics to the public in April 1950, in an article published in the May 1950 issue of the magazine <i><a href="/wiki/Astounding_Science_Fiction" id="w">Astounding Science Fiction</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Creation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Creation" title="">[1]</a></sup>  In his subsequent book <i><a href="/wiki/Dianetics:_The_Modern_Science_of_Mental_Health" id="w">Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health</a></i> (1950), Hubbard presented Dianetics as a revolutionary and scientifically developed alternative to conventional <a href="/wiki/Psychotherapy" id="w">psychotherapy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Psychiatry" id="w">psychiatry</a>, that can increase intelligence, eliminate unwanted emotions and alleviate a wide range of illnesses he believed to be <a href="/wiki/Psychosomatic" id="w">psychosomatic</a>. The central practice of Dianetics is &#34;<a href="/wiki/Audit" id="w">auditing</a>,&#34; in which an evaluation of a person, organization, system, process, project or product is made to ascertain the validity and reliability of information, and also provide an assessment of a system&#39;s internal control (with the assistance of a counselor called an &#34;accountant&#34;).  As a result, a wide variety of resultant conditions are said to be treated.  </p>
<p>Scientology churches and missions provide workshops and seminars in Dianetics auditing, to help people new to the subject learn the rudiments of Dianetics techniques and to team people up with others who want to give and receive auditing, or double check their tax returns, simply using the techniques described in the Dianetics book.  Other more advanced applications of Dianetics auditing employ a device called an <a href="/wiki/E-meter" id="w">E-meter</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Though Dianetics preceded Hubbard&#39;s classification of <a href="/wiki/Scientology" id="w">Scientology</a> as &#34;applied religious philosophy,&#34; he believed from the beginning that the person himself is a spiritual being, and as early as 1951 in the Dianetics text called <a href="/wiki/Science_of_Survival" id="w">Science of Survival</a> he began to focus on the capabilities of &#34;the <a href="/wiki/Theta" id="w">theta</a> body or, as it might otherwise be called, the individual <a href="/wiki/Soul" id="w">soul</a>.&#34; <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> It is also practiced (sometimes with alteration of Hubbard&#39;s teaching) by independent groups, collectively called the <a href="/wiki/Free_Zone_(Scientology)" id="w">Free Zone</a>. The Church disapproves of Free Zone activities and has prosecuted them in court for misappropriation of Scientology/Dianetics copyrights and trademarks.<a href="/wiki/Http://www.xenu.net/archive/CourtFiles/" id="w">http://www.xenu.net/archive/CourtFiles/</a></p>
<p>Dianetics has been highly controversial since its introduction.  The scientific community has never recognized Hubbard&#39;s &#34;Modern Science of Mental Health&#34; as a valid <a href="/wiki/Scientific_theory" id="w">scientific theory</a>, and it has repeatedly been dismissed in print as <a href="/wiki/Pseudoscience" id="w">pseudoscience</a>. <a href="/wiki/Martin_Gardner" id="w">Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science</a> by Martin Gardner includes an entire chapter on the subject as cluedoscience.</p>
<a id="Basic_concepts" name="Basic_concepts"></a><h2>Basic concepts</h2>

<p>Hubbard coined <i>Dianetics</i> from the <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> stems <i>dia</i>, meaning through, and <i>nous</i>, meaning <a href="/wiki/Mind" id="w">mind</a>, resulting in a word similar to the already-existing Greek adjective <i>dianoētik-os</i> διανοητικ-ός, meaning &#34;mental&#34; (compare <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" id="w">Aristotle</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Dianoetic_virtues" id="w">dianoetic virtues</a>).  Hubbard stated that Dianetics &#34;forms a bridge between&#34; <a href="/wiki/Cybernetics" id="w">cybernetics</a> and <a href="/wiki/General_Semantics" id="w">General Semantics</a>, a set of ideas about education originated by <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski" id="w">Alfred Korzybski</a> that was receiving much attention in the science fiction world in the 1940s. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hubbard described Dianetics as &#34;an organized science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of <a href="/wiki/Natural_law" id="w">natural laws</a> on the order of those of the physical sciences, glaven mheyhey&#34;. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> These Dianetic axioms can be found in many Hubbard books such as <i><a href="/wiki/Scientology_0-8:_The_Book_of_Basics" id="w">Scientology 0-8: The Book of Basics</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Advanced_Procedures_and_Axioms" id="w">Advanced Procedures and Axioms</a></i>. Unlike conventional therapies, Hubbard said, Dianetics would work every time if applied properly and &#34;will invariably cure all psychosomatic ills and human aberrations.&#34; In April 1950, before the public release of Dianetics, he wrote: &#34;To date, over two hundred patients have been treated; of those two hundred, two hundred cures have been obtained.&#34;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In Dianetics, the unconscious or reactive mind is described as a collection of &#34;mental image pictures,&#34; which contain the recorded experience of past moments of unawareness, including all sensory perceptions and feelings involved, ranging from <a href="/wiki/Pre-natal" id="w">pre-natal</a> experiences, infancy and childhood, even the traumatic feelings associated events from past lives and alien cultures. The type of mental image picture created during a period of <a href="/wiki/Unconsciousness" id="w">unconsciousness</a> involves the exact recording of a painful experience. Hubbard called this phenomenon an <a href="/wiki/Engram_(Dianetics)" id="w">engram</a>, and defined it as &#34;a complete recording of a moment of unconsciousness containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions.&#34;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hubbard proposed that, via pain, physical or mental traumas caused &#34;aberrations&#34; (deviations from rational thinking) in the mind, which produced adverse physical and emotional effects. The conscious or analytical mind, out of a desire for survival, would instinctively shut down during moments of stress. The memories recorded during this period would be stored as engrams in the unconscious or reactive mind.  (In Hubbard&#39;s earliest publications on the subject, engrams were variously referred to as &#34;Norns&#34; <sup id="_ref-Creation_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Creation" title="">[1]</a></sup>, &#34;Impediments,&#34; and &#34;comanomes&#34;  before &#34;engram&#34; was adapted from its existing usage at the suggestion of <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Winter" id="w">Joseph Winter</a>.)<sup id="_ref-Blue Sky_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blue Sky" title="">[8]</a></sup> Some commentators noted Dianetics&#39; blend of science fiction and <a href="/wiki/Occult" id="w">occult</a> orientations at the time.<sup id="_ref-Creation_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Creation" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dianetics claims that these engrams are the cause of almost all psychological and physical problems. In addition to containing the experience of physical pain, engrams can also include words or phrases overheard by the patient while he was unconscious. For instance, Winter cites the example of a patient with a persistent headache supposedly tracing the problem to a doctor saying &#34;Take him now&#34; during the preclear&#39;s birth. <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>  Hubbard similarly claims that the cause of <a href="/wiki/Leukemia" id="w">leukemia</a> is traceable to &#34;an engram containing the phrase &#39;It turns my blood to water.&#39;&#34; <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>  While it is sometimes claimed that the Church of Scientology no longer stands by Hubbard&#39;s claims that Dianetics can treat physical conditions, it still publishes them:  &#34;... when the knee injuries of the past are located and discharged, the <a href="/wiki/Arthritis" id="w">arthritis</a> ceases, no other injury takes its place and the person is finished with arthritis of the knee.&#34; <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> &#34;[The reactive mind] can give a man arthritis, <a href="/wiki/Bursitis" id="w">bursitis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Asthma" id="w">asthma</a>, <a href="/wiki/Allergy" id="w">allergies</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sinusitis" id="w">sinusitis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Corony_artery" id="w">coronary</a> trouble, high <a href="/wiki/Blood_pressure" id="w">blood pressure</a> ... And it is the only thing in the human being which can produce these effects ... Discharge the content of [the reactive mind] and the arthritis vanishes, <a href="/wiki/Myopia" id="w">myopia</a> gets better, heart illness decreases, asthma disappears, stomachs function properly and the whole catalog of ills goes away and stays away.&#34; <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some of the <a href="/wiki/Psychometrics" id="w">psychometric</a> ideas in Dianetics can be traced to <a href="/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" id="w">Sigmund Freud</a>, whom Hubbard credited as an inspiration and was said to have used as a source.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Freud had speculated 40 years previously that traumas with similar content join together in &#34;chains,&#34; embedded in the unconscious mind, to cause irrational responses in the individual. Such a chain would be relieved by inducing the patient to remember the earliest trauma, &#34;with an accompanying expression of emotion.&#34;<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the use of Dianetics techniques, Hubbard claimed, the reactive mind could be processed and all stored engrams could be refiled as experience. The central technique was &#34;auditing,&#34; a two-person <a href="/wiki/Talk_therapy" id="w">question-and-answer therapy</a> designed to isolate and dissipate engrams (or &#34;mental masses&#34;). An auditor addresses questions to a subject, observes and records the subject&#39;s responses, and returns repeatedly to experiences or areas under discussion that appear painful until the troubling experience has been identified and confronted. Through repeated applications of this method, the reactive mind could be &#34;cleared&#34; of its content having outlived its usefulness in the <a href="/wiki/Process" id="w">process</a> of <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">evolution</a>; a person who has completed this process would be &#34;Clear&#34;. </p>
<p>The benefits of going Clear, according to Hubbard, were dramatic. A Clear would have no compulsions, repressions, <a href="/wiki/Psychosis" id="w">psychoses</a> or <a href="/wiki/Neurosis" id="w">neuroses</a>, and would enjoy a near-perfect memory as well as a rise in <a href="/wiki/IQ" id="w">IQ</a> of as much as 50 points. He also claimed that &#34;the atheist is activated by engrams as thoroughly as the zealot&#34;. <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> He further believed that widespread application of Dianetics would result in &#34;A world without <a href="/wiki/Insanity" id="w">insanity</a>, without criminals and without war,&#34; <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> </p>
<p>According to the Scientology journal <i>The Auditor</i>, the total number of &#34;Clears&#34; as of <a href="/wiki/May_2006" id="w">May 2006</a> stands at 50,311.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> One critical organization&#39;s analysis, however, brings the accuracy of the official figures into question.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Scientific_evaluation_and_criticisms" name="Scientific_evaluation_and_criticisms"></a><h2>Scientific evaluation and criticisms</h2>
<p>{{Quotation}}
Hubbard&#39;s original book on Dianetics attracted highly critical reviews from science and medical writers and organizations. The <a href="/wiki/American_Psychological_Association" id="w">American Psychological Association</a> passed a resolution in 1950 calling &#34;attention to the fact that these claims are not supported by <a href="/wiki/Empiricism" id="w">empirical</a> evidence of the sort required for the establishment of scientific generalizations.&#34;<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Subsequently, Dianetics has achieved no general acceptance as a <i><a href="/wiki/Bona_fide" id="w">bona fide</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Scientific_theory" id="w">scientific theory</a>. <sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup>  Many scientists have described Dianetics as a classic example of <a href="/wiki/Pseudoscience" id="w">pseudoscience</a>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Few scientific investigations into the effectiveness of Dianetics have been published. Professor John A. Lee states in his 1970 evaluation of Dianetics:</p>
<dl><dd>Objective experimental verification of Hubbard&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Physiology" id="w">physiological</a> and psychological doctrines is lacking. To date, no regular scientific agency has established the validity of his theories of prenatal perception and engrams, or cellular memory, or Dianetic reverie, or the effects of Scientology auditing routines. Existing knowledge contradicts Hubbard&#39;s theory of recording of perceptions during periods of unconsciousness. <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/MEDLINE" id="w">MEDLINE</a> database records two independent scientific studies on Dianetics, both conducted in the 1950s under the auspices of <a href="/wiki/New_York_University" id="w">New York University</a>. Harvey Jay Fischer tested Dianetics therapy against three claims made by proponents and found it does not effect any significant changes in intellectual functioning, mathematical ability, or the degree of personality conflicts;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Jack Fox tested Hubbard&#39;s thesis regarding recall of engrams, with the assistance of the Dianetic Research Foundation, and could not substantiate it.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hubbard claimed, in an interview with the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" id="w">New York Times</a></i> in November 1950, that &#34;he had already submitted proof of claims made in the book to a number of scientists and associations. He added that the public as well as proper organizations were entitled to such proof and that he was ready and willing to give such proof in detail.&#34;<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> In January 1951, the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation of <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth%2C_NJ" id="w">Elizabeth, NJ</a> published <i>Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results</i>, a booklet providing the results of psychometric tests conducted on 88 people undergoing Dianetics therapy. It presents case histories and a number of <a href="/wiki/X-ray" id="w">X-ray</a> plates to support claims that Dianetics had cured &#34;aberrations&#34; including <a href="/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" id="w">manic depression</a>, asthma, <a href="/wiki/Arthritis" id="w">arthritis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colitis" id="w">colitis</a> and &#34;overt homosexuality,&#34; and that after Dianetic processing, test subjects experienced significantly increased scores on a standardized IQ test. The report&#39;s subjects are not identified by name, but one of them is clearly Hubbard himself (&#34;Case 1080A, R. L.&#34;).<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>The authors provide no qualifications, although they are described in Hubbard&#39;s book <i>Science of Survival</i> (where some results of the same study were reprinted) as psychotherapists. Critics of Dianetics are skeptical of this study, both because of the bias of the source and because the researchers appear to ascribe all physical benefits to Dianetics without considering possible outside factors; in other words, the report lacks any <a href="/wiki/Scientific_control" id="w">scientific controls</a>.  J.A. Winter, M.D., originally an associate of Hubbard and an early adopter of Dianetics, wrote an account of his personal positive experiences with Dianetics, but criticized the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for failing to undertake &#34;precise scientific research into the functioning of the mind&#34;.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Commentators from a variety of backgrounds have described Dianetics as an example of pseudoscience, that is, information which claims to be scientific but which fails to meet the basic criteria for science.  For example, <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" id="w">philosophy</a> professor <a href="/wiki/Robert_Carroll" id="w">Robert Carroll</a> points to Dianetics&#39; lack of empirical evidence:</p>
<dl><dd>What Hubbard touts as a science of mind lacks one key element that is expected of a science: empirical testing of claims. The key elements of Hubbard&#39;s so-called science don&#39;t seem testable, yet he repeatedly claims that he is asserting only scientific facts and data from many experiments. It isn&#39;t even clear what such &#34;data&#34; would look like. Most of his data is in the form of anecdotes and speculations ... Such speculation is appropriate in fiction, but not in science.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><a href="/wiki/W._Sumner_Davis" id="w">W. Sumner Davis</a> similarly comments that </p>
<dl><dd>Dianetics is nothing more than an example of pseudoscience trying to legitimize itself ... Hubbard, had he indeed been a scientist, would have known that truth is not built on axioms, and facts cannot be found from some a-priori knowledge. A true science is constructed on <a href="/wiki/Hypothesis" id="w">hypotheses</a>, which are arrived at by the virtue of observed phenomena. Scientific knowledge is gained by observation and testing, not believing from some <a href="/wiki/Subconscious" id="w">subconscious</a> stipulation, as Hubbard would have us believe.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>In the years since its introduction, Dianetics has become a sub-study of the spiritually focused &#34;applied religious philosophy&#34; of Scientology, and the Church of Scientology places little emphasis on Hubbard&#39;s original claims to have created a &#34;modern science.&#34;  Current practitioners of Dianetics typically believe that charges of pseudoscience are irrelevant, emphasizing that their own experience of the therapy&#39;s &#34;workability&#34; is far more important to them than the imprimatur of official science.</p>
<a id="Procedure_in_practice" name="Procedure_in_practice"></a><h2>Procedure in practice</h2>

<p>The procedure of Dianetics therapy – known as <i>auditing</i>, from the <a href="/wiki/Latin_language" id="w">Latin</a> <i>audire</i>, &#34;to listen&#34; – is a two-person activity. One person, the &#34;auditor&#34;, guides the other person, the &#34;preclear&#34;. The preclear&#39;s job is to look at the mind and talk to the auditor. The auditor acknowledges what the preclear says and controls the process so the preclear may put his full attention on his work.</p>
<p>The auditor and preclear sit down in chairs facing each other. The process then follows in eleven distinct steps: <sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<dl><dd>1. The auditor assures the preclear that he will be fully aware of everything that happens during the session.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>2. The preclear is instructed to close his eyes for the session, entering a state of &#34;dianetic reverie&#34;, signified by &#34;a tremble of the lashes&#34;. During the session, the preclear remains in full possession of his will and retains full recall thereafter.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>3. The auditor installs a &#34;canceller&#34;, an instruction intended to absolutely cancel any form of positive suggestion that could accidentally occur. This is done by saying &#34;In the future, when I utter the word &#39;cancelled,&#39; everything I have said to you while you are in a therapy session will be cancelled and will have no force with you. Any suggestion I may have made to you will be without force when I say the word &#39;cancelled.&#39; Do you understand?&#34;</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>4. The auditor then asks the preclear to locate an exact record of something that happened to the preclear in his past: &#34;Locate an incident that you feel you can comfortably face.&#34;</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>5. The preclear is invited by the auditor to &#34;Go through the incident and say what is happening as you go along.&#34;</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>6a. The auditor instructs the preclear to recall as much as possible of the incident, going over it several times &#34;until the preclear is cheerful about it&#34;.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>6b. When the preclear is cheerful about an incident, the auditor instructs the preclear to locate another incident: &#34;Let&#39;s find another incident that you feel you can comfortably face.&#34; The process outlined at steps 5 and 6a then repeats until the auditing session&#39;s time limit (usually two hours or so) is reached.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>7. The preclear is instructed to &#34;return to present time&#34;.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>8. The auditor checks to make sure that the preclear feels himself to be in &#34;present time&#34;, i.e. not still recalling a past incident.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>9. The auditor gives the preclear the canceller word: &#34;Very good. Cancelled.&#34;</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>10. The auditor tells the preclear to feel alert and return to full awareness of his surroundings: &#34;When I count from five to one and snap my fingers you will feel alert. Five, four, three, two, one.&#34; (Snap!)</dd></dl>
<p>Auditing sessions are kept confidential. However, a few transcripts of auditing sessions with <a href="/wiki/Sanitization_(classified_information)" id="w">confidential information removed</a> have been published as demonstration examples. Some extracts can be found in Dr. J.A. Winter&#39;s book <i>Dianetics: A Doctor&#39;s Report</i>. Other, more comprehensive, transcripts of auditing sessions carried out by Hubbard himself can be found in volume 1 of the <i>Research &#38; Discovery Series</i> (Bridge Publications, 1980). Examples of public group processing sessions can be found throughout the Congress Lecture series.</p>
<p>According to Hubbard, auditing enables the preclear to &#34;contact&#34; and &#34;release&#34; engrams stored in the reactive mind, relieving him of the physical and mental aberrations connected with them. The preclear is asked to inspect and familiarize himself with the exact details of his own experience; the auditor may not tell him anything about his case or evaluate any of the information the preclear finds.</p>
<p>The validity and practice of auditing have been questioned by a variety of non-Scientologist commentators. Commenting on the example cited by Winter, the science writer <a href="/wiki/Martin_Gardner" id="w">Martin Gardner</a> asserts that &#34;nothing could be clearer from the above dialogue than the fact that the dianetic explanation for the headache existed only in the mind of the therapist, and that it was with considerable difficulty that the patient was maneuvered into accepting it.&#34; <sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Other critics and medical experts have suggested that Dianetic auditing is a form of <a href="/wiki/Hypnosis" id="w">hypnosis</a><sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup>  <sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup>, although the Church of Scientology has strongly denied that hypnosis forms any part of Dianetics. <sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> Critics also point out that subjects in a hypnotic state, even a light one, are more susceptible to suggestion. Winter [1950] comments that the leading nature of the questions asked of a preclear &#34;encourage fantasy&#34;, a common issue also encountered with hypnosis, which can be used to form <a href="/wiki/False_memory#discussion" id="w">false memories</a>. The auditor is instructed not to make any assessment of a recalled memory&#39;s reality or accuracy, but instead to treat it as if it were objectively real. Professor Richard J. Ofshe, a leading expert on false memories, suggests that the feeling of well-being reported by preclears at the end of an auditing session may be induced by post-hypnotic <a href="/wiki/Suggestion" id="w">suggestion</a>. <sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Autocontrol" name="Autocontrol"></a><h2> Autocontrol </h2>
<p>According to Hubbard, since the beginning of Dianetics research back in 1930, the majority of the people interested in the subject believed in vain they could accomplish therapy alone. &#34;It cannot be done&#34; and he adds: &#34;If a patient places himself in autohypnosis and regresses himself in an effort to reach illness or birth or prenatals, the only thing he will get is ill&#34;. <sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>{{main}}
Hubbard&#39;s ideas of Dianetics originated in the 1920s and 1930s. By his own account, he spent a great deal of time in the <a href="/wiki/Naval_Hospital_Oakland" id="w">Oak Knoll Naval Hospital&#39;s</a> library, where he would have encountered the work of Freud and other <a href="/wiki/Psychoanalysis" id="w">psychoanalysts</a>. In April 1950, Hubbard and several others established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Elizabeth, New Jersey</a> to coordinate work related for the forthcoming publication. Hubbard wrote <i>Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health</i> at that time, allegedly completing the 180,000-word book in six weeks.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>The success of selling <i><a href="/wiki/Dianetics:_The_Modern_Science_of_Mental_Health" id="w">Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health</a></i> brought in a flood of money, which Hubbard used to establish Dianetics foundations in six major American cities. The scientific and medical communities were far less enthusiastic about Dianetics, viewing it with bemusement, concern, or outright derision. Complaints were made against local Dianetics practitioners for allegedly practicing medicine without a license. This eventually prompted Dianetics advocates to disclaim any medicinal benefits in order to avoid regulation.</p>
<p>Hubbard explained the backlash as a response from various entities trying to co-opt Dianetics for their own use. Hubbard blamed the hostile press coverage in particular on a plot by the <a href="/wiki/American_Communist_Party" id="w">American Communist Party</a>. In later years, Hubbard decided that the psychiatric profession was the origin of all of the criticism of Dianetics, as he believed it secretly controlled most of the world&#39;s governments.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the autumn of 1950, financial problems had developed, and by November 1950, the six Foundations had spent around one million dollars and were more than $200,000 in debt.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Disagreements emerged over the direction of the Dianetic Foundation&#39;s work, and relations between the board members became strained, with several leaving, even to support causes critical of Dianetics. One example was <a href="/wiki/Harvey_Jackins" id="w">Harvey Jackins</a>, founder of <a href="/wiki/Re-evaluation_Counseling" id="w">Re-evaluation Counselling</a>, originally a sort of discrete reworking of Dianetics, which L Ron Hubbard later declared suppressive to Scientology.</p>
<p>In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners instituted proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth for teaching medicine without a licence.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> The Foundation closed its doors, causing the proceedings to be vacated, but its creditors began to demand settlement of its outstanding debts. Don Purcell, a millionaire Dianeticist from <a href="/wiki/Wichita%2C_Kansas" id="w">Wichita, Kansas</a>, offered a brief respite from bankruptcy, but the Foundation&#39;s finances failed again in 1952.<sup id="_ref-barefaced_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-barefaced" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because of a sale of assets resulting from the bankruptcy, Hubbard no longer owned the rights to the name &#34;Dianetics&#34;<sup id="_ref-barefaced_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-barefaced" title="">[42]</a></sup>, but its philosophical framework still provided the seed for <a href="/wiki/Scientology" id="w">Scientology</a> to grow. Scientologists refer to the book <i>Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health</i> as &#34;Book One&#34;. In 1952, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as &#34;Scientology, a <a href="/wiki/Religious_philosophy" id="w">religious philosophy</a>&#34;. Scientology did not replace Dianetics but extended it to cover new areas. Where the goal of Dianetics is to rid the individual of his reactive mind engrams, the stated goal of Scientology is to rehabilitate the individual&#39;s spiritual nature so that he may reach his full potential. </p>
<p>In 1978, Hubbard released <i>New Era Dianetics</i>, a revised version supposed to produce better results in a shorter period of time. The course consists of 11 <a href="/wiki/Rundown_(Scientology)" id="w">rundowns</a> and requires a specifically trained auditor.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
