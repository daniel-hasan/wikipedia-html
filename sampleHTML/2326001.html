<p>In September 1998, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Wilson" id="w">Michael Wilson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barbara_Broccoli" id="w">Barbara Broccoli</a>, owners of <a href="/wiki/EON_Productions" id="w">EON Productions</a> and producers of the <a href="/wiki/James_Bond_(films)" id="w">James Bond movie franchise</a>, selected David Arnold as the composer for the upcoming nineteenth Bond movie, due for release the following year. During November and December 1998, Arnold and Black met several times and exchanged phone calls, faxes and e-mails to discuss the lyrics for &#34;The World Is Not Enough&#34;. According to Arnold, he &#34;strung some la-la’s together, and all of a sudden the [song] came to life, and [he] thought [that was] probably it.&#34; By the end of the year, the songwriters had completed both the song and lyrics, save for the <a href="/wiki/Bridge_(music)" id="w">bridge</a>, a brief section in the middle of the song.<sup id="_ref-findlaw_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-findlaw" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Production_team" id="w">production team</a> of the film were keen for the song to be written as early as possible, with a view to using elements of the melody within the main score of the film. The director, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Apted" id="w">Michael Apted</a>, spoke about his involvement with the theme tune on his <i>The World Is Not Enough</i> DVD commentary: &#34;I made it clear to [Arnold] the sort of tone I needed for the song. We wanted something romantic and haunting. I was insistent that we got a rough draft of the song out soon enough so that it could be incorporated into the score. I remembered how effective that was in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Spy_Who_Loved_Me_(film)" id="w">The Spy Who Loved Me</a></i>; they were able to use the song, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Nobody_Does_It_Better" id="w">Nobody Does It Better</a>&#34;, as a love theme throughout the film.&#34;<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Arnold compared creating a Bond theme tune to &#34;a poisoned chalice,  because it can sound too much or not enough like a James Bond song&#34;.<sup id="_ref-comment2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-comment2" title="">[15]</a></sup> He mentioned that orchestra was needed along with electronic sounds because the music would be a staple of the Bond series - &#34;If James Bond abandoned his <a href="/wiki/Black_tie" id="w">dinner jacket</a>, <a href="/wiki/Womanizer" id="w">womanising</a>, or <a href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_gadgets" id="w">gadget-using</a> you&#39;d feel cheated. The music is a safety net for the audience, without it you haven&#39;t got a James Bond movie, you&#39;ve got an action movie.&#34; <sup id="_ref-cocktail_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cocktail" title="">[16]</a></sup> He also expressed the need of a &#34;classic Bond sound&#34; but then felt as if it belonged to the rest of the score.<sup id="_ref-comment2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-comment2" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the beginning of January 1999, Arnold had completed the basic outline for the song and created a <a href="/wiki/Demo_(music)" id="w">demo</a> recording of it at his private recording studio. He played the track to Wilson, Broccoli and Apted, who said that they were &#34;extremely pleased&#34; with the song. However, MGM initially disliked the song because it was a <a href="/wiki/Ballad_(music)" id="w">ballad</a> and had hoped for a theme song with a different <a href="/wiki/Tempo" id="w">tempo</a>. The company contacted Arnold in March 1999 and claimed that a &#34;three-note <a href="/wiki/Motif_(music)" id="w">motif</a>&#34; in &#34;The World Is Not Enough&#34; was too similar to a motif in a number of earlier Bond theme songs. Arnold agreed to remove the <a href="/wiki/Sequence_(music)" id="w">sequence</a>.<sup id="_ref-findlaw_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-findlaw" title="">[13]</a></sup> Drummer <a href="/wiki/Butch_Vig" id="w">Butch Vig</a> told Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, &#34;David sent us a rough demo with just the synthesizer playing the string mockup and after Don entered some lyrics. And we really loved it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-kiss_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiss" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>{{q}}</p>
<p>Arnold initially met with Garbage vocalist Shirley Manson in London in January 1999,<sup id="_ref-findlaw_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-findlaw" title="">[13]</a></sup> and called her up a week later and formally offered Garbage the opportunity to perform the next Bond single. <sup id="_ref-jam_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jam" title="">[18]</a></sup> Arnold sent the band &#34;The World Is Not Enough&#34; demo to them on the morning of their sold-out show at London&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Wembley_Arena" id="w">Wembley Arena</a> on <a href="/wiki/January_20" id="w">January 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a>.</p>
<p>To quell legal issues regarding Manson&#39;s label status (she remains signed to UMG&#39;s Radioactive Records under a 1993 six-album <a href="/wiki/Record_deal" id="w">record deal</a>, while in 1999, the band was signed to <a href="/wiki/Independent_record_label" id="w">independent record labels</a> <a href="/wiki/A%26amp%3BE_Records" id="w">Mushroom Records UK</a> and <a href="/wiki/Almo_Sounds" id="w">Almo Sounds</a>), the song was licensed to Radioactive Records. Arnold was pleased at Garbage&#39;s reaction to being asked to do the theme: &#34;I actually haven&#39;t heard anyone scream down the phone before. Never come across a more enthusiastic response to a &#39;do-you-wanna-do-this?&#39; question.&#34;<sup id="_ref-cocktail_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cocktail" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Garbage was on a European concert tour and could not find spare time to record and produce the song. A concert in <a href="/wiki/Lisbon" id="w">Lisbon</a> on <a href="/wiki/July_18" id="w">July 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a> was rescheduled to end earlier so that the band would have time to jet to Metropolis Studios in London, UK to record their composition with Arnold&#39;s 60-piece orchestra, and then fly to <a href="/wiki/Six-Fours-les-Plages" id="w">Six-Fours-les-Plages</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> the following day to resume their touring commitments. Re-writes and production took place through phone calls and e-mails, but most of the song was recorded over a week in August 1999 at Armoury Studios in Vancouver. Manson requested a lyrical change in the song because the line <i>&#34;I know when to kiss and I know when to kill&#34;</i> did not meet her tastes. Arnold and Black accordingly changed the lyrics to the <a href="/wiki/First_person_plural" id="w">first-person plural</a> which appears in the final version. Thus, the song concluded with the lyric &#34;We know when to kiss and we know when to kill.&#34;<sup id="_ref-findlaw_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-findlaw" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Vig recalled to MKKBB  &#34;It was a lot different for us because for one thing it was the first time we were working with a 60-piece orchestra and we wanted to make sure we had after hearing the song that we had the right <a href="/wiki/Key_(music)" id="w">key</a>, right tempo. It was difficult - we were on tour so we sort of went back and forth with David on the telephone. We&#39;d be in a hotel room in <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> playing stuff… We&#39;d set up a portable studio and then play stuff over the phone and he&#39;d play things back to us. You know, very crude but it worked enough for us to bang out the arrangement cause we had to fly to London to record the basic tracks, but we wanted to have the strings done so Shirley could sing to the string track. That primarily carries a lot of the song.&#34; He also stated, &#34;David did the strings in a day and we just flew in for one day and cut the basic tracks - throw in some bass, some guitar and vocals. The tour continued in Europe for about another three and a half weeks. Then we flew up to Vancouver where we took the track and &#39;Garbage-ized&#39; it. We were basically cutting and pasting things and adding and subtracting and recorded and mixed it there.&#34;<sup id="_ref-kiss_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiss" title="">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>{{q}}</p>
<p>Shirley Manson told the documentary makers, whilst in the recording studio in August 1999 that composing a James Bond song had always been Garbage&#39;s dream. She said, &#34;The sensibility is quite similar to how we approach making music. I jumped at the chance [to record the theme] because I think it&#39;s an institution I admire and has always captured my imagination since I was a child. The entire time I felt unworthy, but to sing with a full orchestra is exhilarating!&#34;<sup id="_ref-cocktail_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cocktail" title="">[16]</a></sup> Manson also told Kerrang! magazine in September 1999 that &#34;one of the biggest attractions in doing a Bond song is that you know it&#39;s going down in movie history.&#34;<sup id="_ref-kerrang_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kerrang" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Vig told <a href="/wiki/CNN" id="w">CNN</a> &#34;We were trying to make sure the arrangement was good, because the song has a very dynamic and sweeping melody line. We&#39;re pretty pleased with how it turned out. To Garbage fans, it sounds like a Garbage song. And to Bond fans, it&#39;s a Bond song.&#34;<sup id="_ref-cnn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cnn" title="">[20]</a></sup> He told MKKBB &#34;The orchestra took up so much space and really dictated where the song was going <a href="/wiki/Dynamics_(music)" id="w">dynamically</a>. The dynamics are incredible with this piece, so it really kept our recording a lot simpler. Besides the drums and bass and some <a href="/wiki/Percussion" id="w">percussive</a> <a href="/wiki/Music_loop" id="w">loops</a>, there&#39;s a little bit of guitar that Duke and Steve did. But there&#39;s not a lot of miscellaneous tracks on there. There&#39;s a few little ear candy things that we did, but it&#39;s all meant to work around Shirley&#39;s singing.&#34;<sup id="_ref-kiss_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiss" title="">[17]</a></sup> Guitarist <a href="/wiki/Steve_Marker" id="w">Steve Marker</a> added to Kerrang!: &#34;The music has always played such a big part in Bond movies. It was a challenge for us not to screw it up too badly!&#34;<sup id="_ref-kerrang_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kerrang" title="">[19]</a></sup> Arnold considered the song &#34;a combination of strong theatrical material, with strong lyrics and  the perfect band for the movie&#34;, with an &#34; easy recording process.&#34; He was quoted saying that &#34;everyone was on the same page, we got it done really quickly&#34;. <sup id="_ref-comment2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-comment2" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Garbage did not attend the premiere of the film, instead attending a local showing in <a href="/wiki/Tucson%2C_Arizona" id="w">Tucson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arizona" id="w">Arizona</a> during a break from the concert tour. &#34;We were on tour so we couldn&#39;t make it&#34;, Vig told CNN, &#34;But we saw the movie in Tucson with a regular audience during its opening weekend. By the time we left the theater, there were like 500 kids standing outside and asking for autographs, so we had our own little mini-premiere.&#34;<sup id="_ref-cnn_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cnn" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>The song&#39;s promotional video features a plot set in 1964 which involves scientists cloning singer Shirley Manson on an unnamed Pacific island. The clone is an <a href="/wiki/Android" id="w">android</a> replica of Manson whom, in true Bond style, has the ability to kill her enemies with a single kiss. She has also been fitted with an explosive device that is set prior to leaving on her mission. The android Manson makes her way through the storyline; killing one male <a href="/wiki/Research_subject" id="w">research subject</a> with her fatal kiss, then driving to the fictional <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_Illinois" id="w">Chicago</a> New Globe Theater and killing the real Shirley Manson with another kiss. The android then impersonates the real Manson on stage with Garbage whilst her bomb is ticking down to zero.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> Manson plays both the android and herself in the video, and in one scene kisses a look-alike model acting as her double.<sup id="_ref-makingthevideo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthevideo" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>The video was produced by Oil Factory Films, directed by Philipp Stölzl and shot in Black Island Studios, London on a two-day shooting schedule taking place on <a href="/wiki/September_23" id="w">September 23</a> and <a href="/wiki/September_24" id="w">September 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a>. Most of the android scenes were filmed first (laboratory scene, both kissing scenes and driving scene); the rest of the band joined Manson for the stage, globe and <a href="/wiki/Pyrotechnic" id="w">pyrotechnic</a> scenes on the second day.<sup id="_ref-makingthevideo_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthevideo" title="">[22]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Post-production" id="w">Post-production</a> and <a href="/wiki/Editing" id="w">editing</a> was completed over the following two weeks.<sup id="_ref-mtvema_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mtvema" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>The concept of Manson playing a clone of herself was brought by director Stölzl.<sup id="_ref-makingthevideo_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthevideo" title="">[22]</a></sup> Vig described the shoot as &#34;much more of a pain in the ass than recording the song. It was like making a mini Bond film.&#34;<sup id="_ref-cnn_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cnn" title="">[20]</a></sup> John Pennicott, whose company supplied the android shooting model, told <a href="/wiki/MTV" id="w">MTV</a> &#34;The inspiration for the look of the android [was taken from] Philipp&#39;s drawings and his <a href="/wiki/Storyboard" id="w">storyboard</a>. We used <a href="/wiki/Aircraft" id="w">aircraft</a> parts, bits from <a href="/wiki/Guided_missiles" id="w">guided missiles</a>, bits of tubing, metal and plastic. We can put them together and emulate his drawings. The elements within the android are used in post-production to combine with Shirley so that she looks as though she has a mechanical inside.&#34;<sup id="_ref-makingthevideo_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthevideo" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Vig spoke to MKKBB &#34;He drew up a <a href="/wiki/Film_treatment" id="w">treatment</a> that we really liked and for whatever reason, because [they were] paying for it, MGM and EON felt that it was not &#39;Bond&#39; enough. We went back and forth with that cause we were also trying to make a Garbage video. Then Philip came back with a second treatment that was amazing. It reminds me of that <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" id="w">Hitchcock</a> film (<i><a href="/wiki/The_Man_Who_Knew_Too_Much_(1956_film)" id="w">The Man Who Knew Too Much</a></i>). Some of the shots look like <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick" id="w">Stanley Kubrick</a>. Visually it&#39;s a really cool looking, amazing looking video&#34; and also &#34;For us it was just important that the music video was a Garbage video. It&#39;s already the song from the film and the whole elements of it are very sort of Bond-esque with the whole lyrics structure. And there are these sort of nods in it that are maybe sort of <a href="/wiki/Homage" id="w">homages</a> to the classic bond <a href="/wiki/Screenplay" id="w">structure and scenario</a>!&#34;<sup id="_ref-kiss_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiss" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Manson told <i><a href="/wiki/Melody_Maker" id="w">Melody Maker</a></i> &#34;Our video is like a mini-Bond action-packed film, where an android removes evil from the world and sacrifices herself in the process like a <a href="/wiki/Kamikaze" id="w">kamikaze</a> warrior. That&#39;s as close as we&#39;ll ever get [to being in a Bond movie].&#34; Vig added, &#34;We just love the idea that Shirley is a bomb. That there&#39;s this evil Shirley and a good Shirley and you don&#39;t know exactly who. I think you figure it out by the end. It&#39;s very <a href="/wiki/Camp_(style)" id="w">campy</a> too. There&#39;s always a bit of that camp factor in some of the Bond films. We thought there were certainly a lot of very Bond-esque moments in the video that we thought worked really well, and we&#39;re pleased with how it turned out.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MM_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MM" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

<p>Two edits of the video exist, one of which contains footage from the film. The standard edit of the video can be found on all releases issued by Garbage&#39;s record label, and was shown by most networks globally. The edit that includes footage from the movie was mostly broadcast on U.S. music channels. It is included as a &#39;special feature&#39; DVD extra on the worldwide 2002 &#34;The World Is Not Enough&#34;  <a href="/wiki/Special_edition" id="w">DVD Special Edition</a> release and the 2006 re-packaged &#34;Ultimate Edition&#34; release.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>

The mix downplays the Bond sound in favour of a more easily recognisable Garbage style.
