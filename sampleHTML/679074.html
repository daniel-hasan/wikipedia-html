<p><b><i>Quatermass and the Pit</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> television <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television" id="w">science-fiction</a> <a href="/wiki/Serial_(radio_and_television)" id="w">serial</a>, originally transmitted by <a href="/wiki/BBC_One" id="w">BBC Television</a> in December and January 1958&#8211;59. It was the third and last of the BBC&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Bernard_Quatermass" id="w">Quatermass</a></i> serials, although the character would reappear in a 1979 <a href="/wiki/ITV" id="w">ITV</a> production simply entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Quatermass_(TV_serial)" id="w">Quatermass</a></i>. Like its predecessors, <i>Quatermass and the Pit</i> was written by <a href="/wiki/Nigel_Kneale" id="w">Nigel Kneale</a>.</p>
<p>The series continues the loose chronology of the Quatermass adventures, and begins with <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Quatermass" id="w">Professor Bernard Quatermass</a> being forced out of his role at the British Experimental Rocket Group, with the organisation being passed into military control by the <a href="/wiki/Her_Majesty%26%2339%3Bs_Government" id="w">British Government</a>. Quatermass and his new colleague Colonel Breen become involved in the discovery of a bizarre object at an <a href="/wiki/Archeology" id="w">archaeological</a> dig in <a href="/wiki/Knightsbridge" id="w">Knightsbridge</a>, <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>. As the serial progresses, Quatermass and his associates find that the contents of the object have a horrific influence over many of those who come into contact with it. As this influence increases, affecting Quatermass himself, darker implications are revealed about the entire nature and origins of <a href="/wiki/Mankind" id="w">mankind</a>.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption"><a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Morell" id="w">André Morell</a> as <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Quatermass" id="w">Professor Bernard Quatermass</a>, in a scene from the fourth episode.</div></div>

A pre-human <a href="/wiki/Skull" id="w">skull</a> is discovered while building works are taking place in the fictional Hobbs Lane &#8212; formerly Hob&#39;s Lane, from an old name for the <a href="/wiki/Devil" id="w">Devil</a>. Dr Matthew Roney, a <a href="/wiki/Paleontology" id="w">palaeontologist</a>, examines the recovered remains, which are many thousands of years old, and reconstructs a <a href="/wiki/Dwarf" id="w">dwarf</a>-like <a href="/wiki/Humanoid" id="w">humanoid</a> with an unusually large <a href="/wiki/Brain" id="w">brain</a> volume, which he believes to be a form of primitive man. As further excavation is done on the site, something that looks like a <a href="/wiki/Missile" id="w">missile</a> is unearthed; further work by Roney&#39;s group is halted as the military believe it to be an unexploded bomb left over from <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>Roney calls in his old friend Professor <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Quatermass" id="w">Bernard Quatermass</a> of the British Experimental Rocket Group, an expert on matters of unusual scientific background, to stop the military from disturbing what he believes to be an archaeological find. Quatermass and Colonel Breen, who has been placed in charge of the Rocket Group over Quatermass&#39;s objections, become intrigued by the site. More and more of the artefact is uncovered, and additional <a href="/wiki/Fossil" id="w">fossils</a> are found inside which Roney dates to five million years in age &#8212; suggesting that the object is at least that old as well. The interior is empty, but a symbol consisting of five intersecting circles, which Roney identifies as the occult <a href="/wiki/Pentagram" id="w">pentagram</a>, is found etched on an interior wall which appears to hide an inner chamber.</p>
<p>The shell of the object is so hard that even a <a href="/wiki/Borozon" id="w">borozon</a> drill makes no impression, and when the attempt is made, strange vibrations cause severe distress in the people around the object. Quatermass interviews the local residents and discovers that sightings of <a href="/wiki/Ghost" id="w">ghosts</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Poltergeist" id="w">poltergeist</a> activity have been common in the area for decades. Meanwhile, a soldier is carried out of the object in hysterics &#8212; he claims to have seen a dwarf-like apparition walk through the wall of the artefact, a description which matches a 1927 <a href="/wiki/Newspaper" id="w">newspaper</a> account of a ghost sighting.</p>
<p>Following the drilling attempt, a hole has somehow opened up in the wall which allows Quatermass and the others access to the interior chamber. There they find the remains of <a href="/wiki/Insect" id="w">insect</a>-like <a href="/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" id="w">aliens</a> resembling giant three-legged <a href="/wiki/Locust" id="w">locusts</a>, with stubby antennae on their heads giving the impression of horns. As Quatermass and Roney examine the remains, they theorise that the aliens might have come from a nearby <a href="/wiki/Planet" id="w">planet</a> which was habitable five million years ago &#8212; <a href="/wiki/Mars_(planet)" id="w">Mars</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the borozon drill operator clearing his equipment from the craft triggers off more poltergeist activity. The operator is forced to run through the streets in a dazed panic until he finds sanctuary inside a local <a href="/wiki/Church" id="w">church</a>. Quatermass and Roney find him there, and he describes visions of the insect aliens killing each other. As Quatermass investigates deeper into the history of the area, he finds accounts dating back to <a href="/wiki/Medieval" id="w">medieval</a> times about devils and ghosts, all tending to be centred on incidents where the ground was disturbed. He suspects that somehow a psychic projection of these beings has remained behind on the alien ship and is being seen by certain people who come in contact with it.</p>
<p>Quatermass plans to use an invention of Roney&#39;s, an &#34;optic-encephalogram&#34;, to see these visions. The device will record impressions from the optical centres of the brain, in effect showing whatever the subject is seeing, <a href="/wiki/Hallucination" id="w">hallucinatory</a> or not. He wears the device and goes into the craft, but it is Roney&#39;s assistant, Barbara Judd, who is affected most. Placing the device on her, they record what she &#34;sees&#34; &#8212; a violent, bloody purge of the Martian <a href="/wiki/Hive" id="w">hive</a>, to root out unwanted mutations.</p>
<p>Quatermass begins to have a working theory as to what is going on. He believes that in its most primitive phase mankind was visited by this race. Some humans were taken away and genetically altered to have special abilities such as <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" id="w">telepathy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Telekinesis" id="w">telekinesis</a> and other psychic powers. They were then brought back to Earth &#8212; the buried artefact was one of the return ships that had crashed. The idea was that, with their home world dying, the aliens had tried to change humanity&#39;s ancestors to have minds and abilities like theirs, created in their own mental image, but with a bodily form adapted to Earth. In effect, humanity are the Martians.</p>
<p>However, the plan was a partial failure: the aliens died out before completing their work, and as the human race bred and further evolved, only a percentage of it retained these abilities, with even these only surfacing sporadically. For centuries the buried ship itself had been occasionally triggering these dormant abilities. This explained the reports of poltergeists, people were unknowingly using their own telekinesis to move objects around them, the ghost sightings being traces of a race memory. It also explained the history of witchcraft and why people attributed it to a being they identified as the devil; the pentagram would have been the symbol for this alien race.</p>
<p>The government authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara&#39;s vision. They believe that the craft is actually a <a href="/wiki/Nazism" id="w">Nazi</a> <a href="/wiki/Propaganda" id="w">propaganda</a> weapon and the alien bodies fakes designed to create exactly the impressions that Quatermass has come to. They attribute the vision to an overactive imagination, and intend to hold a media event to halt the rumours that are already flitting through the population. However, Quatermass realises that if these implanted psychic powers survive in the human race, there could also still be ingrained in us a compulsion to enact the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Wild_Hunt" id="w">Wild Hunt</a>&#34; of a race purge. Quatermass is concerned that the memories encoded inside the ship, which have already been picked up by sensitive people near it, will trigger that impulse and that those affected will begin to slaughter their own.</p>
<p>Despite his warnings, the media event occurs, and the power cables that string into the craft fully activate it for the first time. Glowing and humming like a living thing, it starts drawing upon this energy source and awakening the ancient racial programming. Those people of London in whom the alien admixture remains strong fall under the ship&#39;s influence; they merge into a <a href="/wiki/Group_mind_(science_fiction)" id="w">group mind</a> and begin a telekinetic <a href="/wiki/Mass_murder" id="w">mass murder</a> of those without the alien <a href="/wiki/Genetics" id="w">genes</a>, an &#34;<a href="/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing" id="w">ethnic cleansing</a>&#34; of those that the alien race mind considers impure and weak.</p>
<p>Breen stands transfixed and is eventually consumed by the energies from the craft as it slowly melts away and a <a href="/wiki/Hologram" id="w">holographic</a> image of a Martian &#34;devil&#34; floats in the sky above London. Fires and riots spread, and even a passing <a href="/wiki/Aircraft" id="w">aircraft</a> is affected and crashes into the city. Quatermass himself almost succumbs to the mass <a href="/wiki/Psychosis" id="w">psychosis</a>, attempting to kill Roney, who does not have the alien gene and is immune to the influence. Roney manages to shake Quatermass out of his trance, and together they realise that the floating image is the source of the mass psychosis. Even without the craft and electricity, it is now draining the combined psychic energy of London.</p>
<p>Remembering the legends of demons and their aversion to <a href="/wiki/Iron" id="w">iron</a> and water, Roney deduces that a sufficient mass of iron connected to wet earth may be enough to <a href="/wiki/Short_circuit" id="w">short</a> the apparition out. Quatermass gets a length of iron <a href="/wiki/Link_chain" id="w">chain</a> and tries to reach the &#34;devil&#34; but succumbs to the psychic pressure. It is Roney who manages to hurl the chain into the fiery image and end the madness, but both he and the craft are reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Some time later Quatermass holds a <a href="/wiki/Television" id="w">television</a> broadcast, in which he praises Roney&#39;s sacrifice, saying that they now are armed with knowledge that will allow them to deal with any more Martian artefacts. He also warns that now that we are aware of the dark urges implanted within us all, we have to be careful about wars, witch-hunts and other communal violence &#8212; lest we Martians turn the Earth into a second dead planet.</p>

<p><i>The Times<b>s television reviewer praised the opening episode the day after its transmission. Pointing out that &#34;Professor Bernard Quatermass... like all science fiction heroes, has to keep running hard if he is not to be overtaken by the world of fact,&#34;<sup id="_ref-ep1review_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep1review" title="">[46]</a></sup> the anonymous reviewer went on to state how much he had enjoyed the episode. </b></i></p>
<p /><blockquote>&#34;This expository episode was an excellent example of Mr. Kneale&#39;s ability to hold an audience with promises alone; smooth, leisurely, and without any sensational incident, it was imbued in Mr. Rudolph Cartier&#39;s production with unearthly echoes of horrors to come. Sharing them for the next six weeks with Mr. Andre Morell and Mr. Cec Linder is an unnerving prospect.&#34;<sup id="_ref-ep1review_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep1review" title="">[46]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Criticism of the serial was also expressed. Although Kneale would go on to use the Martian &#34;Wild Hunt&#34; as a deliberate allegory for the recent Notting Hill race riots,<sup id="_ref-timesobit_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timesobit" title="">[47]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-intimate_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-intimate" title="">[48]</a></sup> some <a href="/wiki/Black_British" id="w">Black British</a> leaders were upset with the depiction of racial tensions in the first episode. &#34;Leaders of coloured minorities here to-day criticized the BBC for allowing a report that &#39;race riots are continuing in <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" id="w">Birmingham</a>,&#39; to be included in a fictional news bulletin during the first instalment of the new Quatermass television play last night,&#34; reported <i>The Times<b>s Birmingham correspondent.<sup id="_ref-birmingham_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-birmingham" title="">[49]</a></sup> The report quoted Dr. W. C. Pilgrim of the city&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" id="w">West Indian</a> community as saying that &#34;I do not agree with this sort of thing, fiction or not. No trouble of this kind has happened in Birmingham, where our problems do not find expression in violence.&#34;<sup id="_ref-birmingham_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-birmingham" title="">[49]</a></sup> The BBC replied to the criticisms with the assurance that:</b></i></p>
<p /><blockquote>&#34;This was a completely imaginary news bulletin in a fictional programme set in the indeterminate future that contained such items as a rocket landing on the moon. It was all <a href="/wiki/Jules_Verne" id="w">Jules Verne</a> sort of stuff. No slur on Birmingham was implied and no reference to past events nor prophecy of the future was intended.&#34;<sup id="_ref-birmingham_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-birmingham" title="">[49]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>These themes and subtexts were highlighted by the <a href="/wiki/British_Film_Institute" id="w">British Film Institute</a>&#39;s review of the serial, when it was included in their &#34;TV 100&#34; list in 2000, in 75th position &#8212; 20th out of the dramas featured.<sup id="_ref-bfi100_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bfi100" title="">[3]</a></sup> &#34;In a story which mined mythology and folklore... under the guise of genre it tackled serious themes of man&#39;s hostile nature and the military&#39;s perversion of science for its own ends.&#34;<sup id="_ref-bfi100_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bfi100" title="">[3]</a></sup> The theme of military takeover of peaceful scientific research was also praised and compared to the contemporary outlook by Patrick Stoddart, writing for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sunday_Times_(UK)" id="w">The Sunday Times</a></i> in 1988.</p><blockquote>&#34;Last week I watched a BBC drama in which a scientist fought against smirking government ministers and power-crazed army officers to stop his peaceful rocket research group being turned into a <a href="/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative" id="w">Star Wars</a> vehicle to put missiles on the moon. They won. If you are wondering how you missed the ritual complaints which now follow every programme like this from offstage right, it is because the play was <i>Quatermass and the Pit</i>, which the BBC has just released on video. It was made in 1957, when the <a href="/wiki/Harold_Macmillan" id="w">Macmillan</a> government presumably believed that defence policy was a reasonable thing for the BBC to debate, even in drama. You seriously wonder how much internal angst would be generated if the BBC was offered the same plot now.&#34;<sup id="_ref-starwars_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-starwars" title="">[50]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>The serial has also been an influence on other television science-fiction productions. <a href="/wiki/Mark_Gatiss" id="w">Mark Gatiss</a> wrote in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" id="w">The Guardian</a></i> in 2006 that &#34;What sci-fi piece of the past 50 years doesn&#39;t owe Kneale a huge debt? ...

So I said that this was the solution: that what we had to do with <i>Doctor Who</i> was to forget wobbly jellies in outer space and create some reason for bringing the stories down to Earth.&#34;<sup id="_ref-sixties_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sixties" title="">[54]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>More specifically, the 1977 <i>Doctor Who</i> serial <i><a href="/wiki/Image_of_the_Fendahl" id="w">Image of the Fendahl</a></i> contains many very similar elements and themes to <i>Quatermass and the Pit</i>.<sup id="_ref-fendahl_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fendahl" title="">[55]</a></sup> After the destruction of its homeworld, the Fendahl of the title came to Earth and influenced the evolution of humans to possess psychic powers.
