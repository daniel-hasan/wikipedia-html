<p>The <b>BEST</b> (<a href="/wiki/Marathi_language" id="w">Marathi</a>: बृहन्मुंबई विद्युतपुरवठा आणि परिवहन उपक्रम / <b>बेस्ट</b>) or the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport is <a href="/wiki/Mumbai" id="w">Mumbai</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Public_transport" id="w">public transport</a> service and <a href="/wiki/Electricity" id="w">electricity</a> provider. The government-owned <a href="/wiki/Organisation" id="w">organisation</a>, which was set up in 1873, operates one of <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>&#39;s largest fleets of buses. Originally setup as a <a href="/wiki/Tram" id="w">tramway</a> company, it branched out into supplying electricity to the city in 1905, and later into operating buses in 1926. The BEST is run by the <a href="/wiki/Municipal_Corporation_of_Greater_Mumbai" id="w">city&#39;s municipality</a> as an autonomous body.</p>
<p>The bus transport service covers the entire city and also extends its operations outside city limits into neighbouring <a href="/wiki/Navi_Mumbai" id="w">Navi Mumbai</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thane" id="w">Thane</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mira_Road" id="w">Mira</a>-<a href="/wiki/Bhayandar" id="w">Bhayandar</a>. In addition to buses, it also operates a ferry service in the northern reaches of the city. The electricity division of the organisation is also one of the few electricity departments in India to garner an annual net profit. </p>
<p>Until 1995, <i>BEST</i> stood for Bombay Electricity Supply and Transport. After the name of the city was formally changed from Bombay to Mumbai, this was also reflected with the adjustment to <i>Brihanmumbai</i>, which means &#34;Greater Mumbai&#34;.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<a id="Origins" name="Origins"></a><h2>Origins</h2>
<p>The idea of a mass public transport system for Mumbai was first put forward in 1865 by an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> company, which applied for a licence to operate a horse-drawn tramway system. Although a licence was granted, the project was never realised, owing to the prevailing economic depression in the city. The end of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>, during which Bombay had made vast strides in its economy by supplying cotton and textiles to the world market, was the reason for the economic downturn.</p>
<p>Later, on <a href="/wiki/1871-11-27" id="w">1871-11-27</a>, a notice in the <i><a href="/wiki/Times_of_India" id="w">Times of India</a></i> newspaper put by the Bombay Omnibus Service, proposed to set up a bus service between <a href="/wiki/Malabar_Hill" id="w">Malabar Hill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fort_(area)" id="w">Fort</a>. However, the proposed monthly pass fare of thirty <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" id="w">pounds</a> proved to be too expensive, and the tender was promptly abandoned.<sup id="_ref-Tram Car_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tram Car" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

The birth of the BEST dates back to 1873, with the setting up of the Bombay Tramway Company Limited, which was given the licence to operate <a href="/wiki/Trams" id="w">trams</a> in the city. The <a href="/wiki/Bombay_Municipal_Corporation" id="w">Bombay Municipal Corporation</a> (BMC) was given the right to purchase the company after twenty-five years, or after seven years thereafter. In 1874, the <i>Bombay Tramways Act</i> was enacted after the contract was formally signed between the Municipality and the Company to start such a transport system. </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/9_May" id="w">9 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1874" id="w">1874</a>, the first horse-drawn carriage made its début in the city, plying on the <a href="/wiki/Colaba" id="w">Colaba</a>&#8211;<a href="/wiki/Pydhone" id="w">Pydhone</a> via <a href="/wiki/Crawford_Market" id="w">Crawford Market</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bori_Bunder" id="w">Bori Bunder</a> to <a href="/wiki/Pydhonie" id="w">Pydhonie</a> via <a href="/wiki/Kalbadevi" id="w">Kalbadevi</a> routes. The initial fare was three <a href="/wiki/Indian_anna" id="w">annas</a> (15 <a href="/wiki/Paisa" id="w">paise</a>), and no tickets were issued. As the service became increasingly popular, the fare was reduced to two annas (10&#160;paise). Later that year, tickets were issued for the first time, to curb the increasing ticketless travel.</p>

In 1899, the company applied to the BMC, for operation of electrically operated trams. Due to the high investment required, the company suggested that the BMC should waive its right to take over the tramways, which was to take place in 1901 according to the contract signed in 1874. However, the BMC decided to take over the company anyway. The takeover created several legal problems, which lead to the foundation of a new public company, the <a href="/wiki/Bombay_Electric_Supply_%26amp%3B_Tramways_Company_Limited" id="w">Bombay Electric Supply &#38; Tramways Company Limited</a>, which bought out the Bombay Tramway Company in 1905.<sup id="_ref-Tram Car_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tram Car" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>That same year, the company also acquired the <a href="/wiki/British_Electric_Traction_Company" id="w">British Electric Traction Company</a>, which owned a 1,100&#160;<a href="/wiki/Horsepower" id="w">hp</a> (820&#160;<a href="/wiki/Kilowatt" id="w">kw</a>) generator and serviced 107 consumers. Two years later, the first electric tram debuted in the city. Later that year, a 4,300&#160;kw <a href="/wiki/Steam_power" id="w">steam power</a> generator was commissioned at Wari Bunder. In 1916, power purchase from the <a href="/wiki/Tata_Power" id="w">Tata Power</a> group, a privately owned company, was started and by 1925, all power generation was outsourced from Tata.<sup id="_ref-Electricity_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Electricity" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

Since 1913, the company had been pondering over starting a motorised bus service. The main factor against its introduction was the high accident rate for a similar service in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>. Finally, after years of debate, the company came to a decision on <a href="/wiki/10_February" id="w">10 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1926" id="w">1926</a>, to start a bus service later that year. On <a href="/wiki/15_July" id="w">15 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1926" id="w">1926</a>, the first bus service in India was started on three routes. Despite stiff opposition and protests by taxi-drivers, the service ran without a hitch, transporting six <a href="/wiki/Lakh" id="w">lakh</a> (600,000) passengers by the end of that year. The following year the number had increased to 38&#160;<a href="/wiki/Lakhs" id="w">lakhs</a> (3.8&#160;million). The trams meanwhile, due to their lower fares, were relegated to being a poor man&#39;s transport.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Indian_independence_movement" id="w">Indian independence movement</a>&#39;s call for mass non-violent strikes and general <a href="/wiki/Civil_disobedience" id="w">civil disobedience</a>, led to regular service disruptions, leading to the company incurring huge losses in 1929. The next year was a particular bad year for the company in the wake of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">Great Depression</a>. To remain solvent, the company decided to introduce discounted fares for short routes, and increase its coverage to the northern portions of the city. In 1937, the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Double-decker_bus" id="w">double-decker buses</a> proved to be extremely popular.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> brought with it the rationing of fuel and a shortage of tires. The increasing costs of owing a car forced many to switch to using the bus service. Despite huge losses, the company diligently <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ply">plied</a> its buses and trams to cater to the residents of Bombay.<sup id="_ref-Motor Bus_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Motor Bus" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

After <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Independence_of_India" id="w">India&#39;s independence</a>, the management of the company was taken over by the BMC in <a href="/wiki/7_August" id="w">7 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1947" id="w">1947</a>, and the company was renamed &#39;The BEST Undertaking&#39;.<sup id="_ref-BES&T_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BES&T" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the company grew post-independence, it increased its fleet from 242 to 582 buses over the next decade. In 1949, it took over the <a href="/wiki/Bandra_Bus_Company" id="w">Bandra Bus Company</a>, which used to ply buses in the <a href="/wiki/Mumbai_suburban_district" id="w">suburbs</a>.<sup id="_ref-Progress_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Progress" title="">[5]</a></sup> In 1951, the electricity division switched over from <a href="/wiki/Direct_current" id="w">direct current</a> (DC) to the more efficient <a href="/wiki/Alternating_current" id="w">alternating current</a> (AC). The company launched its services in the eastern suburbs in 1955. That year, the Undertaking and private operators went to court, with the BEST asking for a complete closure of the private companies. The case dragged on for four years before the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India" id="w">Supreme Court of India</a> granted the organisation a complete <a href="/wiki/Monopoly" id="w">monopoly</a> over bus services in the <a href="/wiki/Greater_Bombay" id="w">Greater Bombay</a> area.

<p>The company achieved the status of being the first company in the country to issue computerised billing in 1974. In 1994, the company introduced electronic meters, in a move to replace the less accurate electric meters.

<p>For the financial year 2005–06, BEST is expected to earn Rs.&#160;1,540.13&#160;crore ($352.92m) with a profit of 140.8&#160;crore ($32.3m) from the electricity department alone. However, its transport department is expected to earn 948.68&#160;crore ($217.39m), with a loss of 140.30&#160;crore ($32.26m). This gives it an estimated net loss of Rs.&#160;50&#160;lakhs ($114,575).<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Finance_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Finance" title="">[20]</a></sup> Newer management techniques, such as retrenching of excess staff (494 till date),<sup id="_ref-ET_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ET" title="">[17]</a></sup> and the closure of less patronised routes, have reduced the losses in recent years, from a high of Rs. 175 crore ($40.1m) in 2001.<sup id="_ref-Best Man_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best Man" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

Daily earnings from its transport system is Rs.&#160;2&#160;crore ($458,450). It collects Rs.&#160;70&#160;lakh ($160,450) worth of five rupee coins daily, Rs.&#160;48&#160;lakh ($110,000) worth of ten and twenty rupee notes, and Rs.&#160;60&#160;lakh ($137,535) worth of fifty rupee notes, through its fare collection system. This has led a unique situation wherein it has accumulated a surplus of short change. In July 2005, the company floated tender inquiries to 54 banks to exchange the loose change, which totalled 4.67&#160;crore ($1.07m). However, none of the banks sent in a single bid, some citing that their vaults are full, and others saying it would be unprofitable for low denominations, given security considerations.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though the BEST is a government-owned company, it does not receive any financial assistance from the BMC, or the state government.<sup id="_ref-ET_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ET" title="">[17]</a></sup> BEST also earns revenues by way of advertisements on its buses and bus-stops, and through rent from offices on owned properties. The BEST, being a public utility company, cannot increase electricity and bus fares to maximise its profits. An increase, when effected, is usually carried out to curb losses due to inflation. BMC approval is needed before such an increase goes into effect.</p>

BEST has been a quintessential part of life in Mumbai. The red double decker buses, modelled on the <a href="/wiki/Routemaster" id="w">Routemaster</a> buses of London, are one of the defining characteristics of the city. When BEST decided to do away with the double-deckers for operational reasons recently, public protests and sentiment forced it to continue with the service. A move to colour all its buses saffron from red in 1997 also drew in sharp criticism, resulting in the red colour being retained. Bus drivers and conductors have come in for praise in the media for their service during the <a href="/wiki/2005_Mumbai_floods" id="w">2005 Mumbai floods</a>, when they ensured that all the stranded passengers were dropped safely to their respective destinations. A total of 900 buses were rendered useless due to the deluge.</p>
