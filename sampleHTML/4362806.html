<p>{{Windows Vista}}
<b>Development of <a href="/wiki/Windows_Vista" id="w">Windows Vista</a></b> occurred over the span of five and a half years, starting in earnest in May 2001,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> prior to the release of <a href="/wiki/Microsoft" id="w">Microsoft</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Windows_XP" id="w">Windows XP</a> operating system, and continuing until November 2006.</p>
<p>Microsoft originally expected to ship the new version sometime late in 2003 as a minor step between Windows XP and &#34;Blackcomb&#34;.{{fact}} Vista&#39;s original <a href="/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_software_codenames" id="w">codename</a>, &#34;Longhorn&#34;, was an allusion to this plan: While Whistler and Blackcomb are large ski resorts in <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a>, Longhorn is the name of a bar between the two mountains that Whistler&#39;s visitors pass to reach Blackcomb. Gradually, &#34;Longhorn&#34; assimilated many of the important new features and technologies slated for &#34;Blackcomb&#34;, resulting in the release date being pushed back a few times. Many of Microsoft&#39;s developers were also re-tasked with improving the security of Windows XP. Faced with ongoing delays and concerns about <a href="/wiki/Creeping_featurism" id="w">feature creep</a>, Microsoft announced on <a href="/wiki/August_27" id="w">August 27</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a> that it was making significant changes. &#34;Longhorn&#34; development basically started afresh, building on the <a href="/wiki/Windows_Server_2003" id="w">Windows Server 2003</a> codebase, and re-incorporating only the features that would be intended for an actual operating system release. Some previously announced features, such as <a href="/wiki/WinFS" id="w">WinFS</a> and <a href="/wiki/Next-Generation_Secure_Computing_Base" id="w">NGSCB</a>, were dropped or postponed.</p>
<p>After &#34;Longhorn&#34; was named Windows Vista in mid-2005, an unprecedented <a href="/wiki/Development_stage" id="w">beta-test</a> program was started which involved hundreds of thousands of volunteers and companies. Between September 2005 and October 2006, Microsoft released regular <a href="/wiki/CTP" id="w">Community Technology Previews</a> (CTP) to beta testers, and two release candidates to the general public. Development of Windows Vista came to a conclusion with the <a href="/wiki/November_8" id="w">November 8</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> announcement of its completion by co-president of Windows development, <a href="/wiki/Jim_Allchin" id="w">Jim Allchin</a>.</p>
<a id="2002:_Early_development" name="2002:_Early_development"></a><h1>2002: Early development</h1>
<p>The early development stages of Longhorn were generally characterized by incremental improvements and updates to Windows XP. During this period, Microsoft was fairly quiet about what was being worked on, as their marketing and public relations focus was more strongly focused on Windows XP, and <a href="/wiki/Windows_Server_2003" id="w">Windows Server 2003</a>, which was released in April of 2003. Occasional builds of Longhorn were leaked onto popular <a href="/wiki/File_sharing" id="w">file sharing</a> networks such as <a href="/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" id="w">IRC</a>, <a href="/wiki/BitTorrent" id="w">BitTorrent</a>, <a href="/wiki/EDonkey_network" id="w">eDonkey</a> and various <a href="/wiki/Newsgroup" id="w">newsgroups</a>, and so most of what is known about builds prior to the first sanctioned development release of Longhorn in May 2003, is derived from these builds.</p>
<p>Most builds of Longhorn and Vista were identified by a label that was always displayed in the bottom-right corner of the desktop. A typical build label would look like &#34;Build 3683.Lab06_N.020923-1821&#34;. Higher build numbers didn&#39;t automatically mean that the latest features from every development team at Microsoft was included. Typically, a team working on a certain feature or subsystem would generate their own working builds which developers would test with, and when the code was deemed stable, all the changes would be incorporated back into the main development tree at once. At Microsoft, a number of &#34;Build labs&#34; exist where the compilation of the entirety of Windows can be performed by a team. The lab in which any given build originated is shown as part of the build label, and the date and time of the build follows that. Some builds (such as Beta 1 and Beta 2) only display the build label in the version information dialog (Winver).</p>

<p><b>Build 3663</b> (build date of <a href="/wiki/July_28" id="w">July 28</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>) was the first known build with some leaked screenshots. It was the first sighting of the &#34;Plex&#34; style which Microsoft regarded as a place-holder theme for their development versions, until they were ready to demonstrate <a href="/wiki/Aero_(user_interface)" id="w">Aero</a>. Screenshots of <b>Build 3670</b> (build date of <a href="/wiki/August_19" id="w">August 19</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>) also showed a variation of the Device Manager implemented inside Windows Explorer.</p>

This build was the first of several that had a working title of &#34;<b>Longhorn XP Professional</b>&#34;. Visually it was not significantly different from Windows XP, incorporating aesthetic changes and a few new user interface options. A new &#34;Sidebar&#34; was also present, which contained many of the gadgets that would much later be seen in <a href="/wiki/Windows_Sidebar" id="w">Windows Sidebar</a>, such as an analog clock, slide show, and search capability. An option in this version of the sidebar also made it possible to move the Start button into it, and disable the traditional taskbar entirely. An early revision of <a href="/wiki/WinFS" id="w">WinFS</a> was also included, but very little in the way of a user interface was included, and as such it appeared to early testers to be nothing more than a service that consumed large amounts of memory and processor time. The &#34;Display Properties&#34; control panel<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> was the first significant departure, being built on the new &#34;<a href="/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation" id="w">Avalon</a>&#34; <a href="/wiki/Application_programming_interface" id="w">API</a>.<sup id="_ref-build3683_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-build3683" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">&#34;Windows XP Longhorn&#34;, Build 4008</div>
After several months of relatively little news or activity from Microsoft with Longhorn, <b>Build 4008</b> (with a build date of <a href="/wiki/February_19" id="w">February 19</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>) made an appearance on the Internet around <a href="/wiki/February_28" id="w">February 28</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>.<sup id="_ref-build4008_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-build4008" title="">[4]</a></sup> It was also privately handed out to a select group of software developers. As an evolutionary release over build 3683, it contained a number of small improvements, including a modified blue &#34;Plex&#34; theme and a new, simplified Windows Image-based installer that operates in graphical mode from the outset, and completed an install of the operating system in approximately one third the time of Windows XP on the same hardware. An optional &#34;new taskbar&#34; was introduced that was thinner than the previous build and displayed the time differently.</p>
<p>The most notable visual and functional difference, however, came with <a href="/wiki/Windows_Explorer" id="w">Windows Explorer</a>. The incorporation of the Plex theme made blue the dominant color of the entire application. The Windows XP-style task pane was almost completely replaced with a large horizontal pane that appeared under the toolbars. A new search interface allowed for filtering of results, searching of Windows help, and natural-language queries that would be used to integrate with WinFS. The animated search characters were also removed. The &#34;view modes&#34; were also replaced with a single slider that would resize the icons in real-time, in list, thumbnail, or details mode, depending on where the slider was. File metadata was also made more visible and more easily editable, with more active encouragement to fill out missing pieces of information. Also of note was the conversion of Windows Explorer to being a <a href="/wiki/.NET_Framework" id="w">.NET</a> application.</p>
<a id="Milestone_5" name="Milestone_5"></a><h2>Milestone 5</h2>
<p><b>Build 4015</b> (build date of <a href="/wiki/March_28" id="w">March 28</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>) was leaked to the Internet on <a href="/wiki/April_28" id="w">April 28</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>. A number of features Microsoft had been working on were rolled into this build, such as a range of parental controls, a lot of additional configurability for the sidebar (including being able to put it below the start bar at the bottom of the screen), and the notion of &#34;Libraries&#34; (later known as virtual folders) of files. These libraries collected content from around the hard drive. The user could then filter this content and save it in a folder. Microsoft had originally intended to replace all special shell folders (My Documents, My Music, etc.) with virtual folders. However, this change was deemed too drastic and was dropped after Beta 1&#39;s release in mid-2005. This build was also notable for the debut of the boot screen progress bar that is seen in the final release (though 4015&#39;s version was blue, not green). A new Download Manager shell location suggested that the OS (and Internet Explorer 7) would get a <a href="/wiki/Mozilla" id="w">Mozilla</a>-style download manager. This feature was also dropped. Significant <a href="/wiki/Memory_leak" id="w">memory leak</a> problems with Windows Explorer and the Sidebar made this build difficult to use, which resulted in some third-party hacks to mitigate the problem. The back-end database of Outlook Express changed completely, and became dependent on WinFS to store its email. WinFS itself still had significant performance and memory usage issues, and so it became common for testers to disable WinFS entirely, thus rendering Outlook Express inoperative.</p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/Windows_Hardware_Engineering_Conference" id="w">Windows Hardware Engineering Conference</a> (WinHEC) conference in May 2003, Microsoft gave their first public demonstrations of the new Desktop Window Manager and Aero. The demonstrations were done on a revised build 4015 which was never released. A number of sessions for developers and hardware engineers at the conference focused on these new features, as well as the <a href="/wiki/Next_Generation_Secure_Computing_Base" id="w">Next Generation Secure Computing Base</a> (previously known as &#34;Palladium&#34;), which at the time was Microsoft&#39;s proposed solution for creating a secure computing environment whereby any given component of the system could be deemed &#34;trusted&#34;. Also at this conference, Microsoft reiterated their roadmap for delivering Longhorn, pointing to an &#34;early 2005&#34; release date.<sup id="_ref-winhec2003_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-winhec2003" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

This build contained few of the technologies new to build 4015. Windows Explorer went through a number of other changes. Larger image and video previews were displayed in a tooltip when the mouse hovered over a file, column-level filtering of results was introduced, and overall performance of Explorer was somewhat improved over build 4015, though the memory leak issues were not entirely resolved. There was also a new analog clock user interface. Batch image processing of images was also introduced, making it possible for a user to rotate a number of images at once.</p>
<p>Build 4029&#39;s name was displayed as &#34;<b>onghornLay rofessionalPay</b>&#34; (<a href="/wiki/Pig_Latin" id="w">Pig Latin</a> for Longhorn Professional) in various places around the operating system. While some had presumed that screenshots of this build were fake because of this seemingly obvious mistake, Microsoft later explained that this was merely a test of some new code to locate and reduce the number of places in the operating system code that the name was defined.<sup id="_ref-build4029name_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-build4029name" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

The technology, better known by its original code-name of &#34;Palladium&#34;, had garnered much criticism from analysts, security specialists and researchers, and was often cited by advocates of non-<a href="/wiki/Microsoft" id="w">Microsoft</a> operating systems as a reason to migrate to their preferred platform. <a href="/wiki/Ross_Anderson" id="w">Ross Anderson</a>, for example, published a paper, collating many of these concerns and criticisms as part of a larger analysis on <a href="/wiki/Trusted_Computing" id="w">Trusted Computing</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> In light of a large amount of negative response not only from analysts, but enterprise customers and software developers, Microsoft shelved many aspects of the NGSCB project for an indefinite period of time.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The only aspect of NGSCB that was included with the final release of the operating system is &#34;<a href="/wiki/BitLocker_Drive_Encryption" id="w">BitLocker</a>&#34;, which can make use of a Trusted Platform Module chip to facilitate secure startup and full-drive encryption.</p>

<p>By the end of 2003, it had become obvious to the Windows team at Microsoft that they were losing sight of what needed to be done to complete the next version of Windows and ship it to customers. Internally, some Microsoft employees were describing the Longhorn project as &#34;another Cairo&#34; or &#34;Cairo.NET&#34;, referring to the <a href="/wiki/Cairo_(operating_system)" id="w">Cairo development project</a> that the company embarked on through the first half of the 1990s, which never resulted in a shipping operating system (though nearly all the technologies developed in that time did end up in <a href="/wiki/Windows_95" id="w">Windows 95</a> and <a href="/wiki/Windows_NT" id="w">Windows NT</a>.<sup id="_ref-caplancairo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-caplancairo" title="">[9]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>In a <a href="/wiki/September_23" id="w">September 23</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> front-page article on <a href="/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal" id="w">The Wall Street Journal</a>,<sup id="_ref-resetwsj_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-resetwsj" title="">[10]</a></sup> Microsoft co-president <a href="/wiki/James_Allchin" id="w">Jim Allchin</a>, who had overall responsibility for the development and delivery of Windows, explained how development of Longhorn was &#34;crashing into the ground&#34; due in large part to the haphazard methods by which features were introduced and integrated into the core of the operating system, without a clear focus on an end-product. In December 2003, Allchin enlisted the help of two other senior executives, Brian Valentine and Amitabh Srivastava, the former being experienced with shipping software at Microsoft, most notably Windows Server 2003,<sup id="_ref-supersitevalentine_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-supersitevalentine" title="">[11]</a></sup> and the latter having spent his career at Microsoft researching and developing methods of producing high-quality testing systems.<sup id="_ref-forbessrivastava_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-forbessrivastava" title="">[12]</a></sup> Srivastava employed a team of core architects to visually map out the entirety of the Windows operating system, and to proactively work towards a development process that would enforce high levels of code quality, reduce interdependencies between components, and in general, &#34;not make things worse with Vista&#34;.<sup id="_ref-channel9kernel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-channel9kernel" title="">[13]</a></sup> These things, in conjunction with the fact that many of Microsoft&#39;s most skilled developers and engineers had been working on Windows Server 2003, led to the decision to &#34;reset&#34; development of Longhorn, building on the same code that would become Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, instead of the older Windows XP. This change, announced internally to Microsoft employees on <a href="/wiki/August_26" id="w">August 26</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, began in earnest in September, though it would take several more months before the new development process and build methodology would be used by all of the development teams. A number of complaints came from individual developers, and Bill Gates himself, that the new development process was going to be prohibitively difficult to work within. Changes at the build labs also resulted in a period of time of several months where no builds of Longhorn were leaked onto the Internet.</p>

<p><b>Build 3790</b> (build date of <a href="/wiki/September_7" id="w">September 7</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>) is notable, as it was the first build of Longhorn based on the Server 2003 codebase, but with the Windows XP interface. Successive internal builds over several months gradually integrated a lot of the fundamental work that had been done over the previous three years, but with much stricter rules about what code could be brought into the main builds. Builds in this period of time were described variously as Longhorn &#34;D1&#34;, and as Milestone 8 / 9, depending on whether the new or old build tree was being worked on.

At the keynote presentation, Bill Gates also announced that many of the WinFX developer APIs that were originally planned exclusively for Longhorn were going to be backported to Windows XP and Server 2003, and that the final user interface for Longhorn would not be seen for a while longer. Other features such as device-independent resolutions, rasterized icons, virtual folders, and registry virtualization were discussed as well.</p>
<p>Build 5048&#39;s closer resemblance to Windows XP than to the prior Longhorn builds from 2003 surprised many, leading well-known Windows enthusiast <a href="/wiki/Paul_Thurrott" id="w">Paul Thurrott</a> to write: &#34;My thoughts are not positive, not positive at all. This is a painful build to have to deal with after a year of waiting, a step back in some ways. I hope Microsoft has surprises up their sleeves. This has the makings of a train wreck.&#34;<sup id="_ref-thurrott5048_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thurrott5048" title="">[15]</a></sup> Months later, Thurrott stated that the Vista development process has since recovered in the more recent builds.</p>

<p>By the beginning of <a href="/wiki/July" id="w">July</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, having painted itself into a corner, so to speak, by choosing names like Windows Me and XP for previous client releases of Windows, Microsoft now had to find an even more interesting name for &#34;Longhorn&#34;, to avoid the perception that this was a boring release (supposing that Windows 2006 would sound less exciting than Windows XP). The company considered several names from simple numbers such as &#34;Windows Seven&#34; or &#34;Windows 7&#34;, or letters (like XP), to other more fanciful, inventive names. In the end, Microsoft chose <i>Windows Vista</i>, believing it to be a &#34;wonderful intersection of what the product really does, what Windows stands for, and what resonates with customers, and their needs.&#34; Group Project Manager Greg Sullivan told Paul Thurrott — &#34;You want the PC to adapt to you and help you cut through the clutter to focus on what’s important to you. That&#39;s what Windows Vista is all about: <i>&#34;bringing clarity to your world.&#34;</i> (a reference to the three marketing points of Vista — Clear, Connected, Confident), so you can focus on what matters to you.&#34; Microsoft co-president Jim Allchin also loved the name, saying that <b>&#34;Vista&#34;</b> creates the right imagery for the new product capabilities and inspires the imagination with all the possibilities of what can be done with Windows -- making people’s passions come alive.&#34;<sup id="_ref-roadtogold4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roadtogold4" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>Compared with the WinHEC build released earlier in the year, Vista Beta 1 was a large advancement in introducing new user interface features. The Windows Shell was drastically changed yet again, introducing virtual folders, a new search interface, a number of new high-resolution icons, and a revamped Windows Explorer interface which did away with the menus and most of the toolbar buttons that were present in previous versions. Beta 1 also introduced many of the underlying technologies slated for Vista, including the new networking and audio stacks, parental controls, and fairly complete working build of <a href="/wiki/.NET_Framework_3.0" id="w">.NET Framework 3.0</a>, then still referred to as <i>WinFX</i>.</p>

Although not enabled by default, this refresh saw the return of the <a href="/wiki/Windows_Sidebar" id="w">Windows Sidebar</a>, which had been removed as part of the development reset, and the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Desktop_Gadgets" id="w">Desktop Gadgets</a>, both of which are part of <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_gadgets" id="w">Microsoft gadgets</a> line of mini-applications, which are similar to <a href="/wiki/Yahoo_Widget_Engine" id="w">Yahoo Widget Engine</a>&#39;s widgets.

Although Microsoft has stated that WinFS will not make its wide-reaching debut in Windows Vista, users of the 5219 build noticed that WinFS was in fact included in that version.

Microsoft cancelled the November CTP due to its instability, and decided to release it only to TAP members. Sidebar was temporarily removed; the build had a few new UI changes, including the ability to change the color and clarity of the UI. Windows AntiSpyware (soon to be &#34;Windows Defender&#34;) was integrated. Also, this build featured an updated version of Windows Mail. It was an IDW build and therefore had not gone through the CTP testing process. It leaked to the Internet on <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>.</p>

This build was shipped to technical beta testers and some corporate customers by Microsoft and was being used as a testing board for the extensive feedback they got from the February CTP. They described this release as an &#34;External Developer Workstation&#34;, with the intent of providing an interim build between CTPs. Microsoft claimed it was still on track to deliver the next CTP in the second quarter, the build that will be the last in the Beta 2 fork. The build included minor UI changes, most notably improvements to the Media Center, new Aero and Aurora effects, a faster setup process, some new Sidebar gadgets, and slight improvements in overall performance and stability. Paint was also slightly improved, there&#39;s a new screenshot snapping/saving tool included, and a slightly redesigned Network Center. This build did not meet CTP quality measurements, and was available only in Ultimate Edition, for both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) systems.</p>

Some technology web sites described this release as &#34;the largest download event in software history&#34;.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>In June, Microsoft made two significant changes to their plans for Windows Vista. One issue, the inclusion of <a href="/wiki/XML_Paper_Specification" id="w">XML Paper Specification</a> support in Vista and <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2007" id="w">Microsoft Office 2007</a>, had become a major point of dispute with <a href="/wiki/Adobe_Systems" id="w">Adobe Systems</a>. When it was first introduced May 2005, XPS (known at the time as &#34;Metro&#34;) was characterized as a &#34;PDF-killer&#34;, but an Adobe representative stated that they were &#34;not threatened&#34; by its addition to &#34;Longhorn&#34;.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> However, a year later, Adobe had changed their stance, and saw the inclusion of the new document format as an anti-competitive attack on their <a href="/wiki/Portable_Document_Format" id="w">Portable Document Format</a> format. While Microsoft refused to remove XPS altogether, noting that it is at the core of Vista&#39;s print <a href="/wiki/Spooling" id="w">spooling</a> system, they have offered the ability to system builders and OEMs to remove any user-visible aspects of the document format from the operating system.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> A few days later, it was announced that PC-to-PC Sync would not ship with Windows Vista.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_14" id="w">June 14</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, Windows developer Philip Su posted a blog entry which decried the development process of Windows Vista, stating that &#34;the code is way too complicated, and that the pace of coding has been tremendously slowed down by overbearing process. &#34;<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> The same post also described Windows Vista as having approximately 50 million <a href="/wiki/Lines_of_code" id="w">lines of code</a>, with about 2,000 developers working on the product.</p>
<a id="Pre-RC1" name="Pre-RC1"></a><h2>Pre-RC1</h2>
<p><b>Build 5456</b> (build date of <a href="/wiki/June_20" id="w">June 20</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>) was released on <a href="/wiki/June_24" id="w">June 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>. Some of the new features included a revamped Aero subsystem, and a completely overhauled and significantly less obtrusive User Account Control interface. &#34;List view&#34; in Windows Explorer was brought back, after having been removed in Beta 1. Microsoft developer Ben Betz later explained in a blog entry that, while they felt that removing List mode made sense based on usability research and its inability to support Windows Explorer&#39;s new &#34;grouping&#34; feature, the feature was restored based on a great deal of feedback from beta testers.<sup id="_ref-benbetz_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-benbetz" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>The release notes for the build state that the Time Zone bug that plagued almost all previous builds of Windows Vista had been patched, and quite a few issues in the Regional Settings and IME had also been resolved. A new &#34;Windows Aero&#34; mouse pointer scheme was introduced, which introduced <a href="/wiki/Anti-aliasing" id="w">anti-aliasing</a> to the mouse pointer for the first time, and many of the remaining Windows XP-style icons have been replaced with new icons.

<p><b>Build 5728</b> (build date of <a href="/wiki/September_17" id="w">September 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>) was released on <a href="/wiki/September_22" id="w">September 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> to technical beta participants. The following day, Microsoft released a 32-bit version of the build to the public, with a 64-bit version arriving on September 25. On October 1, Microsoft reached its goals for program participation and no longer offered the build to the public. In response to a significant amount of feedback from RC1 testers, 5728 contained many improvements, one of which was the inclusion of a check box in the Sound properties that allowed the user to disable the Windows Vista startup sound.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> The Welcome Center was also improved with new icons, eliminating the use of one icon for several different items, and all of the old icons in the User folder were replaced. With this build, Microsoft neared its goal of Vista installing in 15 minutes,<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> with some reviewers reporting that 5728 took as little as 16 minutes to do a clean install.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> However, performing an upgrade installation from Windows XP was still slow, sometimes taking more than an hour to complete.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<a id="RC2" name="RC2"></a><h2>RC2</h2>
<p><b>Release Candidate 2 (RC2)</b> (built on <a href="/wiki/October_3" id="w">October 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> with a build number of <b>5744.16384</b>), was released to CPP members, TAP testers, MSDN/Technet subscribers, and other technical beta testers on Friday, <a href="/wiki/October_6" id="w">October 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, and was available for download until October 9. Because of an aggressive development schedule, this was the final build that would be officially released to the general public for testing. Nevertheless, all pre-release product keys will work until the final RTM build. Several testers reported that RC2 was faster and more stable than build 5728.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> However, because RC2, which was a regular interim build, and not a major milestone as the name suggests, was not as rigorously tested as RC1, RC1 may have been more stable in certain situations. This build fixed many compatibility issues that plagued previous builds. Vista&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" id="w">GUI</a>, which continued to be improved, contained some minor tweaks, one of the more prominent of which was the new ability to customize the color, but not the transparency, of maximized windows. In previous builds, windows became predominantly black when maximized, an effect that could not be altered by users.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> A Control Panel icon for Windows Sideshow was also added.</p>
<a id="Pre-RTM" name="Pre-RTM"></a><h2>Pre-RTM</h2>
<p>Because a <a href="/wiki/Release_to_manufacturing" id="w">release to manufacturing</a> (RTM) build is the final version of code shipped to retailers and other distributors, the purpose of a pre-RTM build is to eliminate any last &#34;show-stopper&#34; bugs that may prevent the code from responsibly being shipped to customers, as well as anything else that consumers may find annoying. Thus, it is unlikely that any major new features will be introduced; instead, work will focus on Vista&#39;s &#34;fit-and-finish&#34;. In just a few days, developers had managed to drop Vista&#39;s bug count from over 2470 on September 22 to just over 1400 by the time RC2 shipped in early October. However, they still had a ways to go before Vista was ready to RTM. Microsoft&#39;s internal processes required Vista&#39;s bug count to drop to 500 or fewer before the product could go into escrow for RTM.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> For most of these builds, only 32-bit versions were released.</p>
<p><b>Build 5808</b> (build date of <a href="/wiki/October_12" id="w">October 12</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>) was released to TAP testers on <a href="/wiki/October_19" id="w">October 19</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>.<sup id="_ref-build5808_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-build5808" title="">[50]</a></sup> This build was notable because it was the first build released to testers since Microsoft entered RTM &#34;escrow&#34; with build 5800. This explains why the build numbers jumped from 57xx to 58xx.</p>
<p><b>Build 5824</b> (build date of <a href="/wiki/October_17" id="w">October 17</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>) was released to a wide number of internal testers later that day in the hope that this build would become the final RTM.{{Fact}} However, a catastrophic &#34;show-stopper&#34; bug was found that destroyed any system that was upgraded from Windows XP. Only completely reinstalling Windows would fix the computer.</p>
<p><b>Build 5840</b> (build date of <a href="/wiki/October_18" id="w">October 18</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>) was made available to internal testers. According to Paul Thurrott, this build did not contain the major bug in build 5824, and testing produced very positive feedback. This build contained a large number of new and final icons, as well as a new set of final wallpapers, including a new default wallpaper based on the Aurora &#34;swoosh&#34; seen in prior builds.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>

With this release the build number for Vista jumped to 6001.16659.070916.1443. This build also removed the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) from client computers, to be replaced by a downloadable version at a later date. This build broke the &#34;HP Touch smart&#34; family family of applications, and also caused bugs with resuming from sleep, and in some cases rendered some 64-bit PCs with Trusted Platform Module TPM)chips unable to finish booting. This build also contained unspecified improvements in Speed and responsiveness of the OS.</p>
