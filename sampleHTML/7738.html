<b>Chiropractic</b> (from <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> <i>chiros</i> and <i>praktikos</i> meaning &#34;done by hand&#34;) is a <a href="/wiki/Health_care" id="w">health care</a> <a href="/wiki/Profession" id="w">profession</a> whose purpose is to diagnose and treat mechanical disorders of the <a href="/wiki/Vertebral_column" id="w">spine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Musculoskeletal_system" id="w">musculoskeletal system</a>  with the intention of affecting the <a href="/wiki/Nervous_system" id="w">nervous system</a> and improving <a href="/wiki/Health" id="w">health</a>.<sup id="_ref-ccestandards_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ccestandards" title="">[1]</a></sup> It is based on the premise that a <a href="/wiki/Vertebral_column" id="w">spinal joint</a> dysfunction can interfere with the nervous system and result in many different conditions of diminished health.  While some <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Chiropractic" id="w">chiropractors</a> use the term <a href="/wiki/Vertebral_subluxation" id="w">vertebral subluxation</a> to describe what they treat, others have dropped this concept and concentrate mostly on the musculoskeletal components of spinal injury and rehabilitation of the spine.<sup id="_ref-paradigm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paradigm" title="">[2]</a></sup> In contrast, the term <a href="/wiki/Subluxation" id="w">subluxation</a> as used in conventional medicine is usually associated with specific conditions which are a direct consequence of injury to joints or associated nerves.</p>
<p>Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by <a href="/wiki/Daniel_David_Palmer" id="w">D. D. Palmer</a>, and it is now practiced in more than 100 countries.<sup id="_ref-fclb-qa_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fclb-qa" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Chiropractic_treatment_techniques" id="w">Chiropractic treatments</a> vary depending on the patient&#39;s condition and the type of approach taken by the particular chiropractor. They commonly include <a href="/wiki/Spinal_adjustment" id="w">spinal adjustments</a>, although other interventions may be used as well.</p>
<p>Today there are four main groups of chiropractors: &#34;traditional straights&#34;, &#34;objective straights&#34;, &#34;mixers&#34;, and &#34;reform&#34;. All groups, except reform, treat patients using a subluxation-based system. Differences are based on the philosophy for adjusting, claims made about the effects of those adjustments, and various additional treatments provided along with the adjustment.</p>
<p>Since its inception, Chiropractic has been the subject of controversy, criticism, and outright attacks from critics, both from within and outside the profession, and from researchers in the scientific community.  Historically, these have indirectly led to the scientific investigation of chiropractic and an <a href="/wiki/Antitrust" id="w">antitrust</a> suit against the <a href="/wiki/American_Medical_Association" id="w">American Medical Association</a>.  As a direct result of this criticism, as well as the relative dissatisfaction with its medical counterpart, surveys show that chiropractic patients have the highest satisfaction rate among the various healthcare disciplines.<sup id="_ref-Wilk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wilk" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="History_of_the_basic_subluxation_premise" name="History_of_the_basic_subluxation_premise"></a><h1> History of the basic subluxation premise </h1>

<p>Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by <a href="/wiki/Daniel_David_Palmer" id="w">Daniel David Palmer</a> to correct what he termed <a href="/wiki/Vertebral_subluxation" id="w">vertebral subluxations</a>. It was originally theorized that a vertebral subluxation was a misaligned vertebrae that pinched a nerve. It was thought that this interfered with the information the nerve was transmitting between the central nervous system and the structures of the body. Palmer thought that living things had an <a href="/wiki/Innate_Intelligence" id="w">Innate Intelligence</a> that used the nervous system to control the body, leading him to conclude that 95% of all health problems were due to vertebral subluxations and the remaining 5% were due to other joint misalignments. In 1996, it was proposed that a vertebral subluxation is more aptly defined as, &#34;a complex of functional and/or structural and/or pathological <a href="/wiki/Articular" id="w">articular</a> changes that compromise neural integrity and may influence organ system function and general health&#34; <sup id="_ref-ACA_paradigm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ACA_paradigm" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Early on, Palmer described this concept as similar to applying pressure to a water hose that supplies a garden - relieve the pressure and the garden flourishes. While the &#34;pinched garden hose theory&#34; has mostly been abandoned - although it is still may be used in a modified form by some chiropractors to explain a vertebral subluxation - the concept of the subluxation remains integral to a typical chiropractic practice. In 2003, a survey showed that 90% of North American chiropractors believed the vertebral subluxation complex played a significant role in all or most diseases.<sup id="_ref-mcdonald_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcdonald" title="">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Joint_manipulation" id="w">Manipulation</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Vertebral_column" id="w">spine</a>, when performed by a chiropractor, is frequently referred to as an <a href="/wiki/Spinal_adjustment" id="w">adjustment</a>. Though spinal manipulation for back pain has been documented from the time of the ancient Egyptians,<sup id="_ref-Homola_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Homola" title="">[9]</a></sup> and early <a href="/wiki/Osteopath" id="w">osteopaths</a> practiced generalized spinal maneuvers, the attempt to precisely correct theoretical vertebral subluxations is a uniquely chiropractic endeavor.</p>

<p>DD Palmer, using a <a href="/wiki/Vitalism" id="w">vitalistic</a> approach, imbued the term <a href="/wiki/Vertebral_subluxation" id="w">subluxation</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Metaphysics" id="w">metaphysical</a> and <a href="/wiki/Philosophical" id="w">philosophical</a> meaning. He held that a malposition of spinal <a href="/wiki/Bone" id="w">bones</a>, which protect the spinal cord and nerve roots, interfered with the transmission of nerve impulses. Because half of the nervous system is sensory and the other half motor (control), he postulated that living things had an <a href="/wiki/Innate_intelligence" id="w">Innate intelligence</a>, a kind of &#34;spiritual energy&#34; or <a href="/wiki/Life_force" id="w">life force</a> that received the sensory information from the various parts of the body and made a decision as to what the motor nerves should convey. DD Palmer claimed that subluxations interfered with this innate intelligence, and that by fixing them, all diseases could be treated.<sup id="_ref-textbook_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-textbook" title="">[10]</a></sup>  He qualified this by noting that knowledge of Innate Intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.<sup id="_ref-Forgotten Theories_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Forgotten Theories" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>  
<p>The idea that all diseases were the result of a subluxation was in line with the common thinking of the day; that there was one cause for disease. The vitalistic concepts implied an intelligent governing entity that was readily perceived as spiritual constructs by many both inside and outside the profession. Chiropractors used these metaphorical concepts to rationalize their thinking about the body’s self-healing capacity.<sup id="_ref-Chiro Beliefs_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chiro Beliefs" title="">[12]</a></sup> In 1998, Lon Morgan DC, a reform chiropractor, wrote that: &#34;Innate Intelligence clearly has its origins in borrowed mystical and occult practices of a bygone era. It remains untestable and unverifiable and has an unacceptably high penalty/benefit ratio for the chiropractic profession. The chiropractic concept of Innate Intelligence is an anachronistic holdover from a time when insufficient scientific understanding existed to explain human physiological processes. It is clearly religious in nature and must be considered harmful to normal scientific activity.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Morgan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Morgan" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meridel I. Gatterman DC, educator and writer observed: 
</p><dl><dd>&#34;The word subluxation has been ... embodied with a multitude of meaning by chiropractors during the past one hundred years. To some it has become the holy word; to others, an albatross to be discarded ... to add to the confusion, more than 100 synonyms for subluxation have been used. Why then do we persist in using the term when it has become so overburdened with clinical, political, and philosophical ... significance ... that the concept that once helped to hold a young profession together now divides it and keeps it quarrelling over basic semantics? The obvious answer is: The concept of subluxation is central to chiropractic.&#34;<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Subluxation. Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins, 1988:6. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.jcca-online.org/client/cca/JCCA.nsf/objects/Commentary:+Subluxation-the+silent+killer/$file/2-commentary.pdf#search=%22Homola%20DC%22" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.jcca-online.org/client/cca/JCCA.nsf/objects/Commentary:+Subluxation-the+silent+killer/$file/2-commentary.pdf#search=%22Homola%20DC%22">referenced in</a></p>
<p>Debate about the need to remove the concept of subluxation from the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing since the mid 1960s. While straights hold firmly to the term and its vitalistic construct, reformers suggest that the mechanistic model will allow chiropractic to better integrate into mainstream medicine without making claims inherent in the term. Anthony Rosner PhD, director of education and research at the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (FCER) considered subluxation and the concept of <a href="/wiki/Occam%26%2339%3Bs_razor" id="w">Occam&#39;s razor</a>. He suggests &#34;there is no obvious reason to discard the concept of subluxation, while at the same time maintaining that it is not a rigid entity, but rather an important model and concept; a work in progress that undoubtedly will undergo extensive modification as our concepts of light or psychoanalysis have evolved over half a century.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Anthony Rosner_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anthony Rosner" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the term&#39;s vitalistic roots, chiropractic today may still use the term Innate Intelligence; however, it has taken on a less metaphysical meaning. Innate Intelligence today is used to describe the self-healing power of the body. Thus, a modern chiropractic view is that by removing the restrictions caused by subluxation, the chiropractor is improving the body&#39;s own potential for self-healing.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that not all chiropractic institutions subscribe to the vertebral subluxation theory.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Chiropractic%E2%80%99s_approach_to_healthcare" name="Chiropractic%E2%80%99s_approach_to_healthcare"></a><h1> Chiropractic’s approach to healthcare </h1>

<p>According to Robert Mootz <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Chiropractic" id="w">D.C.</a> and Reed Phillips <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Chiropractic" id="w">D.C.</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ph.D." id="w">Ph.D.</a>, although chiropractic has much in common with other health professions, its philosophical approach distinguishes it from modern medicine. Chiropractic philosophy involves what has been described as a &#34;contextual, naturopathic approach&#34; to health care.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> The traditional, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Allopathic_medicine" id="w">allopathic</a>&#34; or &#34;medical&#34; model considers disease as generally the result of some external influence, such as a toxin, a parasite, an allergen, or an infectious agent: the solution is to counter the perceived environmental factor (e.g., using an antibiotic for a bacterial infection). By contrast, the <i>naturopathic</i> approach considers that lowered &#34;host resistance&#34; is necessary for disease to occur, so the appropriate solution is to direct treatment to strengthen the host, regardless of the environment. In contemporary clinical practice, one can find elements of both naturopathic and allopathic philosophy among all types of providers.<sup id="_ref-Chiro Beliefs_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chiro Beliefs" title="">[12]</a></sup>  The degree to which a practitioner emphasizes different tenets of these philosophies is one factor that determines the manner in which they practice.</p>

<p>The Chiropractic approach to healthcare stresses the importance of prevention. Former president of National College of Chiropractic, Joseph Janse DC (1909-1985) explains: 
</p><dl><dd>&#34;Unless pathology is demonstrable under the microscope, as in the laboratory or by roentgenograms, to them [allopaths] it does not exist. For years the progressive minds in chiropractic have pointed out this deficiency. With emphasis they [chiropractors] have maintained the fact that prevention is so much more effective than attempts at a cure. They pioneered the all-important principle that effective eradication of disease is accomplished only when it is in its functional (beginning) phase rather than its organic (terminal) stage. It has been their contention that in general the doctor, the therapist and the clinician have failed to realize exactly what is meant by disease processes, and have been satisfied to consider damaged organs as disease, and to think in terms of sick organs and not in terms of sick people. In other words, we have failed to contrast disease with health, and to trace the gradual deteriorization along the downward path, believing almost that mild departures from the physiological normal were of little consequence, until they were replaced by pathological changes...&#34;</dd></dl>
<p>Most patients who visit a chiropractor do so initially with a <a href="/wiki/Chief_complaint" id="w">chief complaint</a> related to musculoskeletal problems (especially low back and neck pain), although most chiropractors say they concern themselves with the overall health of the patient. According to a survey by the <a href="/wiki/National_Center_for_Complementary_and_Alternative_Medicine" id="w">National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine</a>, in 2002, chiropractic was the fourth (7.5%) most commonly used <a href="/wiki/Alternative_medicine" id="w">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)</a> therapy among adults in the USA.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> The profession has evolved so that treatment consists of hundreds of different techniques.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>  The U.S. Department of Labor&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Occupational_Outlook_Handbook" id="w">Occupational Outlook Handbook</a> said:

Friend and Rev. Samuel Weed suggested combining the words <i>cheiros</i> and <i>praktikos</i> (meaning &#34;done by hand&#34;) to describe Palmer&#39;s treatment method, creating the term &#34;<i>chiropractic.&#34;</i> In 1896, DD added a school to his magnetic healing infirmary, and began to teach others his method. It would become known as Palmer School of Chiropractic (now <a href="/wiki/Palmer_College_of_Chiropractic" id="w">Palmer College of Chiropractic</a>), located in <a href="/wiki/Davenport%2C_Iowa" id="w">Davenport, Iowa</a>. </p>

<p>In September 1899, a medical doctor in Davenport, IA, named Heinrich Matthey started a campaign against drugless healers in Iowa.  DD Palmer, whose school had just graduated its 7th student, insisted that his techniques did not need the same courses or license as medical doctors, as his graduates did not prescribe drugs or evaluate blood or urine. However, in 1906, Palmer was convicted for practicing medicine without a license.  He chose to turn over his interests in the PSC to his son, BJ and wife, Mabel.</p>

<p>BJ created the Universal Chiropractic Association (UCA) for the purpose of protecting its members by covering their legal expenses should they get arrested.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Its first case came in 1907, when Shegataro Morikubo DC of Wisconsin was charged with unlicensed practice of <a href="/wiki/Osteopathy" id="w">osteopathy</a>. Morikubo was freed using the defense that chiropractic philosophy was different from osteopathic philosophy.  The victory reshaped the development of the chiropractic profession, which then marketed itself as a science, an art <i>and a philosophy</i>, and BJ Palmer became the &#34;Philosopher of Chiropractic&#34;.</p>
<a id="Straight_versus_mixer" name="Straight_versus_mixer"></a><h2> Straight versus mixer </h2>

<p>State laws to regulate and protect chiropractic practice were eventually introduced in all fifty states in the US, but it was a hard-fought struggle. Medical Examining Boards worked to keep all healthcare practices under their legal control, but an internal struggle among DCs on how to structure the laws significantly complicated the process. Initially, the UCA, led by BJ Palmer and armed with his philosophy, opposed state licensure altogether. Palmer feared that such regulation would lead to allopathic control of the profession.<sup id="_ref-Chiro Educ_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chiro Educ" title="">[24]</a></sup> The UCA eventually caved in, but BJ remained strong in the opinion that examining boards should be composed exclusively of chiropractors (not those who mixed chiropractic with other remedies).

DeBoer, then an instructor in basic science at Palmer College in Iowa, revealed the power of a scholarly journal (JMPT) to empower faculty at the chiropractic schools.

<p>Until 1983, the AMA held that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with an &#34;unscientific practitioner&#34;, and labeled chiropractic &#34;an unscientific cult&#34;. Principle 3 of the AMA Principles of Medical Ethics stated: 
</p><dl><dd>&#34;A physician should practice a method of healing founded on a scientific basis; and he should not voluntarily professionally associate with anyone who violates this principle.&#34;</dd></dl>
<p>A Chicago chiropractor, Chester A.

<p>Chiropractic researchers Robert Mootz and Reed Phillips suggest that, in chiropractic&#39;s early years, influences from both straight and mixer concepts were incorporated into its construct. They conclude that chiropractic has both <a href="/wiki/Materialism" id="w">materialistic</a> qualities that lend themselves to scientific investigation and <a href="/wiki/Vitalism" id="w">vitalistic</a> qualities that do not (Table 1). </p>
<p>With relatively little federal funding, academic research in chiropractic has only recently become established in the USA. In 1994 and 1995, half of all grant funding to chiropractic researchers was from the US Health Resources and Services Administration (7 grants totaling $2.3 million). The Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (11 grants, $881,000) and the Consortium for Chiropractic Research (4 grants, $519,000) accounted for most of the rest. By 1997, there were 14 peer-reviewed chiropractic journals in English that encouraged the publication of chiropractic research, including <i>The Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics (JMPT)</i>, <i>Topics in Clinical Chiropractic</i>, and the <i>Journal of Chiropractic Humanities</i>. However, of these, only <i>JMPT</i> is included in <i><a href="/wiki/Index_Medicus" id="w">Index Medicus</a></i>. Research into chiropractic, whether from Universities or chiropractic colleges, is however often published in many other scientific journals.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>While there is still debate about the effectiveness of chiropractic for the many conditions in which it is applied, chiropractic seems to be most effective for acute low back pain and tension headaches.<sup id="_ref-Duke_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Duke" title="">[30]</a></sup> When testing the efficacy of health treatments, <a href="/wiki/Double_blind" id="w">double blind</a> studies are considered acceptable scientific rigor. These are designed so that neither the patient nor the doctor knows whether they are using the actual treatment or a placebo (or &#34;sham&#34;) treatment. However, chiropractic treatment involves a <a href="/wiki/Spinal_adjustment" id="w">manipulation</a>; &#34;sham&#34; procedures cannot be easily devised for this, and even if the patient is unaware whether the treatment is a real or sham procedure, the doctor cannot be unaware. Thus there may be &#34;observer bias&#34; - the tendency to see what you expect to see, and the potential for the patient to wish to report benefits to &#34;please&#34; the doctor. Similarly, it is often difficult to devise a sham procedure for surgical procedures, but it is not impossible. It is also a problem in evaluating treatments; even when there are objective outcome measures, the <a href="/wiki/Placebo_effect" id="w">placebo effect</a> can be very substantial. Thus, DCs have historically relied mostly on their own clinical experience and the shared experience of their colleagues, as reported in <a href="/wiki/Case_studies" id="w">case studies</a>, to direct their treatment methods. In this, they are not different to the practice in much of conventional medicine. {{Or}}</p>
<p>There is evidence that <a href="/wiki/Joint_manipulation" id="w">spinal manipulation</a> is effective for the treatment of acute low back pain, tension headaches and some musculoskeletal issues, but not all studies support this conclusion.<sup id="_ref-Duke_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Duke" title="">[30]</a></sup> A systematic review of systematic reviews in 2006 by Ernst and Cantor concluded that &#34;Collectively these data do not demonstrate that spinal manipulation is an effective intervention for any condition. Given the possibility of adverse effects, this review does not suggest that spinal manipulation is a recommendable treatment.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Ernst E_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ernst E" title="">[31]</a></sup> In 2007, Ernst performed another review, drawing similar conclusions.<sup id="_ref-ernst2007_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ernst2007" title="">[32]</a></sup>  A commentary from a chiropractic and osteopathic journal disputed Ernst and Cantor&#39;s conclusion as, &#34;..definitely not based on an acceptable quality review of systematic reviews and should be interpreted very critically by the scientific community, clinicians, patients, and health policy makers. Their conclusions are certainly not valid enough to discredit the large body of professionals utilizing spinal manipulation.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>	
<p>One controlled trial showed a lowering of blood pressure in hypertensive patients similar to taking two blood-pressure lowering drugs at once<sup id="_ref-Bakrus_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bakrus" title="">[34]</a></sup> after alignment of the atlas vertebra.</p>
<p>Sociologist Leslie Biggs interviewed 600 Canadian DCs in 1997: while 86% felt that chiropractic methods needed to be validated, 74% did not believe that controlled clinical trials were the best way to evaluate chiropractic. Moreover, 68% believed that &#34;most diseases are caused by spinal malalignment&#34;, although only 30% agreed that &#34;subluxation was the cause of many diseases&#34;.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even when a valid mechanism of action is not determined, it is generally thought sufficient to present evidence showing benefit for the claims made. There is wide agreement that, where applicable, an <a href="/wiki/Evidence_based_medicine" id="w">evidence based medicine</a> framework should be used to assess health outcomes, and that systematic reviews with strict protocols are important for objectively evaluating treatments. Where evidence from such reviews is lacking, this does not necessarily mean that the treatment is ineffective, only that the case for a benefit of treatment may not have been rigorously established.</p>
<p>A 2005 editorial in <i>JMPT</i>, &#34;The <a href="/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration" id="w">Cochrane Collaboration</a>: is it relevant for doctors of chiropractic?&#34;<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> proposed that involvement in Cochrane collaboration would be a way for chiropractic to gain greater acceptance within medicine. The collaboration has 11,500 contributors from more than 90 countries organized in 50 review groups. For chiropractic, relevant review groups include the Back Group; the Bone, Joint, and Muscle Trauma Group; the Musculoskeletal Group; and the Neuromuscular Disease Group. The editorial states that, for example, &#34;a chiropractor may provide conservative care supported by a Cochrane review to a patient with carpal tunnel syndrome. If the patient&#39;s symptoms become progressive, the doctor may consider referring the patient for surgery using a recent Cochrane review that examined new surgical techniques compared with traditional open surgery...&#34;</p>
<p>The Cochrane Collaboration did not find enough evidence to support or refute the claim that manual therapy (including, but not limited to, chiropractic) is beneficial for <a class="externallink" href="http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001002.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001002.html">asthma</a>. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003219.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003219.html">Carpal tunnel syndrome</a> trials have not shown benefit from diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, magnets, laser acupuncture, exercise or chiropractic and there is not enough evidence to show the effects of spinal <a href="/wiki/Joint_manipulation" id="w">manipulation</a> (including, but not limited to, chiropractic) for

<p>According to Bandolier, a systematic review of a small, poor quality set of trials provided no convincing evidence for long-term benefits of chiropractic interventions for acute or chronic low back pain, despite some positive overall findings<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> but there might be some short-term pain relief, especially in patients with acute pain.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> However, the <a href="/wiki/BMJ" id="w">BMJ</a> noted in a study on long-term low-back problems &#34;...improvement in all patients at three years was about 29% more in those treated by chiropractors than in those treated by the hospitals. The beneficial effect of chiropractic on pain was particularly clear.&#34;<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup>
A 1994 study by the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services endorses spinal <a href="/wiki/Joint_manipulation" id="w">manipulation</a> for acute low back pain in adults in its Clinical Practice Guideline.</p>
<p>The first significant recognition of the appropriateness of spinal <a href="/wiki/Joint_manipulation" id="w">manipulation</a> for low back pain was performed by the <a href="/wiki/RAND" id="w">RAND</a> Corporation. This meta-analysis concluded that some forms of spinal <a href="/wiki/Joint_manipulation" id="w">manipulation</a> were successful in treating certain types of lower back pain. Some chiropractors claimed these results as proof of chiropractic hypotheses, but RAND&#39;s studies were about spinal <a href="/wiki/Joint_manipulation" id="w">manipulation</a>, not <a href="/wiki/Spinal_adjustment" id="w">chiropractic</a> specifically, and dealt with appropriateness, which is a measure of net benefit and harms; the efficacy of chiropractic and other treatments were not explicitly compared. In 1993, Dr Shekelle rebuked some DCs for their exaggerated claims: ...we have become aware of numerous instances where our results have been seriously misrepresented by chiropractors writing for their local paper or writing letters to the editor....<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>There is conflict in the results of chiropractic research. For instance, many DCs claim to treat <a class="externallink" href="http://www.chiroweb.com/find/tellmeabout/colic.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.chiroweb.com/find/tellmeabout/colic.html">infantile colic</a>. According to a 1999 survey, 46% of chiropractors in Ontario treated children for <a href="/wiki/Baby_colic" id="w">colic</a>.<sup id="_ref-Verhoef_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Verhoef" title="">[41]</a></sup> In 1999 a Danish randomized controlled clinical trial with a blinded observer suggested that there is evidence that spinal manipulation might help infantile colic.<sup id="_ref-Wiberg_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wiberg" title="">[42]</a></sup> However, in 2001, a Norwegian blinded study concluded that chiropractic spinal <a href="/wiki/Spinal_adjustment" id="w">manipulation</a> was no more effective than placebo for treating infantile colic.<sup id="_ref-Olafsdottir_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Olafsdottir" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1997, historian Joseph Keating Jr described chiropractic as a &#34;science, antiscience and pseudoscience&#34;, and said &#34;Although available scientific data support chiropractic&#39;s principle intervention method (the manipulation of patients with lower back pain), the doubting, skeptical attitudes of science do not predominate in chiropractic education or among practitioners&#34;. He argued that chiropractic&#39;s culture has nurtured antiscientific attitudes and activities, and that &#34;a combination of uncritical rationalism and uncritical empiricism has been bolstered by the proliferation of pseudoscience journals of chiropractic wherein poor quality research and exuberant over-interpretation of results masquerade as science and provide false confidence about the value of various chiropractic techniques&#34;. However, in 1998, after reviewing the articles published in the <i>JMPT</i> from 1989-1996, he concluded, 
</p><dl><dd>&#34;substantial increases in scholarly activities within the chiropractic profession are suggested by the growth in scholarly products published in the discipline&#39;s most distinguished periodical (JMPT). Increases in controlled outcome studies, collaboration among chiropractic institutions, contributions from nonchiropractors, contributions from nonchiropractic institutions and funding for research suggest a degree of professional maturation and growing interest in the content of the discipline.&#34;<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<a id="The_Manga_Report" name="The_Manga_Report"></a><h4> The Manga Report </h4>

<p>The Manga Report was an outcomes-study funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and conducted by three health economists led by Professor <a href="/wiki/Pran_Manga" id="w">Pran Manga</a>. The Report supported the scientific validity, safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of chiropractic for low-back pain, and found that chiropractic care had higher patient satisfaction levels than conventional alternatives. The report states that &#34;The literature clearly and consistently shows that the major savings from chiropractic management come from fewer and lower costs of auxiliary services, fewer hospitalizations, and a highly significant reduction in chronic problems, as well as in levels and duration of disability.&#34;<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Workers'_Compensation_studies" name="Workers'_Compensation_studies"></a><h4> Workers&#39; Compensation studies </h4>

<p>In 1998, a study of 10,652 Florida workers&#39; compensation cases was conducted by Steve Wolk. He concluded that &#34;a claimant with a back-related injury, when initially treated by a chiropractor versus a medical doctor, is less likely to become temporarily disabled, or if disabled, remains disabled for a shorter period of time; and claimants treated by medical doctors were hospitalized at a much higher rate than claimants treated by chiropractors.&#34;<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> Similarly, a 1991 study of Oregon Workers&#39; Compensation Claims examined 201 randomly selected workers&#39; compensation cases that involved disabling low-back injuries: when individuals with similar injuries were compared, those who visited DCs generally missed fewer days of work than those who visited MDs.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>A 1989 study analyzed data on Iowa state records from individuals who filed claims for back or neck injuries. The study compared benefits and the cost of care from MDs, DCs and DOs, focusing on individuals who had missed days of work and who had received compensation for their injuries. Individuals who visited DCs missed on average 2.3 fewer days than those who visited MDs, and 3.8 fewer days than those who saw DOs, and accordingly, less money was dispersed as employment compensation on average for individuals who visited DCs.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1989, a survey by Cherkin <i>et al.</i> concluded that patients receiving care from health maintenance organizations in the state of Washington were three times as likely to report satisfaction with care from DCs as they were with care from other physicians. The patients were also more likely to believe that their chiropractor was concerned about them.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/WebMD" id="w">WebMD</a> has published several studies that promote the efficacy of chiropractic adjustments.  The first of these was published on October 12, 2004.  This study showed that not only did Chiropractic cut the cost of treating back pain by 28%, it also reduced hospitilizations by 41%, back surgeries by 32%, and reduced the cost of medical imaging, such as X-rays or MRIs, by 37%.  This was according to a study published in the Oct. 11 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine.  Although the researchers did not look at patient satisfaction in this study, Metz says company studies show that 95% of chiropractic care patients are satisfied with the care they receive..&#34;<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Practice_styles_and_schools_of_thought" name="Practice_styles_and_schools_of_thought"></a><h1> Practice styles and schools of thought </h1>

<p>Contemporary chiropractic can be divided into several approaches to patient care: all are based on non-invasive, non-medication approaches, with many based on the use of manipulation as a treatment for mechanical musculoskeletal dysfunction of the spine and extremities. Most chiropractors advertise themselves as primary care doctors, and consider themselves part of &#34;alternative health care,&#34; but there can be large differences between practitioners.<sup id="_ref-Healey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Healey" title="">[55]</a></sup> Those differences are reflected in the varied viewpoints of multiple national practice associations. While individual chiropractors may share the viewpoints of one or more organizations, most chiropractors are not members of any national organization.</p>
<a id="Traditional_Straight" name="Traditional_Straight"></a><h2> Traditional Straight </h2>

<p><i>Traditional Straight</i> chiropractors are the oldest movement. They adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by DD and BJ Palmer; that vertebral subluxation leads to interference of the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for almost any disease. Straights adhere to the chiropractic diagnosis of subluxations, and view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which they consider to be the &#34;secondary effects&#34; of subluxations) to be unnecessary for treatment. Instead, patients are typically screened for &#34;red flags&#34; of serious disease, and treated based on a practitioner&#39;s preferred chiropractic technique. This stance against medical diagnosing has been a source of contention between mixers and straights, because accreditation standards mandate that differential diagnosis be taught in all chiropractic programs so that patient care is safe and relevant to their complaints. Additionally, several state chiropractic licensing boards mandate that patient complaints be diagnosed before receiving care. Traditional straights tend to share the viewpoints found in the <a href="/wiki/International_Chiropractors_Association" id="w">International Chiropractors Association</a> (ICA), as well as the <a href="/wiki/Federation_of_Straight_Chiropractors_and_Organizations" id="w">Federation of Straight Chiropractors and Organizations</a> (FSCO) and the <a href="/wiki/World_Chiropractic_Alliance" id="w">World Chiropractic Alliance</a> (WCA).</p>
<a id="Mixer" name="Mixer"></a><h2> Mixer </h2>

<p><i>Mixer</i> chiropractors are an early offshoot of the straight movement. This branch originated from naturopathic, osteopathic, medical, and even chiropractic doctors who attended the <a href="/wiki/Palmer_College_of_Chiropractic" id="w">Palmer College of Chiropractic</a> and then re-organized the treatment system to include more diagnostic and treatment approaches. They eventually split from the traditional straight group and formed various other chiropractic schools including the <a href="/wiki/National_College_of_Chiropractic" id="w">National College of Chiropractic</a>. Their treatments may include naturopathic remedies, physical therapy devices, or other <a href="/wiki/Complementary_and_alternative_medicine" id="w">complementary and alternative medicine</a> (CAM) methods. While many are still subluxation based, mixers also treat problems associated with both the spine and extremities, including musculoskeletal issues such as pain and decreased range of motion. Mixers describe vertebral subluxations, which they may refer to as somatic dysfunctions or segmental dysfunctions, as a form of joint dysfunction or osteoarthritis. Diagnosis is made after ruling out other known disorders and noting general signs of mechanical dysfunction in the spine. Mixers tend to share the viewpoints found in the <a href="/wiki/American_Academy_of_Chiropractic_Physicians" id="w">American Academy of Chiropractic Physicians</a>, the <a href="/wiki/American_Academy_of_Spine_Physicians" id="w">American Academy of Spine Physicians</a>, and/or the <a href="/wiki/American_Chiropractic_Association" id="w">American Chiropractic Association</a> (ACA), and all the major groups in Europe are also members of the <a href="/wiki/European_Chiropractors_Union" id="w">European Chiropractors Union</a>.<sup id="_ref-Souza_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Souza" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Objective Straight</i> chiropractors<sup id="_ref-F.A.C.E._position_paper1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-F.A.C.E._position_paper1" title="">[57]</a></sup> are a minority group and a recent off-shoot of the traditional straights. This group is differentiated from traditional straights mainly by the claims made. While traditional straights claimed that chiropractic adjustments are a plausible treatment for a wide range of diseases, objective straights only focus on the correction of chiropractic vertebral subluxations. Like traditional straights, objective straights typically do not diagnose patient complaints. Their guiding principles are summed up as: &#34;We do not want to diagnose and treat diseases, even diseases of the spine.&#34; and &#34;We do not want chiropractic to be practiced as an alternative to medicine.&#34;<sup id="_ref-F.A.C.E._3_principles_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-F.A.C.E._3_principles" title="">[58]</a></sup> They also don&#39;t refer to other professionals, but do encourage their patients &#34;to see a medical physician if they indicate that they want to be treated for the symptoms they are experiencing or if they would like a medical diagnosis to determine the cause of their symptoms.&#34;<sup id="_ref-F.A.C.E._referral_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-F.A.C.E._referral" title="">[59]</a></sup> Most objective straights limit treatment to spinal adjustments.

<p><a href="/wiki/Manipulation_under_anesthesia" id="w">Manipulation under anesthesia</a> or MUA is spinal manipulation performed while the patient is under general anesthesia. This procedure is used in the hospital setting for patients whose condition is unresponsive to other forms of treatment.</p>
<p>Chiropractors generally cannot write <a href="/wiki/Medical_prescription" id="w">medical prescriptions</a>.  Traditionally, they consider the prescription of drugs the province of conventional medicine, with the chiropractor&#39;s role being to pursue drug-free alternative treatments.  More recently (2003), a survey of North American chiropractors found that a majority supported limited prescription rights.<sup id="_ref-mcdonald_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcdonald" title="">[8]</a></sup>  A notable exception is the state of Oregon, which allows chiropractors with minor additional qualification to prescribe over-the-counter drugs.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup>  Depending on the country or state in which a Chiropractic school is located, some chiropractors may obtain additional training to perform minor surgery, obstetrics and proctology.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> When indicated, the doctor of chiropractic consults with, co-manages, or refers to other health care providers.<sup id="_ref-ccestandards_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ccestandards" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
