<b>Hovhannes Khachatury Bagramyan</b> {{fn}} ({{lang-hy}}; {{lang-ru}}; {{OldStyleDate}} &#8211; <a href="/wiki/September_21" id="w">September 21</a> <a href="/wiki/1982" id="w">1982</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet</a> <a href="/wiki/Armenian_people" id="w">Armenian</a> military commander and <a href="/wiki/Marshal_of_the_Soviet_Union" id="w">Marshal of the Soviet Union</a>. During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, Bagramyan was the first non-<a href="/wiki/Slavic_people" id="w">Slavic</a> military officer to become a commander of a <a href="/wiki/Front_(Soviet_Army)" id="w">Front</a>. He was among several Armenians in the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Army" id="w">Soviet Army</a> who held the highest proportion of high ranking officers in the Soviet military during the war,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and one of fifty Armenians who attained the rank of General in the same period.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Bagramyan&#39;s experience in military planning as a chief of staff allowed him to distinguish himself as a capable commander in the early stages of the Soviet counter-offensives against <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Nazi Germany</a>. He was given his first command of a unit in 1942, and in November 1943 received his most prestigious command as the head of the <a href="/wiki/First_Baltic_Front" id="w">First Baltic Front</a>. As head of the Baltic Front, he participated in the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Offensive" id="w">offensives</a> which moved westward and pushed <a href="/wiki/Wehrmacht" id="w">German forces</a> out of the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_republics" id="w">Baltic republics</a>.</p>
<p>He did not immediately join the <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" id="w">Communist Party</a> after the consolidation of the <a href="/wiki/October_Revolution" id="w">October Revolution</a>, becoming a member only in 1941, which was atypical for a Soviet military officer. After the war, he served as a deputy member of the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Soviet" id="w">Supreme Soviets</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Latvian_SSR" id="w">Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Armenian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic" id="w">Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> and was a regular attendee of the <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" id="w">Party Congresses</a>. In 1952, he became a candidate for entry into the <a href="/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" id="w">Central Committee</a> and, in 1961, was inducted as a full member. Outside Armenia, he is primarily known by the <a href="/wiki/Russification" id="w">Russified</a> version of his name, <b>Ivan</b> (or <b>Ovannes</b>) <b>Khristoforovich Bagramyan</b> ({{lang-ru}}). For his contributions during the war, he was widely regarded as a national hero in the Soviet Union,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> and continues to hold such esteemed status among Armenians.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Hovhannes Bagramyan was the son of Khachatur Bagramyan, an Armenian railway worker, and was born in the village of Chardakhlu (now Çanlibel) near <a href="/wiki/Yelizavetpol" id="w">Yelizavetpol</a> (later <a href="/wiki/Kirovabad" id="w">Kirovabad</a>, now <a href="/wiki/Ganja" id="w">Ganja</a>, <a href="/wiki/Azerbaijan" id="w">Azerbaijan</a>), then part of the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" id="w">Russian Empire</a>. <a href="/wiki/Hamazasp_Babadjanyan" id="w">Hamazasp Babadjanyan</a>, who was to become the chief marshal of the Soviet Armor corps, was born in the same village. Like his father and his brothers, Bagramyan followed a path in rail work where he first attended a two year school in Yelizavetpol and later the railway technical institute in <a href="/wiki/Tiflis" id="w">Tiflis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(country)" id="w">Georgia</a> and became a train mechanic.<sup id="_ref-SovArm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SovArm" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

In 1915, he joined the Russian Army as a volunteer (to <a href="/wiki/Detachment_(military)" id="w">detachment</a> <a href="/wiki/Armenian_volunteer_units" id="w">volunteer units</a>) in the Second Caucasus Frontier Regiment of the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Caucasus_Army" id="w">Russian Expedition Corps</a> and spent the remainder of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> fighting the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" id="w">Ottoman Empire</a> on the Caucasian Front. In June, 1917 he graduated from the Tiflis military academy with the rank of <i><a href="/wiki/Praporshchik" id="w">praporshchik</a></i> in the Russian army.

<p>Following the toppling of the <a href="/wiki/Tsar" id="w">tsarist</a> government by the <a href="/wiki/Bolshevik" id="w">Bolsheviks</a> in October 1917, the Russian army invaded the southern Caucasus republics of <a href="/wiki/Azerbaijan" id="w">Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(country)" id="w">Georgia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Armenia" id="w">Armenia</a>. In May 1920, Bagramyan initiated a local rebellion against the <a href="/wiki/Dashnak" id="w">Dashnak</a>-led government of Armenia and joined the <a href="/wiki/11th_Soviet_Red_Army" id="w">Eleventh Soviet Red Army</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> He became the commander of a cavalry regiment, taking part in several battles during the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War" id="w">Russian Civil War</a>, and also fighting against Armenian and Georgian nationalist forces. In 1923, he was made the commander of the <a href="/wiki/Alexandropol" id="w">Alexandropol</a> Cavalry Regiment, a position he held until 1931.

In his memoirs, <a href="/wiki/Pyotr_Grigorenko" id="w">Pyotr Grigorenko</a>, a Ukrainian commander who attended Frunze, told how Bagramyan was expelled from the academy by his superiors after they learned he had been a secret member of the banned Dashnak Armenian nationalist party for more than a decade.

Concurrently, Soviet leader <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" id="w">Joseph Stalin</a> had <a href="/wiki/Great_Purge" id="w">purged</a> much of the Soviet officer corps of its &#34;experienced&#34; commanders.

<p>In 1940, when General Zhukov was promoted to commander of the Kiev <a href="/wiki/Military_District" id="w">Military District</a> in the Ukraine, Bagramyan wrote a letter asking to serve under his command. Zhukov agreed, and in December asked for his help writing a paper to be presented to the commanders of the Soviet Military Districts. Bagramyan&#39;s paper, <i>Conducting a Contemporary Offensive Operation,</i> apparently impressed Zhukov, as he promoted Bagramyan to become the head of Operations for the Soviet Twelfth Army based in the Ukraine.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Within three months however, Bagramyan, then a <a href="/wiki/Colonel" id="w">colonel</a>, was appointed deputy chief of staff of the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Southwestern_Front" id="w">Southwestern Front</a>, headquartered in Kiev.<sup id="_ref-SovArm_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SovArm" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>In June 1941, <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Nazi Germany</a> violated the <a href="/wiki/Molotov-Ribbentrop_Pact" id="w">Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact</a> and <a href="/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa" id="w">invaded</a> the Soviet Union. Unlike many of the border troops who were caught off guard by the offensive, Bagramyan and his commander, General <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Kirponos" id="w">Mikhail Kirponos</a> believed an invasion by Germany was inevitable.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> However, Kipronos chose to ignore Bagramyan&#39;s viewpoint that the German offensive would employ the lightning speed <a href="/wiki/Blitzkrieg" id="w">Blitzkrieg</a> tactics like those used in the campaigns in <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Poland</a> in 1939 and Western Europe in 1940.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>  Since the winter of 1939–40, Bagramyan had been busy devising a battle plan that would counter threats from the western Ukraine that was approved after numerous revisions on <a href="/wiki/May_10" id="w">May 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/1940" id="w">1940</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>On the morning of <a href="/wiki/June_22" id="w">June 22</a>, he was tasked with the overseeing of a transfer of a military convoy to <a href="/wiki/Ternopol" id="w">Ternopol</a>. While his column was passing the Soviet <a href="/wiki/Airfield" id="w">airfields</a> near the city of <a href="/wiki/Brody" id="w">Brody</a>, German air strikes hit the aircraft on the ground.

Khrushchev went on to detail an account in where Marshal <a href="/wiki/Semyon_Budyonny" id="w">Semyon Budyonny</a>, sent by the chief of the operations department from the Soviet capital of <a href="/wiki/Moscow" id="w">Moscow</a> to Kiev and representing the <a href="/wiki/STAVKA" id="w">STAVKA</a>, courtmartialed Bagramyan,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> who protested and stated that if he was an incapable staff officer, then he should instead be given a field unit to command. To Bagramyan&#39;s astonishment, Budyonny went on to attempt to convince him to agree to his execution. Khrushchev remarked that the argument was essentially sparked arbitrarily and had taken place after an &#34;abundant feast with cognac&#34; and that &#34;in those days we didn&#39;t take that kind of conversation seriously.&#34;<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> According to him, at the time however, the Soviet military was especially suspicious of the men in its ranks, itself judging that there were &#34;<a href="/wiki/Enemy_of_the_people" id="w">enemies of the people</a>...everywhere, especially the Red Army.&#34;<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>   </p>
<p>Bagramyan was instrumental in the planning of two Soviet counter-offensives against the Germans, including the major push made by Soviet forces in December during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Moscow" id="w">battle of Moscow</a>, and for this was promoted to the rank of <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_General" id="w">Lieutenant General</a>.<sup id="_ref-SovArm_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SovArm" title="">[4]</a></sup> In the same month, he was made the chief of staff of a military operations group that would oversee three Army Groups: the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Southern_Front" id="w">Southern</a>, the Southwestern and <a href="/wiki/Bryansk" id="w">Bryansk</a> Fronts.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> In March 1942, he went along with Khrushchev and Timoshenko to Moscow to present the plans of a new counter-offensive in the Ukrainian city of <a href="/wiki/Kharkov" id="w">Kharkov</a> to Stalin. Stalin, impressed with his plan, approved the operation and on <a href="/wiki/April_8" id="w">April 8</a>, promoted Bagramyan as Chief of Staff of the Southwestern Front. On <a href="/wiki/May_12" id="w">May 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>, armies of the Southwestern Front attacked Kharkov but the launch of the offensive came at an inopportune moment since they were attacking from the Barvenkovo <a href="/wiki/Salient" id="w">Salient</a>, a region that German forces were near closing.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>While Soviet forces were initially successful in <a href="/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Kharkov" id="w">recapturing Kharkov</a>, they found themselves trapped by the German army after the closing of Barvenkovo.

Though he had never led a fighting unit prior to the war, he was given his first command of an army in the Western Front as his superiors, and particularly field marshal Zhukov were impressed with his skills and capabilities as a staff officer.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Zhukov, with the approval of STAVKA, appointed him commander of the 16th Army, replacing its former commander, <a href="/wiki/Konstantin_Rokossovsky" id="w">Konstantin Rokossovsky</a> who had been sent to command the Bryansk Front. On <a href="/wiki/July_30" id="w">July 30</a>, Soviet forces launched a new offensive as a continuing part of the <a href="/wiki/Battles_of_Rzhev" id="w">Battles of Rzhev</a> in Western Russia in an effort to push back German forces that were advancing towards Moscow near the <a href="/wiki/Volga_River" id="w">Volga River</a>. For the next two weeks, Soviet forces were successful and made several gains in the region.  On <a href="/wiki/August_11" id="w">August 11</a>, however, German forces mounted a surprise offensive on the southern flank of Western Front, splitting the 61st Army from the 16th, both of which were not taking part in the July offensive.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> The German forces threatened Bagramyan&#39;s left flank as he quickly moved his forces to counter their movements and halted them from advancing further on <a href="/wiki/September_9" id="w">September 9</a>.</p>
<p>With the rest of the Eastern Front battles almost entirely focused on <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad" id="w">Stalingrad</a> and the Germans&#39; attempts to drive down to the <a href="/wiki/Caucasus" id="w">Caucasus</a> for further advancement towards south, the 16th Army was not called up to action until February 1943. By then, the <a href="/wiki/Sixth_Army_(Germany)" id="w">German Sixth Army</a> besieging Stalingrad had been encircled and surrendered as Soviet forces remained on the constant offense. The 16th Army at the time was composed of four divisions and one infantry <a href="/wiki/Brigade" id="w">brigade</a> and in light of the new offensive, Bagramyan&#39;s force was given two extra divisions, an <a href="/wiki/Infantry" id="w">infantry</a> brigade, four <a href="/wiki/Tank" id="w">tank</a> brigades and several <a href="/wiki/Artillery" id="w">artillery</a> regiments.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> The 16th Army launched an attack against German forces in Bryansk along the Western and Bryansk Fronts where it performed with distinction.

<a id="Kursk" name="Kursk"></a><h3>Kursk</h3>
<p>As the battle of Stalingrad marked the turning point of the war, German forces reorganized for a new offensive in the summer of 1943 to attack the Soviet held <a href="/wiki/Kursk" id="w">Kursk</a> salient in Russia. The German High Command was to utilize veteran units in its ambitions to destroy the salient, including the <a href="/wiki/Ninth_Army_(Germany)" id="w">Ninth Army</a> and the <a href="/wiki/II_SS_Panzer_Corps" id="w">II SS Panzer Corps</a>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> STAVKA, already informed of the impending attacks, called for an advance towards the German defenses positioned near the town of <a href="/wiki/Kozelsk" id="w">Kozelsk</a> which would push south where it would be aided by the armies of <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Central_Front" id="w">Central Front</a>. The forces would then proceed to cut off a 75-mile gap that would effectively surround the Germans and cut if off from reinforcements. This was similar to the 1942 launched <i><a href="/wiki/Operation_Uranus" id="w">Operation Uranus</a></i>, where the Soviet army encircled and trapped the Sixth Army in Stalingrad.

To avoid a repetition of the failure in Kharkov the previous year, he instead asked that the 61st Army from the Bryansk Front aid the Eleventh in destroying the German forces in Bolkhov, thus eliminating the Ninth Army&#39;s protection from the north.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> He appealed to his front commander <a href="/wiki/Vasily_Sokolovsky" id="w">Vasily Sokolovsky</a> as well the Bryansk&#39;s M. A. Reyter who both rejected his proposal. In April, STAVKA recalled the main commanders of the Fronts and Armies to Moscow on a briefing of the preparations for the battle. Against the protestations of Sokolovsky and Reyter, Bagramyan proposed his alternative plan to Stalin, who agreed and approved that it would be the more correct course to follow.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Bagramyan was given twenty days to prepare the Eleventh Army and on <a href="/wiki/May_24" id="w">May 24</a> reported that his forces were ready. The Eleventh Army now was composed of 135,000 men, 280 <a href="/wiki/Armored_fighting_vehicle" id="w">armored fighting vehicles</a>, 2,700 artillery pieces and several hundred planes to lend air support for the ground forces.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Stalin however, feeling it was necessary to further deteriorate the fighting abilities of German forces, delayed the offensive.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/July_5" id="w">July 5</a> <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a>, after several months of postponing the offensive, German forces launched <a href="/wiki/Operation_Citadel" id="w">Operation Citadel</a> in the area around Kursk. German losses were initially heavy due to Soviet defensive preparations. Taking advantage of this, on <a href="/wiki/July_12" id="w">July 12</a>, Bagramyan&#39;s forces commenced their offensive, codenamed <a href="/wiki/Operation_Kutuzov" id="w">Operation Kutuzov</a>, and quickly breached through German defenses, advancing a distance of 45 miles (72km) by <a href="/wiki/July_18" id="w">July 18</a>.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> By <a href="/wiki/July_28" id="w">July 28</a>, the operation successfully concluded and he was promoted to the rank of <a href="/wiki/Colonel-General" id="w">Colonel-General</a>.

With the end of operations in Kursk, the Soviets began a series of offensives on various fronts to push the Germans out of the occupied Soviet republics. In October 1943, Bagramyan&#39;s Eleventh Army was transferred to the Second Baltic Front which was concentrated on the retaking of <a href="/wiki/Belarus" id="w">Belarus</a> and namely, the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_republics" id="w">Baltic republics</a>. In November, Stalin offered Bagramyan the position of head commander of the <a href="/wiki/First_Baltic_Front" id="w">First Baltic Front</a> which had the similar objectives of the Second but was making little headway in its attempts to advance northwards.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Stalin would allow him to retain the Eleventh Army and suggested that Colonel-General N. E. Chibisov, an officer he had served under, assume his position. Bagramyan however commented that he had had a frictional relationship with Chibisov and instead nominated <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-General" id="w">Lieutenant-General</a> K. N. Galitsky. Stalin, belatedly realizing that Bagramyan was implying that the two would be unable to coherently coordinate together due to a conflict of holding the same rank, agreed to Bagramyan&#39;s suggestion and promoted him to the rank <a href="/wiki/General_of_the_Army_(USSR)" id="w">Army General</a>.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup>  He also agreed to have the Second Baltic Front return a tank corps and an infantry division that was taken from the Eleventh Army, thus bolstering the forces under Bagramyan to a total of four armies: the Eleventh, Thirty-ninth, Forty-third Guards and the Fourth Shock.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the winter of 1943, his forces advanced forward towards the Belarusian city of <a href="/wiki/Vitebsk" id="w">Vitebsk</a>. One of the keys of Bagramyan&#39;s progress was that many of the soldiers were part of veteran units that had been trained in the <a href="/wiki/Arctic" id="w">Arctic</a> regions of <a href="/wiki/Siberia" id="w">Siberia</a>,<sup id="_ref-TimeMag_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TimeMag" title="">[40]</a></sup> enabling them to easily push through entrenched defenses the Germans had spent months preparing. Among the key locations imperative to reach Vitebsk was the small town of <a href="/wiki/Gorodok" id="w">Gorodok</a>, serving as a communications hub that the Germans had heavily fortified. Despite the heavy defense preparations, Bagramyan was able to utilize his heavy artillery and air support from the <a href="/wiki/Red_Air_Force" id="w">Red Air Force</a> in late December to bombard the town and then launch a three-pronged attack from the ground.<sup id="_ref-TimeMag_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TimeMag" title="">[40]</a></sup> The German garrison was overwhelmed, and by <a href="/wiki/December_24" id="w">December 24</a>, two infantry divisions and one tank division surrendered.

<div class="thumbcaption">General deployments of Soviet and German forces during <i><a href="/wiki/Operation_Bagration" id="w">Operation Bagration</a></i> in June 1944.</div></div>

On <a href="/wiki/April_2" id="w">April 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a> Stalin granted Bagramyan&#39;s request to relieve the troops of the Front of offensive duties. However, German forces took this to their advantage as they mounted a new offensive against <a href="/wiki/Soviet_partisan" id="w">Soviet partisan</a> fighters in Belarus. Bagramyan&#39;s senior staff diverted air support and other crucial supplies to aid the partisans, allowing most of them to escape the German encirclement.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> With the advance of Soviet forces in the Baltic and the Ukraine, German <a href="/wiki/Army_Group_Center" id="w">Army Group Center</a> had largely been isolated as STAVKA prepared to eliminate the pocket (consisting of <a href="/wiki/III_Corps_(Germany)" id="w">Third Panzer</a>, Second, Fourth, and Ninth Armies). STAVKA&#39;s plan, codenamed <i><a href="/wiki/Operation_Bagration" id="w">Operation Bagration</a></i> was kept secret from all of the involved Front commanders. Bagramyan himself was only informed in May 1944 of his role in the offensive.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> </p>
<p><i>Bagration</i> called for the First, Second and Third Belarusian Fronts and the First Baltic to engulf Army Group Center. Bagramyan was tasked with attacking the forces in the pocket, cross the <a href="/wiki/Daugava_River" id="w">Daugava River</a> and, along with Third Belarusian, clear the surrounding areas of Vitebsk of German forces. Although he felt the plans for the <i>Bagration</i> were sound, he worried about the possibility of a German incursion by <a href="/wiki/Army_Group_North" id="w">Army Group North</a> against his forces from the north. He appealed to his superiors once more, Zhukov and <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Vasilevsky" id="w">Alexander Vasilevsky</a>, to have the First Baltic Front move westwards to help eliminate the Third Panzer Army, thus splitting Army Group North in two.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> Zhukov and Vasilevsky accepted his argument, introducing it to Stalin in a meeting on <a href="/wiki/May_23" id="w">May 23</a> who formally approved it in a directive on <a href="/wiki/May_31" id="w">May 31</a>.</p>
<p>Although Bagramyan found it acceptable to sustain heavy casualties (as did all the commanders of the Red Army), he was disturbed with the immense loss of life the war was taking against his men.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> He, however, attempted to reduce those levels primarily by maintaining the element of surprise in operations. In his preparations for <i>Bagration</i>, he planned for the Forty-third army to move through the more geographically difficult swamps and marshlands to Army Group North&#39;s right flank. This maneuver would thus take North by surprise since it expected the Soviet offensive to move through more suitable terrain.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> He proved correct, as in early June 1944, the Forty-third Army achieved success in its attack. Commander of the Forty-third Army, General A. P. Beloborodov wrote that during the offensive, they apprehended a German general who stated that German forces had been blindsided by the attacking forces.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> </p>
<p>As Bagramyan pushed towards Vitebsk, his forces were aided by the same Belarusian <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla" id="w">guerrilla</a> fighters that had escaped the German encirclement in April. They provided vital intelligence, including information on the location of bridges and troop movements, and launched attacks against German logistics lines. On <a href="/wiki/June_22" id="w">June 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>, <i>Bagration</i> began as Bagramyan proceeded in moving westwards as previously planned. However, a widening gap on the Front&#39;s northern flank grew as it advanced while the Second Baltic Front, tasked to help defend that area, took no action.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> Stalin agreed to send a tank corps to reinforce Bagramyan&#39;s forces but ordered him to capture <a href="/wiki/Polatsk" id="w">Polatsk</a>, which would sever Army Group North&#39;s communication lines and open up a route towards the central Baltic. By <a href="/wiki/July_3" id="w">July 3</a>, his troops had accomplished the tasks set forth in the directive, destroyed the Third Panzer Army and captured Polatsk.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> For his achievements, on <a href="/wiki/July_7" id="w">July 7</a> he was decorated with the title of <a href="/wiki/Hero_of_the_Soviet_Union" id="w">Hero of the Soviet Union</a>.<sup id="_ref-SovArm_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SovArm" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

With the overall success of Soviet forces in <i>Bagration</i>, his Front was expanded by three armies (although he ceded the Fourth Shock Army to Second Baltic), the Thirty-ninth army (previously under the command of Third Belarusian), the Fifty-first and the Second Guard Armies.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> The First Baltic Front was ordered by STAVKA to move westward in order to stop Army Group North&#39;s remaining forces from escaping to Germany. Despite this, Bagramyan understood that many of the general orders being given to the German Army were directed by the country&#39;s leader, <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Adolf Hitler</a>, rather than the General Staff and knew that while there was a possibility that they would confront them in the <a href="/wiki/Lithuania" id="w">Lithuanian</a> city of <a href="/wiki/Kaunas" id="w">Kaunas</a>, he felt the more likely location would be in <a href="/wiki/Latvia" id="w">Latvia</a>&#39;s capital, <a href="/wiki/Riga" id="w">Riga</a>.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> He spoke with Vasilevsky who agreed to change the plans if his theory and intuition proved correct. </p>
<p>As the First Baltic began moving towards Lithuania and into eastern Latvia, it became clear that Army Group North would attempt to outflank Bagramyan&#39;s forces near <a href="/wiki/Daugavpils" id="w">Daugavpils</a>, as he had previously predicted. Vasilevsky, keeping his promise, appealed to Stalin to allow Bagramyan to move to Daugavpils but he refused to do so.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> Vasilevsky in turn, took it upon his own initiative and gave Bagramyan the go ahead. However, with the loss of the Fourth Shock, Bagramyan was left shortchanged since his promised Thirty Ninth Army had not only not arrived but was composed of only seven divisions (in comparison to the Fourth&#39;s ten). Feeling that time was being lost, he pressed on with the units he had. </p>
<p>By <a href="/wiki/July_9" id="w">July 9</a>, his ground forces had made significant gains in cutting off a vital road that connected Kaunas to Daugavpils. Taking advantage of this, Bagramyan worked with other Front commanders to attack the rear guard of Army Group Center but poor coordination between the units led a stall in the advance.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> At this time, Bagramyan realized that German forces were most probably not going to easily retreat from the Baltics and so further advances towards Kaunas would be pointless. He proposed to STAVKA to launch a full-scale offensive towards Riga but the former rejected his plans, stating that the armies of Second and Third Baltic Fronts would have already pushed Army Group Center to Prussia by the time of the offensive.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> He attempted to convince them otherwise, citing the numerically deficient forces in the two Fronts, but was rebuffed and ordered to drive towards a road connecting the Lithuania city of <a href="/wiki/Šiauliai" id="w">Shaulyai</a> to Riga, resulting in its capture in late July. </p>
<p>With its capture, he persuaded Vasilevsky to allow his forces to move towards Riga, receiving a formal go-ahead by STAVKA in a directive on <a href="/wiki/July_29" id="w">July 29</a>. On <a href="/wiki/July_30" id="w">July 30</a>, his forces finally reached the seaside city of <a href="/wiki/Tukums" id="w">Tukums</a>, near the <a href="/wiki/Bay_of_Riga" id="w">Bay of Riga</a>,<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> thereby cutting off a total of 38 German infantry and armored divisions in Latvia.<sup id="_ref-SovArm_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SovArm" title="">[4]</a></sup> For his achievements in this battle, he was given the title of <a href="/wiki/Hero_of_the_Soviet_Union" id="w">Hero of the Soviet Union</a>. During the month of August, Soviet forces stalled in the Riga offensive, concentrating on halting German attacks. Finally on <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>, the First, Second and Third Baltic Fronts launched full scale offensives with the objective of Riga, encountering fierce resistance by its defenders. On <a href="/wiki/September_24" id="w">September 24</a>, with his forces only 12 miles (19&#160;km) from Riga, STAVKA ordered Bagramyan&#39;s forces to abandon it to the Second and Third Baltic Fronts, regroup, and instead advance against <a href="/wiki/Klaip%C4%97da" id="w">Memel</a>. His forces <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Memel" id="w">attacked Memel</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_5" id="w">October 5</a> and on <a href="/wiki/October_10" id="w">October 10</a>, reached the city, effectively preventing Army Group North from retreating to Prussia.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> </p>   
<p>In early 1945, Bagramyan&#39;s army, under the overall command of Vasilievsky, took part in the advance into <a href="/wiki/East_Prussia" id="w">East Prussia</a>. In <i><a href="/wiki/Battle_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg" id="w">Operation Samland</a></i>, Bagramyan&#39;s First Baltic Front, now known as the <a href="/wiki/Sambia" id="w">Samland</a> Group, captured <a href="/wiki/K%C3%B6nigsberg" id="w">Königsberg</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Kaliningrad" id="w">Kaliningrad</a>) in April.
