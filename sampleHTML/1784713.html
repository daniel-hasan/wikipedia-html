<div class="thumbcaption">Lalonde with the 1910-11 Canadiens</div>
<b>Edouard &#34;Newsy&#34; Lalonde</b> (<a href="/wiki/October_31" id="w">October 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/1887" id="w">1887</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cornwall%2C_Ontario" id="w">Cornwall, Ontario</a> - <a href="/wiki/November_21" id="w">November 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canadian</a> professional <a href="/wiki/Ice_hockey" id="w">ice hockey</a> forward in the <a href="/wiki/National_Hockey_League" id="w">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) and a professional <a href="/wiki/Lacrosse" id="w">lacrosse</a> player, regarded as one of hockey&#39;s and lacrosse&#39;s greatest players of the first half of the 20th century and one of sport&#39;s most colourful characters.  He played for the <a href="/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens" id="w">Montreal Canadiens</a> -- considered to be the original &#34;Flying Frenchman&#34; -- in the <a href="/wiki/National_Hockey_Association" id="w">National Hockey Association</a> and the <a href="/wiki/NHL" id="w">NHL</a>. He also played for the <a href="/wiki/WCHL" id="w">WCHL</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Saskatoon_Sheiks" id="w">Saskatoon Sheiks</a>.  Before playing professional ice hockey, he worked in a newspaper plant, where he acquired the &#34;Newsy&#34; <a href="/wiki/Moniker" id="w">moniker</a>. The image on the right is of Lalonde, in the 1910-11 season and the second version of the Montreal uniform, the &#34;CH&#34; sweater was still almost a decade away.</p>
<a id="Early_hockey_career" name="Early_hockey_career"></a><h2>Early hockey career</h2>
<p>In the 1904, Lalonde started his career with the <a href="/wiki/Cornwall_Victorias" id="w">Cornwall Victorias</a> of the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL).  In 1905, he played for the Woodstock club of the <a href="/wiki/Ontario_Hockey_Association" id="w">Ontario Hockey Association</a> Senior A League.  Lalonde made the trek to <a href="/wiki/Sault_Ste._Marie%2C_Ontario" id="w">Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario</a> in 1906 to play in the <a href="/wiki/International_Professional_Hockey_League" id="w">International Professional Hockey League</a>, hockey&#39;s first known professional league.  In his one season in the Sault, he was named to the IHL Second All-Star Team.  In 1907, Lalonde signed with the <a href="/wiki/Toronto_(OPHL)" id="w">Toronto Professionals</a> of the Ontario Professional Hockey League, and with linemates <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Ridpath" id="w">Bruce Ridpath</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wally_Mercer" id="w">Wally Mercer</a> led the &#34;Torontos&#34; to the league championship, losing the Cup in a tight match with the <a href="/wiki/Montreal_Wanderers" id="w">Montreal Wanderers</a> in which Lalonde scored twice. </p>
<p>1910 saw the foundation of the <a href="/wiki/National_Hockey_Association" id="w">National Hockey Association</a> (NHA), precursor to the NHL, and Lalonde joined the <a href="/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens" id="w">Montreal Canadiens</a> for their first season.  Halfway through the season, the Habs traded him to the <a href="/wiki/Renfrew_Creamery_Kings" id="w">Renfrew Creamery Kings</a>, with whom Newsy led the league in scoring.  He rejoined the Canadiens for the 1911 season -- professional hockey was only then developing any sense of teams retaining the rights  to their players -- during which he had several stick battles and provoked the ire of opposing fans. </p>
<p>With the formation of the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Hockey_Association" id="w">Pacific Coast Hockey Association</a> (PCHA) in 1912, Lalonde jumped to the <a href="/wiki/Vancouver_Millionaires" id="w">Vancouver Millionaires</a>, and promptly led the league in scoring its inaugural year. Vancouver traded him back to Montreal the following season for <a href="/wiki/Didier_Pitre" id="w">Didier Pitre</a>. In 1915, Lalonde held out in contract negotiations, only playing six games, but aside from that, he remained with the Canadiens for the next ten years, winning the NHL scoring title again in 1916 and captaining the Canadiens to his only <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Cup" id="w">Stanley Cup</a> victory.</p>
<a id="NHL/WCHL_career" name="NHL/WCHL_career"></a><h2>NHL/WCHL career</h2>
<p>Newsy Lalonde played (and scored) in the first-ever NHL game on December 19th, <a href="/wiki/1917-18_NHL_season" id="w">1917</a>, when the Montreal Canadiens defeated the <a href="/wiki/Ottawa_Senators_(Original)" id="w">Ottawa Senators</a>, 7-4. He would score in each of the first six NHL games, earning a share of an NHL record with <a href="/wiki/Cy_Denneny" id="w">Cy Denneny</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joe_Malone" id="w">Joe Malone</a> to establish an NHL record that would go unmatched for nearly 90 years. (The record was tied by <a href="/wiki/Evgeni_Malkin" id="w">Evgeni Malkin</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins" id="w">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_1" id="w">November 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>.)</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/1918-19_NHL_season" id="w">1919</a> <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Cup" id="w">Stanley Cup</a> playoffs, Lalonde scored a spectacular seventeen goals in ten games. However, the series was cancelled after five games, due to the <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Cup#1919 Flu Epidemic: Stanley Cup Cancelled" id="w">Stanley Cup flu epidemic</a>. The final game was never played, because <a href="/wiki/Joe_Hall" id="w">Joe Hall</a>, Manager Kennedy, <a href="/wiki/Billy_Coutu" id="w">Billy Coutu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jack_McDonald_(ice_hockey)" id="w">Jack McDonald</a>, <a href="/wiki/Louis_Berlinquette" id="w">Louis Berlinquette</a> and Lalonde were hospitalized with influenza, leading the Cup trustees to call off the series. Joe Hall did not survive.</p>
<p>Thereafter Lalonde had two fine years, but after the sale of the Canadiens to <a href="/wiki/Leo_Dandurand" id="w">Leo Dandurand</a>, his clashes with the new ownership affected his play to the point where he left the team for four games, and he was relegated to reserve duty amidst the boos of the fans.  Accordingly, Dandurand sold Lalonde to Saskatoon the following year in violation of the waiver regulations then in force.  The deal was disputed, and eventually -- and grudgingly -- the Canadiens accepted the amateur <a href="/wiki/Aurel_Joliat" id="w">Aurel Joliat</a> in compensation. ( When Lalonde and Joliat met later that season,   Lalonde,unhappy that Joliat was fast becoming a fan favorite in Montreal,  got his &#34;revenge&#34; by serving Joliat with a vicious crosscheck to the face. ) </p>
<p>On a line with future Hall of Famer <a href="/wiki/Bill_Cook" id="w">Bill Cook</a>, Lalonde achieved his final scoring title as playing coach of the Sheiks, although the team had a poor overall record.  The next two seasons the team was much improved, but Lalonde himself was finally feeling his age and was no longer an impact player.  He scored the final goal of his career on March 2, 1925, against Vancouver.  The following season he played three regular season games and two playoff games, the last for the Saskatoon franchise before the <a href="/wiki/Western_Hockey_League" id="w">Western Hockey League</a> folded.</p>
<p>The following season, <a href="/wiki/1926-27_NHL_season" id="w">1927</a>, Lalonde was named the head coach of the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Americans" id="w">New York Americans</a>.  He played as a substitute for one final game in November of 1926 before hanging up his skates for good.  After his retirement, he also served as the head coach of the <a href="/wiki/Ottawa_Senators_(Original)" id="w">Ottawa Senators</a> between <a href="/wiki/1929-30_NHL_season" id="w">1929</a> and <a href="/wiki/1930-31_NHL_season" id="w">1931</a>, and of the Canadiens between <a href="/wiki/1931-32_NHL_season" id="w">1932</a> and <a href="/wiki/1934-35_NHL_season" id="w">1935</a>.</p>
<a id="Lacrosse_career" name="Lacrosse_career"></a><h2>Lacrosse career</h2>
<p>Although Lalonde is best-remembered today as a hockey player, he was just as prominent in lacrosse, which in the early years of the 20th century was one of the most popular professional sports in Canada. Lalonde earned more in lacrosse than he did in hockey. He started play in 1905 as a goaltender, but moved to the attack position in 1910, becoming the sport&#39;s greatest star. He would break the scoring record for his Montreal team in 1910 with 31 goals. In 1912, he was signed to be player-manager of the Toronto Lacrosse Club, but almost immediately changed his mind and joined the exodus of players heading west for big contracts. He was signed by Con Jones to play for <a href="/wiki/Vancouver" id="w">Vancouver</a> for $5,500 for one season. In comparison, as a hockey player, his salary in 1910-11 for the Montreal Canadiens was $1,300, which was considered high for the time. As late as 1920 he couldn&#39;t get more than $2,000 a year playing hockey. Lalonde scored an incredible 66 goals for the Montreal Nationals in 1914. His final full season was in 1917, but played a handful of games the following year to end his lacrosse career.</p>
<a id="Assessment" name="Assessment"></a><h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>A leading scorer for the Canadiens in six years, he served as <a href="/wiki/Captain_(hockey)" id="w">captain</a> from 1915 to 1921. He was a member of the first Montreal Canadiens team to win the Stanley Cup in 1916. He was scoring champion five times in the <a href="/wiki/National_Hockey_Association" id="w">National Hockey Association</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Hockey_Association" id="w">Pacific Coast Hockey Association</a> and <a href="/wiki/National_Hockey_League" id="w">National Hockey League</a>, an unprecedented feat in the major professional ranks and unsurpassed until <a href="/wiki/Gordie_Howe" id="w">Gordie Howe</a>&#39;s sixth scoring title in 1963.  From 1910 to 1954, he held the record for the most goals scored by a major league hockey player, including his pre-NHL totals -- 441 goals, a record later broken by Maurice Richard.</p>
<p>In 1950, he was named athlete of the half century in lacrosse. He was also elected to the <a href="/wiki/Hockey_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in 1950, the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Lacrosse_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame</a> in 1965, and the Sports Hall of Fame of Canada. He had lit the torch when the Sports Hall of Fame opened in Toronto in <a href="/wiki/August" id="w">August</a>, <a href="/wiki/1955" id="w">1955</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a>, 71 years after his last game and 76 years after initial retirement, he was ranked number 32 on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hockey_News" id="w">The Hockey News</a><b> list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, making him the highest-ranking player on the list who had played in a professional league before the founding of the NHL.</b></i></p>
