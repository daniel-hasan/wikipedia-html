<p>The <b>History of Dedham, Massachusetts from 1793 to 1999</b> begins with the naming of <a href="/wiki/Dedham%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Dedham</a> as the shiretown of the newly formed Norfolk County.  Being named county seat brought an influx of new residents and visitors to town and Dedham experienced rapid growth with the new turnpikes and railroads.  The Town was central to three major court cases, the <a href="/wiki/Fairbanks_Case" id="w">Fairbanks Case</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Dedham_Case" id="w">Dedham Case</a>, and the world famous <a href="/wiki/Sacco_and_Vanzetti" id="w">Sacco and Vanzetti</a> Case.</p>
<a id="Shire_town" name="Shire_town"></a><h1>Shire town</h1>
<p>When <a href="/wiki/Norfolk_County%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Norfolk County</a> was formed in 1793 Dedham was named as the <a href="/wiki/Shire_town" id="w">shire town</a> and &#34;an influx of lawyers, politicians, and people on county business forced the town to abandon its traditional insularity and its habitual distrust of newcomers.&#34;<sup id="_ref-DHS Capsule_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DHS Capsule" title="">[1]</a></sup>  A new county courthouse was built by <a href="/wiki/Solomon_Willard" id="w">Solomon Willard</a>, the same architect who built the <a href="/wiki/Bunker_Hill_Monument" id="w">Bunker Hill Monument</a>.  When it was remodeled in 1863 a dome was added, but it was too large and had to be removed.  A new dome sits atop the building today.<sup id="_ref-stories_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stories" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the new residents of Dedham was <a href="/wiki/Horace_Mann" id="w">Horace Mann</a>, who lived for several years at the Norfolk House and opened a law office in December of 1823.<sup id="_ref-reg mann_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reg mann" title="">[3]</a></sup>  He soon &#34;became interested in town affairs, was often chosen Moderator of the town meetings, and was an early candidate for office.&#34;<sup id="_ref-reg mann_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reg mann" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Mann served as Dedham&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Representative in General Court</a> from 1827 to 1832 as well as on the School Committee.<sup id="_ref-reg mann_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reg mann" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-globe school_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-globe school" title="">[4]</a></sup>  In only his first year in Dedham he was invited to deliver the <a href="/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)" id="w">Independence Day</a> address at which President <a href="/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams" id="w">John Quincy Adams</a> was in attendance.  In his speech he &#34;outlined for the first time the basic principles that he would return to in his subsequent public statements, arguing that education, intelligent use of the elective franchise, and religious freedom are the means by which American liberties are preserved.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Horace Mann_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Horace Mann" title="">[5]</a></sup>  After the address Adams &#34;expressed great confidence in the future career of Mr. Mann.&#34;<sup id="_ref-reg mann_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reg mann" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Turnpikes, including those linking <a href="/wiki/U.S._Route_1" id="w">Boston and Providence</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hartford_and_Dedham_Turnpike" id="w">Dedham and Hartford</a>, were laid through town during the first few years of the 19th century.  Inns and taverns sprung up along the new roads as more than 600 coaches would pass through Dedham each day on their way to Boston or Providence.<sup id="_ref-Tale_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tale" title="">[6]</a></sup>  The stable behind Gay&#39;s Tavern could hold over 100 horses and eight horse teams could be switched within two minutes.<sup id="_ref-Hanson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hanson" title="">[7]</a></sup>  On the walls of the taverns were small boxes into which money could be dropped and on the outside of which was written &#34;To Insure Promptness.&#34;  Eventually they became known as TIP boxes and while the boxes have since been removed the custom of voluntarily leaving extra money behind for quality service has remained.<sup id="_ref-Old_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Old" title="">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1802 a local mason named Martin Marsh built his brick home at what is today 19 Court Street and was then right on one of the new turnpikes.    He saw the traffic flowing daily past his house and quickly turned his home into a tavern.  His establishment, the Norfolk House, like the other inns and taverns in Dedham at that time, were bustling with the arrival of both the turnpikes and the courts.  He maintained the tavern until 1818, and then sold it to Moses Gray and Francis Alden.  It was this partnership that hosted President <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Jackson" id="w">Andrew Jackson</a> for lunch as he and his entourage passed through town in 1832.<sup id="_ref-Hanson_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hanson" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Norfolk House was also a hotbed for Republican politics in its day.  It competed with the Democratic Phoenix House, so named because it rebuilt after having been destroyed by arson, which stood at the site of the present day Knights of Columbus building on the corner of Washington and High streets in Dedham Square.  The proprietors of the two establishments generally stayed away from each other but &#34;every once in a while they slipped and then there would be a short burst of newspaper venom.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Hanson_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hanson" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>A young Congressman named <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" id="w">Abraham Lincoln</a> gave a speech at the Norfolk House<sup id="_ref-Tale_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tale" title="">[6]</a></sup> on <a href="/wiki/September_20" id="w">September 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1848" id="w">1848</a> while in Massachusetts to campaign for <a href="/wiki/Zachary_Taylor" id="w">Zachary Taylor</a>.<sup id="_ref-Chelsea_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chelsea" title="">[9]</a></sup>  He appeared uncomfortable as he arrived but</p>
<p /><blockquote>
<p>His indifferent manner vanished as soon as he opened his mouth.  He went right to work. He turned up the cuffs of his shirt.  Next, he loosened his necktie, and soon after it he took it off altogether.  All the time, he was gaining upon his audience.  He soon had it as by a spell.  I never saw men more delighted.  He began to bubble out with humor.  For plain pungency of humor, it would have been difficult to surpass his speech.  The speech ended in a half-hour.  The bell that called to the steam cars sounded.  Mr. Lincoln instantly stopped.  ‘I am engaged to speak at Cambridge tonight, and I must leave.’  The whole audience seemed to rise in protest.  ‘Go on!  Finish it!’ was heard on every hand.  One gentleman arose and pledged to take his horse and carry him across country.  But Mr. Lincoln was inexorable.<sup id="_ref-Lincoln_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lincoln" title="">[10]</a></sup>

<p>The Norfolk House was also the site where &#34;on <a href="/wiki/June_4" id="w">June 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1810" id="w">1810</a>, in an expression of public outrage, a number of Dedham citizens assembled&#34; and founded the <a href="/wiki/Society_in_Dedham_for_Apprehending_Horse_Thieves" id="w">Society in Dedham for Apprehending Horse Thieves</a>.

<a id="The_Fairbanks_case" name="The_Fairbanks_case"></a><h2>The Fairbanks case</h2>
<p>The first major trial to be held at the new courthouse was that of <a href="/wiki/Jason_Fairbanks" id="w">Jason Fairbanks</a>.  He lived in the family homestead on East Street and was courting Elizabeth Fales, two years his junior at 18.  Jason had told a friend that &#34;planned to meet Betsey, in order to have the matter settled&#34; and that he &#34;either intended to violate her chastity, or carry her to Wrentham, to be married, for he had waited long enough.&#34;<sup id="_ref-report_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-report" title="">[12]</a></sup>  On <a href="/wiki/May_21" id="w">May 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1801" id="w">1801</a>, Fales met Fairbanks in a &#34;birch grove next to &#39;Mason’s Pasture&#39;&#34; and told him that she could not marry him.<sup id="_ref-Fairbanks_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fairbanks" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fales was stabbed 11 times, including once in the back, and her throat was slashed.  Fairbanks staggered to her home, covered in blood, and told her family that she had committed suicide.  He also told them that he had also attempted to take his own life, but was unable to, and that accounted for his wounds<sup id="_ref-Fairbanks_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fairbanks" title="">[13]</a></sup> which left him &#34;&#34;still alive,

<p>Fairbanks&#39; murder trial opened on <a href="/wiki/August_5" id="w">August 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1801" id="w">1801</a> at the Courthouse but interest in the case involving two prominent families was so great that the trial was moved to the First Parish Meetinghouse across the street.  When that venue proved to still be too small, the trial again moved to the Town Common.  Prosecuting the case was the then-Attorney General and later Governor <a href="/wiki/James_Sullivan" id="w">James Sullivan</a> and defending Fairbanks was future Boston mayor and US Senator, <a href="/wiki/Harrison_Gray_Otis_(lawyer)" id="w">Harrison Gray Otis</a>.  The trial lasted three days after which Fairbanks was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging.  He escaped on August 18, at which time a $1,000 bounty offered for his capture and a newspaper implored readers to &#34;Stop the Murderer!&#34;<sup id="_ref-Fairbanks_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fairbanks" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fairbanks was captured in <a href="/wiki/Whitehall_(village)%2C_New_York" id="w">Skeensborough, New York</a> as he attempted to escape to Canada.  On September 10 he was returned to Dedham from the Boston jail and was hanged.  To ensure that he would not escape again two Army Cavalry and one volunteer militia units stood guard.  In addition to the military presence, &#34;the 10,000 people who showed up at the Town Common to witness the execution were five times the town’s population at the time.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Fairbanks_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fairbanks" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Within days of the execution the first of four instalments of the <i>Report of the Trial of Jason Fairbanks</i> was published by the Boston firm Russell and Cutler.

<p>In the early 19th century, all Massachusetts towns were Constitutionally required to tax their citizens &#34;for the institution of the public worship of God, and for the support and maintenance of public Protestant teachers of piety.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Constitution_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Constitution" title="">[17]</a></sup>  All residents of a town were assessed, as members of the parish, whether or not they were also members of the church.

<p>In 1818 &#34;Dedham [claimed] rights distinct from the church and against the vote of the church.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Golini_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Golini" title="">[18]</a></sup>  The town, as the parish, selected a liberal Unitarian minister, Rev. Alvan Lamson, to serve the First Church in Dedham.  The members of the church were more traditional and rejected Lamson by a vote of 18-14.  When the parish installed and ordained Lamson the majority of the Church left &#34;with Deacon [Samuel] Fales who took parish records, funds and silver with him.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Burt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Burt" title="">[19]</a></sup>  The parish, along with the members of the church who remained, installed their own deacons and sued to reclaim the church property.</p>

<p>In 1837, the year after the first rail line came to town, Dedham had a population of 3,532.  By then the mills and factories in town were producing cotton and woolen goods, leather, boots, shoes, paper, marbled paper, iron castings, chairs, cabinet wares, straw bonnets, palm-leaf hats, and silk goods.  Together they were worth $510,755 with the silk goods alone worth $10,000.  Dedham Village was described at the time as &#34;very pleasant, and possesses every inducement to render it a desirable residence for the mechanic or man of leisure.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Hayward_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hayward" title="">[23]</a></sup>  The &#34;scenery&#34; of the town was described as &#34;varied and picturesque&#34; with &#34;an appearance of being well kept, and the roads are noticeably good.&#34;<sup id="_ref-gazetteer_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gazetteer" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dedham played a role in the development of <a href="/wiki/Baseball" id="w">baseball</a>.  On May 13, 1858 members of the various <a href="/wiki/Town_ball" id="w">town ball</a> teams in the Boston area met in Dedham to form the Massachusetts Association of Baseball Players.  The Association developed a set of rules that came to be known as <a href="/wiki/The_Massachusetts_Game" id="w">The Massachusetts Game</a>.  There were no foul balls, four bases, and games lasted until one team had scored 100 runs.<sup id="_ref-baseball_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baseball" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1888 Dedham&#39;s 6,641 residents lived in 1,228 dwellings and had 97 farms.  The farms produced a product valued at $5,273,965 and yet was only $192,294 in 1885.   The two major banks included the Dedham National Bank with over $300,000 in capital and the Dedham Institution for Savings with more than $2,000,000 in deposits.  There were two weekly newspapers, the Dedham Standard and the Dedham Transcript.  The first public schoolhouse in the country had by this time grown &#34;complete system of graded schools, which are provided for in thirteen buildings having a value of about $60,000; to which has recently been added a new high school building in a central location in which have been embodied all known improvements.&#34;<sup id="_ref-gazetteer_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gazetteer" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>On January 11, 1895 the citizens of the town gathered in Memorial Hall to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the first free, tax supported public school in the nation.  A &#34;felicitous&#34; speech was made by Governor <a href="/wiki/Frederic_T._Greenhalge" id="w">Frederic T. Greenhalge</a> and an &#34;historical address&#34; was made by Rev. Carlos Slafter.

<p>Within a few decades of the turnpikes&#39; arrival railroad beds were laid through Dedham.  The railroad was at first &#34;considered dangerous.  It was new fangled.  People didn’t trust it, so they wouldn’t ride it.  Only a very few brave souls in those opening years&#34; ever boarded one.  This fear was short lived, however as the first rail line came in 1836 and by 1842 locomotives had put the stagecoach lines out of business.<sup id="_ref-Hanson_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hanson" title="">[7]</a></sup>  The first line was a branch connecting Dedham Square to the main Boston-Providence line in <a href="/wiki/Readville" id="w">Readville</a>.

<p>In 1881 the <a href="/wiki/Boston_and_Providence_Railroad" id="w">Boston and Providence Railroad</a> company built a station in Dedham Square out of Dedham Granite.  There were more than 60 trains a day running to it in its heyday, but it was demolished in 1951 and the stones were used to build the main branch of the Dedham Public Library.<sup id="_ref-stories_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stories" title="">[2]</a></sup>  In 1886 the railroad built a new bridge over High Street and placed a granite plaque there to commemorate both the new bridge and the 250th anniversary of the town&#39;s incorporation.  The plaque was removed sometime thereafter and ended up in the woods near railroad tracks in <a href="/wiki/Sharon%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Sharon</a>.

<p>Nathaniel Whiting arrived in Dedham in 1641 and over the course of the next 182 years he and his descendants owned mills along Mother Brook and a great swath of farmland.  In 1871 William Whiting, the last member of the family to own a mill, sold the remainder of the family farm and Charles Sanderson began laying it out in a subdevelopment to become known as Oakdale.<sup id="_ref-Palma_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Palma" title="">[28]</a></sup>  Today, Whiting Ave is home to both the High School and the Middle School, and Sanderson Street runs into Oakdale Square.</p>
<p>The following year the Farrington farm was laid out into house plots and became the Endicott neighborhood, and in 1873 the Whiting/ Turner tract of land was developed into Ashcroft.  By 1910 the area on the opposite side of the Charles River began to be developed.  It was once know as Dedham Island or Cow Island, as the Long Ditch connected the river in two spots and bypassed the &#39;great bend.&#39;  Today, the neighborhood is known as Riverdale.  The Sprauge farm by the Neponset River became known as the Manor and in the last major development of town, the Smith Farm became the neighborhood of Greenlodge.<sup id="_ref-DHS Capsule_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DHS Capsule" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Thatcher was the minister in Dedham&#39;s third parish, however, and could not officiate outside of the town&#39;s borders.  To resolve this dilemma the couple stood on the Walpole side of Bubbling Brook, and Thatcher stood on the Dedham side.

<p>In 1843, 85 years after the Acadians arrived, the first Catholic Mass was said in Daniel Slattery&#39;s home where the police station now stands in Dedham Square.  For the next three years after that first Mass with eight Catholics present, John Dagget, Slattery&#39;s brother in law, would drive to <a href="/wiki/Waltham%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Waltham</a> each Sunday and bring Father James Strain to Dedham to say Mass.

<p>It was also in 1880 that the Town Meeting set aside of the town cemetery, Brookdale, for Catholics to be buried in.  The following year two Protestant businessmen gave great financial support to the fledgling parish.  John R. Bullard contributed the Dedham granite used to construct the great upper church.  Albert W.

<p>In 1900, the same year St. Mary&#39;s was dedicated,  a talented young lawyer from Boston bought a home with his new wife at 194 Village Avenue.  Sixteen years later <a href="/wiki/Louis_D._Brandeis" id="w">Louis D.

Brandeis was a member of the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.dedhamclub.org" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.dedhamclub.org">Dedham Country and Polo Club</a> and the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.dedhamhistorical.org" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.dedhamhistorical.org">Dedham Historical Society</a><sup id="_ref-Brandeis_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brandeis" title="">[46]</a></sup> as well as a member of the <a href="/wiki/The_Society_in_Dedham_for_Apprehending_Horse_Thieves" id="w">the Society in Dedham for Apprehending Horse Thieves</a>.<sup id="_ref-Horse_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Horse" title="">[11]</a></sup>  He wrote to his brother of the town saying: &#34;Dedham is a spring of eternal youth for me. I feel newly made and ready to deny the existence of these grey hairs.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Brandeis_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brandeis" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1904 the home of Henry Bradford Endicott, the founder of the multimillion dollar  Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company<sup id="_ref-jjr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jjr" title="">[47]</a></sup> had his home on East Street burn to the ground.  The fire department was not able to get to the estate in time as they were dealing with three other fires simultaneously,<sup id="_ref-endicott_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-endicott" title="">[48]</a></sup> including one at the fire house.<sup id="_ref-stories_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stories" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Henry cleared the ashes away and built a new homestead on the 15 acre parcel.<sup id="_ref-endicott_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-endicott" title="">[48]</a></sup>  The three story building he constructed has nine bathrooms, eight bedrooms, a library, a music room, a ballroom, a mirrored parlor, a butler&#39;s kitchen, a linen room, and servants&#39; quarters.<sup id="_ref-globe estate_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-globe estate" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>When he died in 1920 he left the building to his stepdaughter Katherine.

It soon became apparent that it would be cheaper to build a brand new mansion than to remodel the estate to Volpe&#39;s wife&#39;s &#34;lavish taste&#34; and &#34;crazy notions&#34; than to renovate the Endicott Estate and<sup id="_ref-mansion_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mansion" title="">[50]</a></sup> in 1969 the Commonwealth gave the estate back to the Town.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>In 1922 the <a href="/wiki/Noble_and_Greenough_School" id="w">Noble and Greenough School</a> moved from Boston to Dedham.

<p>The 1960s brought a number of events to Dedham that, like the building of the Fairbanks House, may not have seemed important at the time have proved to be major events.

<p>The historic <a href="/wiki/Sacco_and_Vanzetti" id="w">Sacco and Vanzetti</a> trial was held in the Dedham Courthouse in 1921 under heavy police guard.<sup id="_ref-linder_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-linder" title="">[57]</a></sup>  The two were Italian-born American anarchists, who were arrested, tried, and executed for the killings of Frederick Parmenter, a shoe factory paymaster, and Alessandro Berardelli, a security guard, and for the robbery of $15,766.51 from the factory&#39;s payroll on April 15, 1920.<sup id="_ref-pasco_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pasco" title="">[58]</a></sup>  Many believe that they &#34;were the innocent victims of political and economic interests determined to  send a message about the rising tide of anarchist violence.&#34;<sup id="_ref-linder_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-linder" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>The trial opened on May 31, 1921 with heavy security.  Police were stationed at every entrance of the courthouse and all those entering were searched for weapons.  The State Constabulary patrolled outside on horseback and motorcycles<sup id="_ref-linder_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-linder" title="">[57]</a></sup> and the courtroom was retrofitted with bomb shutters and sliding steel doors that could seal off that wing of the courthouse in case of an attack.  The cast iron shutters on the windows were designed and painted to match the wooden ones on the rest of the building.    The courtroom was so protected that &#34;the trial would be conducted in a far more formidable cage than the simple prisoner&#39;s cage that surrounded Sacco and Vanzetti during their trial.&#34;<sup id="_ref-d'attilio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-d'attilio" title="">[59]</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The motion was denied by Judge <a href="/wiki/Webster_Thayer" id="w">Webster Thayer</a> in October and in the next 10 months the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Supreme_Judicial_Court" id="w">Supreme Judicial Court</a>, a federal judge and three Supreme Court Justices, including Brandeis, each denied motions for either a new trial or a stay of execution.  On August 23, 1927 the two were electrocuted in the Charlestown jail.
