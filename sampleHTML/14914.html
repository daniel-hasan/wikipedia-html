The <b>Industrial Revolution</b> was a period in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation had a profound effect on <a href="/wiki/Socioeconomics" id="w">socioeconomic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cultural" id="w">cultural</a> conditions in <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">Britain</a> and subsequently spread throughout Europe and North America and eventually the world, a process that continues as <a href="/wiki/Industrialisation" id="w">industrialisation</a>. The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human social history, comparable to <a href="/wiki/Neolithic_revolution" id="w">the invention of farming</a> or <a href="/wiki/Civilisation#Development of early civilizations" id="w">the rise of the first city-states</a>;
almost every aspect of daily life and human society was eventually influenced in some way.</p>
<p>In the later part of the 1700s the manual labour based economy of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain" id="w">Kingdom of Great Britain</a> began to be replaced by one dominated by industry and the manufacture of <a href="/wiki/Machine" id="w">machinery</a>. It started with the mechanisation of the <a href="/wiki/Textile" id="w">textile</a> industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of refined coal. Once started it spread. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Canal" id="w">canals</a>, improved roads and <a href="/wiki/Rail_transport" id="w">railways</a>. The introduction of <a href="/wiki/Steam_engine" id="w">steam power</a> (fuelled primarily by coal) and powered machinery (mainly in <a href="/wiki/Textile_manufacturing" id="w">textile manufacturing</a>) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The development of all-metal <a href="/wiki/Machine_tool" id="w">machine tools</a> in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries.  The effects spread throughout <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe" id="w">Western Europe</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a> during the 19th century, eventually affecting most of the world. The impact of this change on society was enormous.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first Industrial Revolution merged into the <a href="/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution" id="w">Second Industrial Revolution</a> around 1850, when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam-powered <a href="/wiki/Ship" id="w">ships</a>, railways, and later in the nineteenth century with the <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" id="w">internal combustion engine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electric_power" id="w">electrical power generation</a>.</p>
<p>The period of time covered by the Industrial Revolution varies with different historians. <a href="/wiki/Eric_Hobsbawm" id="w">Eric Hobsbawm</a> held that it &#39;broke out&#39; in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> while <a href="/wiki/T._S._Ashton" id="w">T. S. Ashton</a> held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>
Some twentieth century historians such as <a href="/wiki/John_Clapham" id="w">John Clapham</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Crafts" id="w">Nicholas Crafts</a> have argued that the process of economic and social change took place gradually and the term <i><a href="/wiki/Revolution" id="w">revolution</a></i> is not a true description of what took place. This is still a subject of debate amongst historians.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate, with some historians feeling the Revolution as an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of <a href="/wiki/Feudalism" id="w">feudalism</a> in Britain after the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" id="w">English Civil War</a> in the 17th century. As national border controls became more effective, the spread of disease was lessened, therefore preventing the epidemics common in previous times. The percentage of children who lived past infancy rose significantly, leading to a larger workforce. The <a href="/wiki/Enclosure" id="w">Enclosure</a> movement and the <a href="/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution" id="w">British Agricultural Revolution</a> made food production more efficient and less labour-intensive, forcing the surplus population who could no longer find employment in agriculture into <a href="/wiki/Cottage_industry" id="w">cottage industry</a>, for example <a href="/wiki/Weaving" id="w">weaving</a>, and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed <a href="/wiki/Factories" id="w">factories</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Colonial_expansion" id="w">colonial expansion</a> of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of <a href="/wiki/Financial_markets" id="w">financial markets</a> and accumulation of <a href="/wiki/Capital_(economics)" id="w">capital</a> are also cited as factors, as is the <a href="/wiki/Scientific_revolution" id="w">scientific revolution</a> of the 17th century.</p>
<p>Technological innovation was the heart of the industrial revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the <a href="/wiki/Steam_engine" id="w">steam engine</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The historian, <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Mumford" id="w">Lewis Mumford</a> has proposed that the Industrial Revolution had its origins in the early <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a>, much earlier than most estimates. He explains that the model for standardised <a href="/wiki/Mass_production" id="w">mass production</a> was the <a href="/wiki/Printing_press" id="w">printing press</a> and that &#34;the archetypal model for the [industrial era] was the clock&#34;. He also cites the <a href="/wiki/Monastic" id="w">monastic</a> emphasis on order and time-keeping, as well as the fact that <a href="/wiki/Mediaeval" id="w">Mediaeval</a> cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later, more physical manifestations such as the steam engine.</p>
<p>The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain. In other nations, such as France, markets were split up by local regions, which often imposed tolls and <a href="/wiki/Tariff" id="w">tariffs</a> on goods traded amongst them.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Governments&#39; grant of limited <a href="/wiki/Monopoly" id="w">monopolies</a> to inventors under a developing <a href="/wiki/Patent" id="w">patent</a> system (the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Monopolies_1623" id="w">Statute of Monopolies 1623</a>) is considered an influential factor. The effects of patents, both good and ill, on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine, the key enabling technology. In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewards inventors by allowing, e.g, <a href="/wiki/James_Watt" id="w">James Watt</a> to monopolise the production of the first steam engines, thereby enabling inventors and increasing the pace of technological development. However, monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial effects of publicizing ingenuity and rewarding inventors.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Watt&#39;s monopoly may have prevented other inventors, such as <a href="/wiki/Richard_Trevithick" id="w">Richard Trevithick</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Murdoch" id="w">William Murdoch</a> or <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Hornblower" id="w">Jonathan Hornblower</a>, from introducing improved steam engines thereby retarding the industrial revolution by up to 20 years<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>.</p>

One question of active interest to historians is why the industrial revolution occurred in Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century, particularly <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/India_(disambiguation)" id="w">India</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" id="w">Middle East</a>, or at other times like in <a href="/wiki/Classical_Antiquity" id="w">Classical Antiquity</a><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> or the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Numerous factors have been suggested, including ecology, government, and culture.</p>
<p>Benjamin Elman argues that China was in a <a href="/wiki/High_level_equilibrium_trap" id="w">high level equilibrium trap</a> in which the non-industrial methods were efficient enough to prevent use of industrial methods with high costs of capital. <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Pomeranz" id="w">Kenneth Pomeranz</a>, in the <i>Great Divergence</i>, argues that Europe and China were remarkably similar in 1700, and that the crucial differences which created the Industrial Revolution in Europe were sources of coal near manufacturing centres, and raw materials such as food and wood from the <a href="/wiki/New_World" id="w">New World</a>, which allowed Europe to expand economically in a way that China could not.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, most historians contest the assertion that Europe and China were roughly equal because modern estimates of per capita income on Western Europe in the late 18th century are of roughly 1,500 dollars in <a href="/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity" id="w">purchasing power parity</a> (and Britain had a <a href="/wiki/Per_capita_income" id="w">per capita income</a> of nearly 2,000 dollars<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>) whereas China, by comparison, had only 450 dollars. Also, the average <a href="/wiki/Interest_rate" id="w">interest rate</a> was about 5% in Britain and over 30% in China, which illustrates how capital was much more abundant in Britain; capital that was available for investment.</p>
<p>Some historians such as <a href="/wiki/David_Landes" id="w">David Landes</a><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Max_Weber" id="w">Max Weber</a> credit the different belief systems in China and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred. The religion and beliefs of Europe were largely products of <a href="/wiki/Judaeo-Christianity" id="w">Judaeo-Christianity</a>, and Greek thought. Conversely, Chinese society was founded on men like <a href="/wiki/Confucius" id="w">Confucius</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mencius" id="w">Mencius</a>, <a href="/wiki/Han_Feizi" id="w">Han Feizi</a> (<a href="/wiki/Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)" id="w">Legalism</a>), <a href="/wiki/Lao_Tzu" id="w">Lao Tzu</a> (<a href="/wiki/Taoism" id="w">Taoism</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Gautama_Buddha" id="w">Buddha</a> (<a href="/wiki/Buddhism" id="w">Buddhism</a>). The key difference between these belief systems was that those from Europe focused on the individual, while Chinese beliefs centred around relationships between people. The family unit was more important than the individual for the large majority of Chinese history, and this may have played a role in why the Industrial Revolution took much longer to occur in China. There was the additional difference as to whether people looked backwards to a reputedly glorious past for answers to their questions or looked hopefully to the future. Furthermore, Western European peoples had experienced the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" id="w">Renaissance</a>, <a href="/wiki/Reformation" id="w">Reformation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" id="w">Enlightenment</a>; other parts of the world had not had a similar intellectual breakout, a condition that holds true even into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Regarding <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>, the Marxist historian <a href="/wiki/Rajani_Palme_Dutt" id="w">Rajani Palme Dutt</a> said: &#34;The capital to finance the Industrial Revolution in India instead went into financing the Industrial Revolution in England.&#34;<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> In contrast to China, India was split up into many competing kingdoms, with the three major ones being the <a href="/wiki/Marathas" id="w">Marathas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sikhs" id="w">Sikhs</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Mughals" id="w">Mughals</a>. In addition, the economy was highly dependent on two sectors&#8212;agriculture of subsistence and cotton, and technical innovation was non-existent. The vast amounts of wealth were stored away in palace treasuries, and as such, were easily moved to Britain.</p>
<a id="Causes_for_occurrence_in_Britain" name="Causes_for_occurrence_in_Britain"></a><h2>Causes for occurrence in Britain</h2>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">As the Industrial Revolution developed British manufactured output surged ahead of other economies</div></div>
</p>
<p>The debate about the start of the Industrial Revolution also concerns the massive lead that <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">Great Britain</a> had over other countries. Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas <a href="/wiki/British_Empire#Colonization" id="w">colonies</a> or that profits from the British <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade" id="w">slave trade</a> between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. It has been pointed out, however, that slavery provided only 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Alternatively, the greater liberalisation of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed Britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies, particularly China and Russia. Britain emerged from the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" id="w">Napoleonic Wars</a> as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse, and possessing the only merchant fleet of any useful size (European merchant fleets having been destroyed during the war by the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" id="w">Royal Navy</a><sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>). Britain&#39;s extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods. The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe. This was further aided by Britain&#39;s geographical position &#8212; an island separated from the rest of mainland Europe.</p>
<p>Another theory is that Britain was able to succeed in the Industrial Revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed. It had a dense population for its small geographical size. <a href="/wiki/Enclosure" id="w">Enclosure</a> of common land and the related <a href="/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution" id="w">Agricultural Revolution</a> made a supply of this labour readily available. There was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the <a href="/wiki/Northern_England" id="w">North of England</a>, the English <a href="/wiki/Midlands" id="w">Midlands</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_Wales" id="w">South Wales</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Lowlands" id="w">Scottish Lowlands</a>. Local supplies of coal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone and water power, resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry. Also, the damp, mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton, providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry.</p>
<p>The stable political situation in Britain from around 1688, and British society&#39;s greater receptiveness to change (compared with other European countries) can also be said to be factors favouring the Industrial Revolution. In large part due to the Enclosure movement, the peasantry was destroyed as significant source of resistance to industrialisation, and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>  (This point is also made in <a href="/wiki/Hilaire_Belloc" id="w">Hilaire Belloc</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/The_Servile_State" id="w">The Servile State</a>.)</p>
<a id="Protestant_work_ethic" name="Protestant_work_ethic"></a><h4>Protestant work ethic</h4>
<p>Another theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an <a href="/wiki/Entrepreneur" id="w">entrepreneurial</a> class which believed in progress, technology and hard work.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>
The existence of this class is often linked to the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic" id="w">Protestant work ethic</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Max_Weber" id="w">Max Weber</a>) and the particular status of dissenting Protestant sects, such as the <a href="/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends" id="w">Quakers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Baptists" id="w">Baptists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Presbyterians" id="w">Presbyterians</a> that had flourished with the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" id="w">English Civil War</a>. Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law, which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Britain in the <a href="/wiki/Glorious_Revolution" id="w">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1688, and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the <a href="/wiki/National_debt" id="w">national debt</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_England" id="w">Bank of England</a>, contributed to the capacity for, and interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/English_Dissenters" id="w">Dissenters</a> found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices, as well as education at England&#39;s only two universities at the time (although dissenters were still free to study at Scotland&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ancient_universities_of_Scotland" id="w">four universities</a>). When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official <a href="/wiki/Anglican_church" id="w">Anglican church</a> became mandatory due to the <a href="/wiki/Test_Act" id="w">Test Act</a>, they thereupon became active in banking, manufacturing and education. The <a href="/wiki/Unitarians" id="w">Unitarians</a>, in particular, were very involved in education, by running Dissenting Academies, where, in contrast to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow, much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences &#8212;areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies.</p>
<p>Historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important, along with the nature of the national economies involved. While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were considered fellow Protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_class" id="w">middle class</a>, such as traditional financiers or other businessmen. Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the <a href="/wiki/Scientific_revolution" id="w">Scientific revolution</a> of the 17th century.</p>
<a id="Innovations" name="Innovations"></a><h1>Innovations</h1>

<p>The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations, made in the second half of the 18th century:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Textiles</b> - <a href="/wiki/Cotton" id="w">Cotton</a> <a href="/wiki/Spinning_(textiles)" id="w">spinning</a> using <a href="/wiki/Richard_Arkwright" id="w">Richard Arkwright</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Water_frame" id="w">water frame</a>, James Hargreaves&#39;s Spinning Jenny, and Samuel Crompton&#39;s Spinning Mule (a combination of the Spinning Jenny and the Water Frame). This was patented in 1769 and so came out of patent in 1783. The end of the patent was rapidly followed by the erection of many <a href="/wiki/Cotton_mill" id="w">cotton mills</a>. Similar technology was subsequently applied to spinning <a href="/wiki/Worsted" id="w">worsted</a> <a href="/wiki/Yarn" id="w">yarn</a> for various textiles and <a href="/wiki/Flax" id="w">flax</a> for <a href="/wiki/Linen" id="w">linen</a>.</li>
<li><b>Steam power</b> - The improved <a href="/wiki/Steam_engine" id="w">steam engine</a> invented by <a href="/wiki/James_Watt" id="w">James Watt</a> was initially mainly used for pumping out <a href="/wiki/Mining" id="w">mines</a>, but from the 1780s was applied to power machines. This enabled rapid development of efficient semi-automated factories on a previously unimaginable scale in places where <a href="/wiki/Waterpower" id="w">waterpower</a> was not available.</li>
<li><b>Iron founding</b> - In the <a href="/wiki/Ironworks" id="w">Iron industry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coke_(fuel)" id="w">coke</a> was finally applied to all stages of iron <a href="/wiki/Smelting" id="w">smelting</a>, replacing <a href="/wiki/Charcoal" id="w">charcoal</a>. This had been achieved much earlier for <a href="/wiki/Lead" id="w">lead</a> and <a href="/wiki/Copper" id="w">copper</a> as well as for producing <a href="/wiki/Pig_iron" id="w">pig iron</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Blast_furnace" id="w">blast furnace</a>, but the second stage in the production of <a href="/wiki/Wrought_iron" id="w">bar iron</a> depended on the use of <a href="/wiki/Potting_and_stamping" id="w">potting and stamping</a> (for which a <a href="/wiki/Patent" id="w">patent</a> expired in 1786) or <a href="/wiki/Puddling_furnace" id="w">puddling</a> (patented by <a href="/wiki/Henry_Cort" id="w">Henry Cort</a> in 1783 and 1784.</li></ul> 
<p>These represent three &#39;leading sectors&#39;, in which there were key innovations, which allowed the economic take off by which the Industrial Revolution is usually defined. This is not to belittle many other inventions, particularly in the <a href="/wiki/Textile" id="w">textile</a> industry. Without some earlier ones, such as <a href="/wiki/Spinning_jenny" id="w">spinning jenny</a> and <a href="/wiki/Flying_shuttle" id="w">flying shuttle</a> in the textile industry and the smelting of pig iron with coke, these achievements might have been impossible. Later inventions such as the power <a href="/wiki/Loom" id="w">loom</a> and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Trevithick" id="w">Richard Trevithick</a>&#39;s high pressure <a href="/wiki/Steam_engine" id="w">steam engine</a> were also important in the growing industrialisation of Britain. The application of steam engines to powering <a href="/wiki/Cotton_mill" id="w">cotton mills</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ironworks" id="w">ironworks</a> enabled these to be built in places that were most convenient because other resources were available, rather than where there was water to power a <a href="/wiki/Mill" id="w">mill</a>.</p>
<p>In the textile sector, such mills became the model for the organisation of human labour in factories, epitomised by <a href="/wiki/Cottonopolis" id="w">Cottonopolis</a>, the name given to the vast collection of <a href="/wiki/Cotton_mill" id="w">cotton mills</a>, <a href="/wiki/Factories" id="w">factories</a> and administration offices based in <a href="/wiki/Manchester" id="w">Manchester</a>. The assembly line system greatly improved efficiency, both in this and other industries. With a series of men trained to do a single task on a product, then having it moved along to the next worker, the number of finished goods also rose significantly.</p>
<a id="Transfer_of_knowledge" name="Transfer_of_knowledge"></a><h2>Transfer of knowledge</h2>
<p>Knowledge of new innovation was spread by several means. Workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached. A common method was for someone to make a study tour, gathering information where he could. During the whole of the Industrial Revolution and for the century before, all European countries and America engaged in study-touring; some nations, like <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Sweden</a> and <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy. In other countries, notably Britain and America, this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers anxious to improve their own methods. Study tours were common then, as now, as was the keeping of travel diaries. Records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods.</p>

Another means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies, like the <a href="/wiki/Lunar_Society" id="w">Lunar Society</a> of <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" id="w">Birmingham</a>, in which members met to discuss &#39;natural philosophy&#39; (<i>i.e.</i> science) and often its application to manufacturing. The Lunar Society flourished from 1765 to 1809, and it has been said of them, &#34;They were, if you like, the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions, the Industrial Revolution&#34;.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions. For example, the London-based <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Arts" id="w">Royal Society of Arts</a> published an illustrated volume of new inventions, as well as papers about them in its annual <i>Transactions</i>.</p>
<p>There were publications describing technology. <a href="/wiki/Encyclopaedia" id="w">Encyclopaedias</a> such as Harris&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Lexicon_technicum" id="w">Lexicon technicum</a></i> (1704) and Dr Abraham Rees&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Cyclopaedia" id="w">Cyclopaedia</a></i> (1802-1819) contain much of value. <i>Cyclopaedia</i> contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the Industrial Revolution, very well illustrated by fine engravings. Foreign printed sources such as the <i><a href="/wiki/Descriptions_des_Arts_et_M%C3%A9tiers" id="w">Descriptions des Arts et Métiers</a></i> and Diderot&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A9die" id="w">Encyclopédie</a></i> explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates.</p>
<p>Periodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the 18th century, and many regularly included notice of the latest patents. Foreign periodicals, such as the <a href="/wiki/Annales_des_Mines" id="w">Annales des Mines</a>, published accounts of travels made by French engineers who observed British methods on study tours.</p>

</p>
<p>In the early 18th century, British textile manufacture was based on <a href="/wiki/Wool" id="w">wool</a> which was processed by individual <a href="/wiki/Artisan" id="w">artisans</a>, doing the <a href="/wiki/Spinning_(textiles)" id="w">spinning</a> and <a href="/wiki/Weaving" id="w">weaving</a> on their own premises. This system is called a <a href="/wiki/Cottage_industry" id="w">cottage industry</a>. <a href="/wiki/Flax" id="w">Flax</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cotton" id="w">cotton</a> were also used for fine materials, but the processing was difficult because of the pre-processing needed, and thus goods in these materials made only a small proportion of the output.</p>
<p>Use of the <a href="/wiki/Spinning_wheel" id="w">spinning wheel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Loom" id="w">hand loom</a> restricted the production capacity of the industry, but incremental advances increased productivity to the extent that manufactured cotton goods became the dominant British export by the early decades of the 19th century. <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> was displaced as the premier supplier of cotton goods.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Lewis_Paul" id="w">Lewis Paul</a> patented the Roller Spinning machine and the <a href="/wiki/Flyer-and-bobbin" id="w">flyer-and-bobbin</a> system for drawing wool to a more even thickness, developed with the help of John Wyatt in <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" id="w">Birmingham</a>. Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a <a href="/wiki/Donkey" id="w">donkey</a>. In 1743, a factory was opened in <a href="/wiki/Northampton" id="w">Northampton</a> with fifty spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt&#39;s machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Bourn" id="w">Daniel Bourn</a> in <a href="/wiki/Leominster" id="w">Leominster</a>, but this burnt down.   Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourne patented <a href="/wiki/Carding" id="w">carding</a> machines in 1748. Using two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first cotton spinning <a href="/wiki/Cotton_mill" id="w">mill</a>. Lewis&#39;s invention was later developed and improved by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Arkwright" id="w">Richard Arkwright</a> in his <a href="/wiki/Water_frame" id="w">water frame</a> and <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Crompton" id="w">Samuel Crompton</a> in his <a href="/wiki/Spinning_mule" id="w">spinning mule</a>.  </p>
<p>Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling) so that the supply of <a href="/wiki/Yarn" id="w">yarn</a> increased greatly, which fed a weaving industry that was advancing with improvements to <a href="/wiki/Shuttle_(weaving)" id="w">shuttles</a> and the loom or &#39;frame&#39;. The output of an individual labourer increased dramatically, with the effect that the new machines were seen as a threat to employment, and early innovators were attacked and their inventions destroyed.</p>
<p>To capitalise upon these advances, it took a class of <a href="/wiki/Entrepreneur" id="w">entrepreneurs</a>, of which the most famous is <a href="/wiki/Richard_Arkwright" id="w">Richard Arkwright</a>. He is credited with a list of inventions, but these were actually developed by people such as <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Highs" id="w">Thomas Highs</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Kay_(Spinning_Frame)" id="w">John Kay</a>; Arkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. He created the <a href="/wiki/Cotton_mill" id="w">cotton mill</a> which brought the production processes together in a factory, and he developed the use of power &#8212; first <a href="/wiki/Horse_power" id="w">horse power</a> and then <a href="/wiki/Water_power" id="w">water power</a> &#8212; which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry.

</p>
<p>The major change in the metal industries during the era of the Industrial Revolution was the replacement of organic fuels based on <a href="/wiki/Wood" id="w">wood</a> with <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" id="w">fossil fuel</a> based on coal. Much of this happened somewhat before the Industrial Revolution, based on innovations by Sir <a href="/wiki/Clement_Clerke" id="w">Clement Clerke</a> and others from 1678, using coal <a href="/wiki/Reverberatory_furnace" id="w">reverberatory furnaces</a> known as cupolas. These were operated by the flames, which contained <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" id="w">carbon monoxide</a>, playing on the <a href="/wiki/Ore" id="w">ore</a> and <a href="/wiki/Redox" id="w">reducing</a> the <a href="/wiki/Oxide" id="w">oxide</a> to metal. This has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to <a href="/wiki/Lead" id="w">lead</a> from 1678 and to <a href="/wiki/Copper" id="w">copper</a> from 1687. It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace. The foundry cupola is a different (and later) innovation.</p>
<p>This was followed by <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Darby_I" id="w">Abraham Darby</a>, who made great strides using coke to fuel his <a href="/wiki/Blast_furnace" id="w">blast furnaces</a> at <a href="/wiki/Coalbrookdale" id="w">Coalbrookdale</a> in 1709. However, the coke <a href="/wiki/Pig_iron" id="w">pig iron</a> he made was used mostly for the production of cast iron goods such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs. Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce bar iron in forges until the mid 1750s, when his son <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Darby_II" id="w">Abraham Darby II</a> built <a href="/wiki/Horsehay" id="w">Horsehay</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ketley" id="w">Ketley</a> furnaces (not far from Coalbrookdale). By then, coke pig iron was cheaper than charcoal pig iron.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Bar_iron" id="w">Bar iron</a> for smiths to forge into consumer goods was still made in <a href="/wiki/Finery_forge" id="w">finery forges</a>, as it long had been. However, new processes were adopted in the ensuing years. The first is referred to today as <a href="/wiki/Potting_and_stamping" id="w">potting and stamping</a>, but this was superseded by <a href="/wiki/Henry_Cort" id="w">Henry Cort</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Puddling_furnace" id="w">puddling</a> process. From 1785, perhaps because the improved version of potting and stamping was about to come out of patent, a great expansion in the output of the British iron industry began. The new processes did not depend on the use of <a href="/wiki/Charcoal" id="w">charcoal</a> at all and were therefore not limited by charcoal sources.</p>
<p>Up to that time, British iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of imported iron to supplement native supplies. This came principally from <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Sweden</a> from the mid 17th century and later also from <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a> from the end of the 1720s. However, from 1785, imports decreased because of the new iron making technology, and Britain became an exporter of bar iron as well as manufactured <a href="/wiki/Wrought_iron" id="w">wrought iron</a> <a href="/wiki/Consumer_goods" id="w">consumer goods</a>.</p>
<p>Since iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it also became a major structural material following the building of the innovative <a href="/wiki/Iron_Bridge" id="w">Iron Bridge</a> in 1778 by <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Darby_III" id="w">Abraham Darby III</a>.</p>
<p>An improvement was made in the production of <a href="/wiki/Steel" id="w">steel</a>, which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for the cutting edge of tools and for springs. <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Huntsman" id="w">Benjamin Huntsman</a> developed his <a href="/wiki/Crucible_steel" id="w">crucible steel</a> technique in the 1740s. The raw material for this was blister steel, made by the <a href="/wiki/Cementation_process" id="w">cementation process</a>.</p>
<p>The supply of cheaper iron and steel aided the development of boilers and steam engines, and eventually railways. Improvements in <a href="/wiki/Machine_tool" id="w">machine tools</a> allowed better working of iron and steel and further boosted the industrial growth of Britain.</p>
<a id="Mining" name="Mining"></a><h4>Mining</h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/History_of_coal_mining" id="w">Coal mining</a> in Britain, particularly in <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_Wales" id="w">South Wales</a> started early. Before the steam engine, <a href="/wiki/Open-pit_mine" id="w">pits</a> were often shallow bell pits following a seam of coal along the surface which were abandoned as the coal was extracted. In other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined by means of an <a href="/wiki/Adit" id="w">adit</a> driven into the side of a hill. <a href="/wiki/Shaft_mining" id="w">Shaft mining</a> was done in some areas, but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water. It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a <a href="/wiki/Sough" id="w">sough</a> (a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine). In either case, the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity. The introduction of the steam engine greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution, but the adoption of James Watt&#39;s more efficient steam engine from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Newcomen&#39;s steam powered atmospheric engine was the first practical engine. Subsequent steam engines were to power the Industrial Revolution</div></div>
</p>
<p>The development of the <a href="/wiki/Stationary_steam_engine" id="w">stationary steam engine</a> was an essential early element of the Industrial Revolution; however, for most of the period of the Industrial Revolution, the majority of industries still relied on wind and water power as well as horse and man-power for driving small machines.</p>
<p>The first real attempt at industrial use of steam power was due to <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Savery" id="w">Thomas Savery</a> in 1698. He constructed and patented in London an a low-lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump, that generated about one <a href="/wiki/Horsepower" id="w">horsepower</a> (hp) and was used as in numerous water works and tried in a few mines (hence its &#34;brand name&#34;, <i>The miner&#39;s Friend</i>), but it was not a success since it was limited in pumping height and prone to boiler explosions.</p>
<p>The first safe and successful steam power plant was introduced by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Newcomen" id="w">Thomas Newcomen</a> from 1712. Newcomen apparently conceived his machine quite independently of Savery, but as the latter had taken out a very wide-ranging patent, Newcomen and his associates were obliged to come to an arrangement with him, marketing the engine until 1733 under a joint patent.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Newcomen&#39;s engine appears to have been based on <a href="/wiki/Denis_Papin" id="w">Papin&#39;s</a> experiments carried out 30 years earlier, and employed a piston and cylinder, one end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston. Steam just above atmospheric pressure (all that the boiler could stand) was introduced into the lower half of the cylinder beneath the piston during the gravity-induced upstroke; the steam was then condensed by a jet of cold water injected into the steam space to produce a partial vacuum; the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the vacuum on either side of the piston displaced it downwards into the cylinder, raising the opposite end of a rocking beam to which was attached a gang of gravity-actuated reciprocating force pumps housed in the mineshaft. The engine&#39;s downward power stroke raised the pump, priming it and preparing the pumping stroke. At first the phases were controlled by hand, but within ten years an escapement mechanism had been devised worked by of a vertical <i>plug tree</i> suspended from the rocking beam which rendered the engine self-acting.</p>
<p>A number of Newcomen engines were successfully put to use in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines, requiring a lot of capital to build, and produced about 5 hp. They were extremely inefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. Despite their disadvantages, Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the nineteenth century. By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread to France, <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hungary" id="w">Hungary</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Sweden</a>. A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14 were abroad. In the 1770s, the engineer <a href="/wiki/John_Smeaton" id="w">John Smeaton</a> built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800.</p>
<p>A fundamental change in working principles was brought about by <a href="/wiki/James_Watt" id="w">James Watt</a>. With the close collaboration <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Boulton" id="w">Matthew Boulton</a>, he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his <a href="/wiki/Watt_steam_engine" id="w">steam engine</a>, which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder thereby making the low pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber. All this meant that a more constant temperature could be maintained in the cylinder and that engine efficiency no longer varied according to atmospheric conditions. These improvements increased engine efficiency by a factor of about five, saving 75% on coal costs. </p>
<p>Nor could the atmospheric engine be easily adapted to drive a rotating wheel, although Wasborough and Pickard did succeed in doing so towards 1780. However by 1783 the more economical Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a double-acting rotative type, which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill. Both of Watt&#39;s basic engine types were commercially very successful, and by 1800, the firm <a href="/wiki/Boulton_%26amp%3B_Watt" id="w">Boulton &#38; Watt</a> had constructed 496 engines, with 164 driving reciprocating pumps, 24 serving <a href="/wiki/Blast_furnace" id="w">blast furnaces</a>, and 308 powering mill machinery; most of the engines generated from 5 to 10 hp.</p>
<p>The development of <a href="/wiki/Machine_tools" id="w">machine tools</a>, such as the lathe, planing and shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines.</p>
<p>Until about 1800, the most common pattern of steam engine was the <a href="/wiki/Beam_engine" id="w">beam engine</a>, built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained portative engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the <a href="/wiki/Table_engine" id="w">table engine</a>. Towards the turn of the 19th Century, the Cornish engineer <a href="/wiki/Richard_Trevithick" id="w">Richard Trevithick</a>, and the American, <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Evans" id="w">Oliver Evans</a>  began to construct higher pressure non-condensing steam engines, exhausting against the atmosphere. This allowed an engine and boiler to be combined into a single unit compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail <a href="/wiki/Locomotive" id="w">locomotives</a> and <a href="/wiki/Steamboat" id="w">steam boats</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 19th century after the expiration of Watt&#39;s patent, the steam engine underwent many improvements by a host of inventors and engineers.</p>

The large scale production of chemicals was an important development during the Industrial Revolution. The first of these was the production of <a href="/wiki/Sulphuric_acid" id="w">sulphuric acid</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Lead_chamber_process" id="w">lead chamber process</a> invented by the Englishman <a href="/wiki/John_Roebuck" id="w">John Roebuck</a> (James Watt&#39;s first partner) in 1746. He was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger, less expensive chambers made of riveted sheets of <a href="/wiki/Lead" id="w">lead</a>. Instead of a few pounds at a time, he was able to make a hundred pounds (45 kg) or so at a time in each of the chambers.</p>
<p>The production of an <a href="/wiki/Alkali" id="w">alkali</a> on a large scale became an important goal as well, and <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Leblanc" id="w">Nicolas Leblanc</a> succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the production of <a href="/wiki/Sodium_carbonate" id="w">sodium carbonate</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Leblanc_process" id="w">Leblanc process</a> was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and <a href="/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid" id="w">hydrochloric acid</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Sodium_sulfate" id="w">sodium sulphate</a> was heated with <a href="/wiki/Limestone" id="w">limestone</a> (<a href="/wiki/Calcium_carbonate" id="w">calcium carbonate</a>) and coal to give a mixture of <a href="/wiki/Sodium_carbonate" id="w">sodium carbonate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Calcium_sulfide" id="w">calcium sulphide</a>. Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide. The process produced a large amount of pollution (the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulphide was a useless waste product). Nonetheless, this synthetic <a href="/wiki/Soda_ash" id="w">soda ash</a> proved economical compared to that from burning certain plants (<a href="/wiki/Barilla" id="w">barilla</a>) or from <a href="/wiki/Kelp" id="w">kelp</a>, which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash,<sup id="_ref-Clow52_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Clow52" title="">[26]</a></sup> and also to <a href="/wiki/Potash" id="w">potash</a> (<a href="/wiki/Potassium_carbonate" id="w">potassium carbonate</a>) derived from hardwood ashes.</p>
<p>These two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes. Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass, textile, soap, and paper industries. Early uses for sulphuric acid included pickling (removing rust) iron and steel, and for <a href="/wiki/Bleach" id="w">bleaching</a> cloth.</p>
<p>The development of bleaching powder (<a href="/wiki/Calcium_hypochlorite" id="w">calcium hypochlorite</a>) by Scottish chemist <a href="/wiki/Charles_Tennant" id="w">Charles Tennant</a> in about 1800, based on the discoveries of French chemist <a href="/wiki/Claude_Louis_Berthollet" id="w">Claude Louis Berthollet</a>, revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process then in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk. Tennant&#39;s factory at St Rollox, North <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" id="w">Glasgow</a>, became the largest chemical plant in the world.</p>
<p>In 1824 <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Aspdin" id="w">Joseph Aspdin</a>, a British brick layer turned builder, patented a chemical process for making <a href="/wiki/Portland_cement" id="w">portland cement</a> which was an important advance in the building trades. This process involves <a href="/wiki/Sintering" id="w">sintering</a> a mixture of clay and limestone to about 1400 °C, then grinding it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water, sand and gravel to produce <a href="/wiki/Concrete" id="w">concrete</a>. It was used several years later by the famous English engineer, <a href="/wiki/Marc_Isambard_Brunel" id="w">Marc Isambard Brunel</a>, who used it in the <a href="/wiki/Thames_Tunnel" id="w">Thames Tunnel</a>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup>
Cement was used on a large scale in the construction of the <a href="/wiki/London_sewerage_system" id="w">London sewerage system</a> a generation later.</p>
<a id="Machine_tools" name="Machine_tools"></a><h4>Machine tools</h4>
<p>The Industrial Revolution could not have developed without <a href="/wiki/Machine_tool" id="w">machine tools</a>, for they enabled manufacturing machines to be made. They have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms. The mechanical parts of early textile machines were sometimes called &#39;clock work&#39; because of the metal spindles and gears they incorporated. The manufacture of textile machines drew craftsmen from these trades and is the origin of the modern engineering industry.</p>
<p>Machines were built by various craftsmen&#8212;<a href="/wiki/Carpenter" id="w">carpenters</a> made wooden framings, and smiths and turners made metal parts. A good example of how machine tools changed manufacturing took place in Birmingham, England, in 1830. The invention of a new machine by <a href="/wiki/William_Joseph_Gillott" id="w">William Joseph Gillott</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Mitchell" id="w">William Mitchell</a> and <a href="/wiki/James_Stephen_Perry" id="w">James Stephen Perry</a> allowed mass manufacture of robust, cheap steel pen nibs; the process had been laborious and expensive. Because of the difficulty of manipulating metal and the lack of machine tools, the use of metal was kept to a minimum. Wood framing had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time. As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal frames became more common, but they required machine tools to make them economically. Before the advent of machine tools, metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers, files, scrapers, saws and chisels. Small metal parts were readily made by this means, but for large machine parts, production was very laborious and costly.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">A lathe from 1911. A type of machine tool able to make other machines</div></div>

Apart from workshop <a href="/wiki/Lathe" id="w">lathes</a> used by craftsmen, the first large machine tool was the cylinder <a href="/wiki/Boring_machine" id="w">boring machine</a> used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. The <a href="/wiki/Planing_machine" id="w">planing machine</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Slotting_machine" id="w">slotting machine</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Shaping_machine" id="w">shaping machine</a> were developed in the first decades of the 19th century. Although the <a href="/wiki/Milling_machine" id="w">milling machine</a> was invented at this time, it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until during the Second Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Military production had a hand in the development of machine tools. <a href="/wiki/Henry_Maudslay" id="w">Henry Maudslay</a>, who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was employed at the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Arsenal" id="w">Royal Arsenal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Woolwich" id="w">Woolwich</a>, as a young man where he would have seen the large horse-driven wooden machines for <a href="/wiki/Cannon" id="w">cannon</a> boring made and worked by the <a href="/wiki/Verbruggans" id="w">Verbruggans</a>. He later worked for <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Bramah" id="w">Joseph Bramah</a> on the production of metal locks, and soon after he began working on his own. He was engaged to build the machinery for making ships&#39; pulley blocks for the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" id="w">Royal Navy</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Portsmouth_Block_Mills" id="w">Portsmouth Block Mills</a>. These were all metal and were the first machines for <a href="/wiki/Mass_production" id="w">mass production</a> and making components with a degree of <a href="/wiki/Interchangeability" id="w">interchangeability</a>. The lessons Maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools, and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work, such as <a href="/wiki/Richard_Roberts_(engineer)" id="w">Richard Roberts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Clement" id="w">Joseph Clement</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Whitworth" id="w">Joseph Whitworth</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/James_Fox" id="w">James Fox</a> of <a href="/wiki/Derby" id="w">Derby</a> had a healthy export trade in machine tools for the first third of the century, as did <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Murray" id="w">Matthew Murray</a> of Leeds. Roberts was a maker of high-quality machine tools and a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement.</p>
<a id="Gas_lighting" name="Gas_lighting"></a><h4>Gas lighting</h4>
<p>{{Main}}
Another major industry of the later industrial revolution was <a href="/wiki/Gas_lighting" id="w">gas lighting</a>. Though others made a similar innovation elsewhere, the large scale introduction of this was the work of <a href="/wiki/William_Murdoch" id="w">William Murdoch</a>, an employee of <a href="/wiki/Boulton_and_Watt" id="w">Boulton and Watt</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" id="w">Birmingham</a> <a href="/wiki/Watt_steam_engine" id="w">steam engine</a> pioneers. The process consisted of the large scale gasification of coal in furnaces, the purification of the gas (removal of sulphur, ammonium, and heavy hydrocarbons), and its storage and distribution. The first gaslighting utilities were established in London between 1812-20. They soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the UK. Gaslighting had in impact on social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil. Its introduction allowed night life to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and street could be lighted on a larger scale than before.</p>
<a id="Glass_making" name="Glass_making"></a><h4>Glass making</h4>
<p>A new method of producing glass, known as the cylinder process, was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832, this process was used by the <a href="/wiki/Chance_Brothers" id="w">Chance Brothers</a> to create sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger spans of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings.</p>
<a id="Agriculture" name="Agriculture"></a><h4>Agriculture</h4>
<p>In the mid nineteenth century <a href="/wiki/John_Fowler_(agricultural_engineer)" id="w">John Fowler</a>, an engineer and inventor, began to look at the possibility of using steam engines for ploughing and digging drainage channels. The system that he invented involved either a single stationary engine at the corner of a field drawing a plough via sets of winches and pulleys, or two engines placed at either end of a field drawing the plough backwards and forwards between them by means of a cable attached to winches. Fowler&#39;s ploughing system vastly reduced the cost of ploughing farmland compared with horse-drawn ploughs. Also his ploughing system, when used for digging drainage channels, made possible the cultivation of previously unusable swampy land.</p>
<a id="Transport_in_Britain" name="Transport_in_Britain"></a><h2>Transport in Britain</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea. Railways or wagon ways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been constructed. Animals supplied all of the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution improved Britain&#39;s transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network, a canal, and waterway network, and a railway network. Raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before. Improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly.</p>
<a id="Coastal_sail" name="Coastal_sail"></a><h4>Coastal sail</h4>
<p>Sailing vessels had long been used for moving goods round the British coast. The trade transporting coal to London from Newcastle had begun in <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">mediaeval</a> times. The major international seaports such as London, Bristol, and Liverpool, were the means by which raw materials such as cotton might be imported and finished goods exported. Transporting goods onwards within Britain by sea was common during the whole of the Industrial Revolution and only fell away with the growth of the railways at the end of the period.</p>
<a id="Navigable_rivers" name="Navigable_rivers"></a><h4>Navigable rivers</h4>
<p>{{see also}}</p>
<p>All the major rivers of the United Kingdom were navigable during the Industrial Revolution. Some were anciently navigable, notably the <a href="/wiki/Severn" id="w">Severn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thames" id="w">Thames</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Trent" id="w">Trent</a>. Some were improved, or had navigation extended upstream, but usually in the period before the Industrial Revolution, rather than during it.  </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Severn" id="w">Severn</a>, in particular, was used for the movement of goods to the Midlands which had been imported into Bristol from abroad, and for the export of goods from centres of production in <a href="/wiki/Shropshire" id="w">Shropshire</a> (such as iron goods from <a href="/wiki/Coalbrookdale" id="w">Coalbrookdale</a>) and the <a href="/wiki/Black_Country" id="w">Black Country</a>. Transport was by way of <a href="/wiki/Trow" id="w">trows</a>&#8212;small sailing vessels which could pass the various shallows and bridges in the river. The trows could navigate the Bristol Channel to the South Wales ports and Somerset ports, such as <a href="/wiki/Bridgwater" id="w">Bridgwater</a> and even as far as France.</p>
<a id="Canals" name="Canals"></a><h4>Canals</h4>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Canals began to be built in the late eighteenth century to link the major manufacturing centres in the Midlands and north with seaports and with London, at that time itself the largest manufacturing centre in the country. Canals were the first technology to allow bulk materials to be easily transported across country. A single canal horse could pull a load dozens of times larger than a cart at a faster pace. By the 1820s, a national network was in existence. Canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways. They were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on. </p>
<p>Britain&#39;s canal network, together with its surviving mill buildings, is one of the most enduring features of the early Industrial Revolution to be seen in Britain.</p>


<a id="Roads" name="Roads"></a><h4>Roads</h4>
<p><div style="wigth:250px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:250px-ironbridge1.JPG" title="[[The Iron Bridge]] (1781)&#60;br /&#62;The first large bridge made of cast iron"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/250px-ironbridge1.JPG" alt="[[The Iron Bridge]] (1781)&#60;br /&#62;The first large bridge made of cast iron" title="[[The Iron Bridge]] (1781)&#60;br /&#62;The first large bridge made of cast iron" class="location-right type-thumb" width="250px" />

Much of the original British road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes, but from the 1720s (and occasionally earlier) <a href="/wiki/Turnpike" id="w">turnpike</a> trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads. Increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s to the extent that almost every main road in England and Wales was the responsibility of some <a href="/wiki/Turnpike_trust" id="w">turnpike trust</a>. New engineered roads were built by <a href="/wiki/John_Metcalf_(Civil_engineer)" id="w">John Metcalf</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Telford" id="w">Thomas Telford</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Loudon_McAdam" id="w">John Macadam</a>. The major turnpikes radiated from London and were the means by which the Royal Mail was able to reach the rest of the country. Heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow, broad wheeled, carts hauled by teams of horses. Lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of <a href="/wiki/Pack_horse" id="w">pack horse</a>. Stage coaches carried the rich, and the less wealthy could pay to ride on <a href="/wiki/Un-sprung_cart" id="w">carriers carts</a>.</p>

Wagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the 17th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement of coal. These were all horse drawn or relied on gravity, with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline. The first applications of the steam <a href="/wiki/Locomotive" id="w">locomotive</a> were on wagon or plate ways (as they were then often called from the cast iron plates used). Horse-drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the 19th century. Steam-hauled public railways began with the <a href="/wiki/Stockton_and_Darlington" id="w">Stockton and Darlington</a> Railway in 1825 and the <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway" id="w">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a> in 1830. The construction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>After many of the workers had completed the railways, they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities, providing additional workers for the factories.</p>
<p>Railways helped Britain&#39;s trade enormously, providing a quick and easy way of transport.</p>
<a id="Social_effects" name="Social_effects"></a><h1>Social effects</h1>
<p>In terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a <a href="/wiki/Middle_class" id="w">middle class</a> of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry.</p>
<p>Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. However, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the industrial revolution took place as well. Pre-industrial society was very static and often cruel&#8212;child labour, dirty living conditions and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

</p>
<p>Industrialisation led to the creation of the <a href="/wiki/Factory" id="w">factory</a>. Arguably the first was <a href="/wiki/John_Lombe" id="w">John Lombe</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Derby_Industrial_Museum" id="w">water-powered silk mill</a> at <a href="/wiki/Derby" id="w">Derby</a>, operational by 1721. However, the rise of the factory came somewhat later when cotton spinning was mechanised.  </p>
<p>The factory system was largely responsible for the rise of the modern <a href="/wiki/City" id="w">city</a>, as large numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of employment in the factories. Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of <a href="/wiki/Manchester" id="w">Manchester</a>, nicknamed &#34;<a href="/wiki/Cottonopolis" id="w">Cottonopolis</a>&#34;, and arguably the world&#39;s first industrial city. For much of the 19th century, production was done in small mills, which were typically <a href="/wiki/Watermills_in_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">water-powered</a> and built to serve local needs. Later each factory would have its own steam engine and a tall chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler.</p>
<p>The transition to industrialisation was not without difficulty. For example, a group of English workers known as <a href="/wiki/Luddite" id="w">Luddites</a> formed to protest against industrialisation and sometimes <a href="/wiki/Sabotage" id="w">sabotaged</a> factories. </p>
<p>In other industries the transition to factory production was not so divisive. Some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers. One of the earliest such reformers was <a href="/wiki/Robert_Owen" id="w">Robert Owen</a>, known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the <a href="/wiki/Robert_Owen#Philanthropy in New Lanark (1800)" id="w">New Lanark mills</a>, and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the <a href="/wiki/Utopian_socialism" id="w">early socialist movement</a>.</p>
<p>By 1746, an integrated brass mill was working at <a href="/wiki/Warmley" id="w">Warmley</a> near <a href="/wiki/Bristol" id="w">Bristol</a>. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. <a href="/wiki/Josiah_Wedgwood" id="w">Josiah Wedgwood</a> and <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Boulton" id="w">Matthew Boulton</a> were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system.</p>

<div class="framecaption">A young &#34;drawer&#34; pulling a coal tub up a mine shaft</div>
The Industrial Revolution led to a population increase, but the chance of surviving childhood didn&#39;t improve throughout the industrial revolution.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> There was still limited opportunity for education, and children were expected to work. Employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable; there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine, and since the industrial system was completely new there were no experienced adult labourers. This made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the industrial revolution.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Child_labour" id="w">Child labour</a> had existed before the Industrial Revolution, but with the increase in population and education it became more visible. Before the passing of laws protecting children, many were forced to work in terrible conditions for much lower pay than their elders.</p>
<p>Reports were written detailing some of the abuses, particularly in the coal mines<a class="externallink" href="http://www.victorianweb.org/history/ashley.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.victorianweb.org/history/ashley.html">http://www.victorianweb.org/history/ashley.html</a> and textile factories<a class="externallink" href="http://www.victorianweb.org/history/workers1.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.victorianweb.org/history/workers1.html">http://www.victorianweb.org/history/workers1.html</a> and these helped to popularise the children&#39;s plight. The public outcry, especially among the upper and middle classes, helped stir change in the young workers&#39; welfare.</p>
<p>Politicians and the government tried to limit child labour by law, but factory owners resisted; some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid <a href="/wiki/Starvation" id="w">starvation</a>, and others simply welcomed the cheap labour. In 1833 and 1844, the first general laws against child labour, the <a href="/wiki/Factory_Acts" id="w">Factory Acts</a>, were passed in England: Children younger than nine were not allowed to work, children were not permitted to work at night, and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours. Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law. About ten years later, the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden. These laws decreased the number of child labourers; however, child labour remained in Europe up to the 20th century.</p>

<p>Living conditions during the Industrial Revolution varied from the splendour of the homes of the owners to the squalor of the lives of the workers. <a href="/wiki/Cliffe_Castle" id="w">Cliffe Castle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Keighley" id="w">Keighley</a>, is a good example of how the newly rich chose to live. This is a large home modelled loosely on a castle with towers and garden walls. The home is very large and was surrounded by a massive garden, the Cliffe Castle is now open to the public as a museum.</p>
<p>Poor people lived in very small houses in cramped streets. These homes would share toilet facilities, have open sewers and would be at risk of <a href="/wiki/Damp" id="w">damp</a>. Disease was spread through a contaminated water supply. Conditions did improve during the 19th century as public health acts were introduced covering things such as sewage, hygiene and making some boundaries upon the construction of homes. Not everybody lived in homes like these. The Industrial Revolution created a larger middle class of professionals such as lawyers and doctors. The conditions for the poor improved over the course of the 19th century because of government and local plans which led to cities becoming cleaner places, but life had not been easy for the poor before industrialisation. However, as a result of the Revolution, huge numbers of the working class died due to disease spreading through the cramped living conditions. Chest diseases from the mines, <a href="/wiki/Cholera" id="w">cholera</a> from polluted water and typhoid were also extremely common, as was smallpox. Accidents in factories with child and female workers were regular. <a href="/wiki/Charles_Dickens" id="w">Dickens&#39;</a> novels perhaps best illustrate this; even some government officials were horrified by what they saw. Strikes and riots by workers were also relatively common.</p>
<a id="Luddites" name="Luddites"></a><h2>Luddites</h2>
<p>{{main}}
The rapid industrialisation of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs. The textile industry in particular industrialised early, and many weavers found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver. Many such unemployed workers, weavers and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery. These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly followers of <a href="/wiki/Ned_Ludd" id="w">Ned Ludd</a>, a folklore figure. The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811. The Luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the British government had to take drastic measures to protect industry.</p>
<a id="Organisation_of_labour" name="Organisation_of_labour"></a><h2>Organisation of labour</h2>
<dl><dd><i>See also <a href="/wiki/Trade_union#History" id="w">Labour history</a></i></dd></dl>
<p>The Industrial Revolution concentrated labour into mills, factories and mines, thus facilitating the organisation of <i>combinations</i> or <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" id="w">trade unions</a> to help advance the interests of working people. The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production. Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffer the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining.</p>
<p>The main method the unions used to effect change was <a href="/wiki/Strike_action" id="w">strike action</a>. Many strikes were painful events for both sides, the unions and the management. In England, the <a href="/wiki/Combination_Laws" id="w">Combination Act</a> forbade workers to form any kind of trade union from 1799 until its repeal in 1824. Even after this, unions were still severely restricted.</p>
<p>In the 1830s and 1840s the <a href="/wiki/Chartist" id="w">Chartist</a> movement was the first large scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice. Its <i>Charter</i> of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without consideration. </p>
<p>Working people also formed <a href="/wiki/Friendly_society" id="w">friendly societies</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cooperative" id="w">co-operative societies</a> as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship. Enlighted industrialists, such as <a href="/wiki/Robert_Owen" id="w">Robert Owen</a> also supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the working class.</p>
<p>Unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike. In 1842, a <a href="/wiki/General_Strike" id="w">General Strike</a> involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the <a href="/wiki/Chartist" id="w">Chartist</a> movement which stopped production across Great Britain.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eventually effective political organisation for working people was achieved through the trades unions who, after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885, began to support socialist political parties that later merged to became the British <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" id="w">Labour Party</a>.</p>

<p>The application of steam power to the industrial processes of <a href="/wiki/Printing" id="w">printing</a> supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing, which reinforced rising literacy and demands for mass political participation.</p>
<p>During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730 - 1749 to 31.8% in 1810 - 1829.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> Besides, there was a significant increase in worker wages during the period 1813-1913.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

<a id="United_States" name="United_States"></a><h2>United States</h2>
<p>{{main}}
As in Britain, the United States originally used water power to run its factories, with the consequence that industrialisation was essentially limited to <a href="/wiki/New_England" id="w">New England</a> and the rest of the <a href="/wiki/Northeastern_United_States" id="w">Northeastern United States</a>, where fast-moving rivers were located. However, the raw materials (cotton) came from the <a href="/wiki/Southern_United_States" id="w">Southern United States</a>. It was not until after the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a> in the 1860s that steam-powered manufacturing overtook water-powered manufacturing, allowing the industry to fully spread across the nation. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Samuel_Slater" id="w">Samuel Slater</a> (1768–1835) is popularly known as the founder of the American cotton industry. As a boy apprentice in Derbyshire, England he learnt of the new techniques in the textile industry and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for New York in 1789, hoping to make money with his knowledge. Slater started <a href="/wiki/Slater%26%2339%3Bs_mill" id="w">Slater&#39;s mill</a> at <a href="/wiki/Pawtucket%2C_Rhode_Island" id="w">Pawtucket, Rhode Island</a>, in 1793 and went on to own thirteen textile mills.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Day" id="w">Daniel Day</a> established a wool carding mill in the <a href="/wiki/Blackstone_Valley" id="w">Blackstone Valley</a> at <a href="/wiki/Uxbridge%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Uxbridge, Massachusetts</a> in 1810, the third woolen mill established in the <a href="/wiki/U.S" id="w">U.S</a>.

At its peak over 1100 mills operated in this valley, including Slater&#39;s mill, and with it the earliest beginnings of America&#39;s Industrial and Technological Development. (see also <a href="/wiki/Blackstone_River_Valley_National_Heritage_Corridor" id="w">Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor</a>)</p>
<p>While on a trip to England in 1810, <a href="/wiki/Newburyport%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Newburyport, Massachusetts</a> merchant <a href="/wiki/Francis_Cabot_Lowell_(businessman)" id="w">Francis Cabot Lowell</a> was allowed to tour the British textile factories, but not take notes. Realising the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812" id="w">War of 1812</a> had ruined his import business but that a market for domestic finished cloth was emerging in America, he memorised the design of textile machines, and on his return to the United States, he set up the <a href="/wiki/Boston_Manufacturing_Company" id="w">Boston Manufacturing Company</a>. Lowell and his partners built America&#39;s first cotton-to-cloth textile mill at <a href="/wiki/Waltham%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Waltham, Massachusetts</a>. After his death in 1817, his Associates built America&#39;s first planned factory town, which they named after him. This enterprise was capitalised in a <a href="/wiki/Public_stock_offering" id="w">public stock offering</a>, one of the first uses of it in the United States.  <a href="/wiki/Lowell%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Lowell, Massachusetts</a>, utilising 5.6 miles of canals and ten thousand horsepower delivered by the <a href="/wiki/Merrimack_River" id="w">Merrimack River</a>, is considered the &#39;Cradle of the American Industrial Revolution&#39;. The short-lived utopia-like <a href="/wiki/Lowell_system" id="w">Lowell System</a> was formed, as a direct response to the poor working conditions in Britain. However, by 1850, especially following the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Potato_Famine" id="w">Irish Potato Famine</a>, the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour.</p>

<p>The Industrial Revolution on Continental <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> came later than in <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">Great Britain</a>. In many industries, this involved the application of technology developed in Britain in new places. Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and enterpeneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities. By 1809 part of the <a href="/wiki/Ruhr_Area" id="w">Ruhr Valley</a> in Westphalia were being called <i>Miniature England</i> because of its similarities to the industrial areas of England. The German, Russian and Belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries. </p>
<p>In some cases (such as <a href="/wiki/Iron" id="w">iron</a>), the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the British technology were adopted.

<p>In 1871 a group of Japanese politicians known as the <a href="/wiki/Iwakura_Mission" id="w">Iwakura Mission</a> toured Europe and the USA to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state led industrialisation policy to prevent Japan from falling behind. The <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_Japan" id="w">Bank of Japan</a>, founded in 1877, used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories.

<p>The insatiable demand of the railways for more durable rail led to the development of the means to cheaply mass-produce steel. Steel is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass-production, which are said to characterise a &#34;Second Industrial Revolution&#34;, beginning around 1850. This second Industrial Revolution gradually grew to include the <a href="/wiki/Chemical_industry" id="w">chemical industries</a>, <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" id="w">petroleum</a> refining and distribution, <a href="/wiki/Electrical_industry" id="w">electrical industries</a>, and, in the twentieth century, the <a href="/wiki/Automotive_industry" id="w">automotive industries</a>, and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from Britain to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>.</p>
<p>The introduction of <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectric_power" id="w">hydroelectric power</a> generation in the <a href="/wiki/Alps" id="w">Alps</a> enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal-deprived northern <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>, beginning in the 1890s. The increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan" id="w">Marshall McLuhan</a> analysed the social and cultural impact of the <a href="/wiki/Electric_age" id="w">electric age</a>. While the previous age of <a href="/wiki/Mechanization" id="w">mechanization</a> had spread the idea of splitting every process into a sequence, this was ended by the introduction of the instant speed of electricity that brought simultaneity. This imposed the cultural shift from the approach of focusing on &#34;specialized segments of attention&#34; (adopting one particular perspective), to the idea of &#34;instant sensory awareness of the whole&#34;, an attention to the &#34;total field&#34;, a &#34;sense of the whole pattern&#34;. It made evident and prevalent the sense of &#34;form and function as a unity&#34;, an &#34;integral idea of structure and configuration&#34;. This had major impact in the disciplines of painting (with <a href="/wiki/Cubism" id="w">cubism</a>), physics, poetry, communication and <a href="/wiki/Educational_theory" id="w">educational theory</a>.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the 1890s, industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests, as companies like <a href="/wiki/United_States_Steel_Corporation" id="w">U.S. Steel</a>, <a href="/wiki/General_Electric" id="w">General Electric</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bayer" id="w">Bayer AG</a> joined the railroad companies on the world&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Stock_market" id="w">stock markets</a>.</p>

<p>{{main}}
The advent of <a href="/wiki/The_Enlightenment" id="w">The Enlightenment</a> provided an intellectual framework which welcomed the practical application of the growing body of scientific knowledge &#8212; a factor evidenced in the systematic development of the steam engine, guided by scientific analysis, and the development of the political and <a href="/wiki/Sociology" id="w">sociological</a> analyzes, culminating in <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" id="w">Adam Smith</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations" id="w">The Wealth of Nations</a>. One of the main arguments for capitalism is that industrialization increases wealth for all, as evidenced by raised life expectancy, reduced working hours, and no work for children and the elderly (though these benefits did not occur for the lower class until the 20th century).</p>
<a id="Marxism" name="Marxism"></a><h2>Marxism</h2>
<p>{{main}}
Marxism is essentially a reaction to the Industrial Revolution.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> According to <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" id="w">Karl Marx</a>, industrialization polarized society into the <a href="/wiki/Bourgeoisie" id="w">bourgeoisie</a> (those who own the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" id="w">means of production</a>, the factories and the land) and the much larger <a href="/wiki/Proletariat" id="w">proletariat</a> (the working class who actually perform the <a href="/wiki/Labour_(economics)" id="w">labour</a> necessary to extract something valuable from the means of production). He saw the industrialization process as the logical <a href="/wiki/Dialectics" id="w">dialectical</a> progression of feudal economic modes, necessary for the full development of capitalism, which he saw as in itself a necessary precursor to the development of <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialism</a> and eventually <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">communism</a>.</p>
<a id="Romanticism" name="Romanticism"></a><h2>Romanticism</h2>
<p>{{main}}
During the Industrial Revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialization developed. This was known as the Romantic movement. Its major exponents in English included the artist and poet <a href="/wiki/William_Blake" id="w">William Blake</a> and poets <a href="/wiki/William_Wordsworth" id="w">William Wordsworth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge" id="w">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Keats" id="w">John Keats</a>, <a href="/wiki/Byron" id="w">Byron</a> and <a href="/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley" id="w">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>. The movement stressed the importance of &#34;nature&#34; in art and language, in contrast to &#39;monstrous&#39; machines and factories; the &#34;<i>Dark satanic mills</i>&#34; of Blake&#39;s poem <i><a href="/wiki/And_did_those_feet_in_ancient_time" id="w">And did those feet in ancient time</a></i>.  <a href="/wiki/Mary_Shelley" id="w">Mary Shelley</a>&#39;s short story <i><a href="/wiki/Frankenstein" id="w">Frankenstein</a></i> reflected concerns that scientific progress might be two-edged.</p>
