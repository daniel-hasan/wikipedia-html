He played for <a href="/wiki/Aberdeen_F.C." id="w">Aberdeen</a> in Scotland and a number of clubs in <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> - he most notably won the 1970 <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Cup" id="w">Scottish Cup</a> with <a href="/wiki/Aberdeen_F.C." id="w">Aberdeen</a>, and was inducted into the <a href="/wiki/Aberdeen_F.C.#AFC Hall of Fame" id="w">Aberdeen FC &#34;Hall of Fame&#34;</a> as one of the founding members in 2003.He also served with the police forces in the north of Scotland and <a href="/wiki/Queensland" id="w">Queensland</a>.</p>

<p>Hermiston began his career as a teenager with <a href="/wiki/Bonnyrigg_Rose_Athletic_F.C." id="w">Bonnyrigg Rose</a>, and was signed for Aberdeen by <a href="/wiki/Eddie_Turnbull" id="w">Eddie Turnbull</a> in 1965.  He made his debut for Aberdeen the following year, and went on to play 270 times for the club in all competitions.  He was a member of the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Cup_1969-70" id="w">1969-70 Scottish Cup</a> winning team, and was captain of the side toward the end of his time there<sup id="_ref-Legends_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Legends" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Hermiston was overlooked for the <a href="/wiki/Scotland_national_football_team" id="w">Scotland squad</a> for the <a href="/wiki/1974_FIFA_World_Cup" id="w">1974 World Cup</a>, and this led him to seek a move to England.  However, a proposed transfer to <a href="/wiki/Chelsea_F.C." id="w">Chelsea</a> failed to materialise, and Hermiston decided to retire from the game at the age of 27 to join <a href="/wiki/Grampian_Police" id="w">Grampian Police</a> as a Police Constable.  It is possible that as a PC, his duties may have included policing matches at Aberdeen&#39;s ground, <a href="/wiki/Pittodrie_Stadium" id="w">Pittodrie Stadium</a>, but it is not clear whether he ever actually did so.<sup id="_ref-Legends_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Legends" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hermiston and his family emigrated to Australia shortly afterwards, and he resumed his football career there, playing for <a href="/wiki/Grange_Thistle" id="w">Grange Thistle</a>, then <a href="/wiki/Brisbane_City_Soccer_Club" id="w">Brisbane City</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brisbane_Lions_SC" id="w">Brisbane Lions</a> before returning to police work after a brief spell as manager of Brisbane City<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Hermiston was a popular player in Australia, to the extent of having a children&#39;s coaching manual published under his name<sup id="_ref-Book_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Book" title="">[3]</a></sup>.  He was twice in <a href="/wiki/Philips_Cup" id="w">Philips Cup</a> winning teams, and was even considered as a potential captain of the <a href="/wiki/Australia_national_football_(soccer)_team" id="w">Australian team</a> <sup id="_ref-Legends_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Legends" title="">[1]</a></sup>.  However, this did not come to pass thanks to Hermiston having played part of a game for the Scottish Under-23 side in the early 1970s - the international rules at the time forbidding a player who had represented one country at any level from representing another.  He also played one game for the Scottish League representative side, a 5-0 defeat by the English League team at <a href="/wiki/Maine_Road" id="w">Maine Road</a>, Manchester on March 20th, 1974.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
