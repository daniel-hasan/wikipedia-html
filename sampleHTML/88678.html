<a id="Story" name="Story"></a><h2>Story</h2>
<p>The story of <i>The Lion King</i> takes place in the fictional Pride Lands of Africa, where a lion rules over the other animals as high king. At the beginning of the film, Rafiki, a wise old <a href="/wiki/Mandrill" id="w">mandrill</a> <a href="/wiki/Shaman" id="w">shaman</a>, blesses <a href="/wiki/Simba" id="w">Simba</a>, the newborn cub of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, and presents him to a massive gathering of animals at Pride Rock. Meanwhile, Mufasa&#39;s younger brother, Scar, realizes that he is no longer the heir to the throne and plots to kill Simba and Mufasa.</p>
<p>A few months later, Mufasa brings Simba on a tour of the Pride Lands while teaching him about the Circle of Life, the delicate balance which affects all living things, which is the king&#39;s responsibility to maintain. The tour is cut short when Mufasa&#39;s advisor, the <a href="/wiki/Hornbill" id="w">hornbill</a> Zazu, alerts him of poaching hyenas in the Pride Lands, and Mufasa sends a reluctant Simba home while he deals with the threat. Back at Pride Rock, Scar plants curiosity in Simba about the <a href="/wiki/Elephant%26%2339%3Bs_graveyard" id="w">elephant graveyard</a>, a place beyond the borders of the Pride Lands where Mufasa has forbidden Simba to go. Simba takes his friend, Nala, to the elephant graveyard, where the cubs are chased by Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, Scar&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Spotted_hyena" id="w">spotted hyena</a> minions, only to be rescued by Mufasa.</p> 
<p>Mufasa scolds Simba on the walk home, and explains to Simba that being brave dosen&#39;t mean going to look for trouble. When asked if he&#39;ll always be with him (Simba), Mufasa tells his son that the great kings of the past watch over all from the stars, just as he (Mufasa) will watch over Simba one day. Meanwhile, Scar becomes very angry as he intended for the hyenas to kill the cubs. Plotting further, Scar gathers more hyenas and buys their loyalty by claiming that if he were king they would never be without food.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">left</div></div>
</p>
<p>A few days later, Scar lures Simba into a gorge for a &#34;surprise from his father,&#34; while the hyenas engineer a <a href="/wiki/Wildebeest" id="w">wildebeest</a> stampede down into the gorge where Simba is. Alerted by an insincerely dramatic Scar, Mufasa races to rescue his son from the stampede, and after saving Simba, Mufasa is murdered by Scar, who thwarts his attempted climb to safety over an edge of a cliff. &#34;Long live the King,&#34; snarls Scar as he knocks his brother into the stampede. Scar convinces Simba that the young cub was responsible for his own father&#39;s death, and recommends that he flee the Pride Lands, never to return. To compound this, Scar sends his hyena henchmen to kill Simba, but as Simba flees through a thornbush-covered embankment, the hyenas break off pursuit and let him escape, hurling threats that he will be killed if ever seen again.  Informed that both Mufasa and Simba were killed, the pride regretfully allows Scar to assume the throne as the closest of kin.</p>
<p>Simba collapses in a distant desert, where he is found by Timon, a <a href="/wiki/Meerkat" id="w">meerkat</a>, and Pumbaa, a <a href="/wiki/Warthog" id="w">warthog</a>, who adopt and raise Simba under their carefree &#34;<a href="/wiki/Hakuna_Matata" id="w">Hakuna Matata</a>&#34; lifestyle. When Simba is grown, he is discovered by his childhood friend Nala, who relays that Scar&#39;s tyrannical reign has devastated the Pride Lands by allowing the hyenas to hunt recklessly, a problem further compounded by a severe drought, and the animal herds have been forced to move on. She demands that Simba return and take his rightful place as king, but Simba refuses, still guilty about supposedly causing his father&#39;s death. </p>
<p>Simba then shows Nala around (while <a href="/wiki/&amp;quot%3BCan_You_Feel_the_Love_Tonight%26quot%3B" id="w">&#34;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&#34;</a> is playing), and find themselves in love. But, immediately afterwards, Nala tells Simba that she doesn&#39;t understand why he won&#39;t return to Pride Rock, and the two become furious, confused, and a bit misunderstood, at each other. However, after some advice from Rafiki and the ghost of his father, Simba returns home, followed by Timon, Pumbaa and Nala.</p>
<p>Once back at Pride Rock, Simba confronts his uncle and the truth about Mufasa&#39;s death is revealed by an overly confident Scar. A fierce battle breaks out between the lionesses and the hyenas while Simba fights Scar solo. Lightning strikes the dry brush, and soon Pride Rock is surrounded by flames. Rafiki, Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa join the battle and fight off Shenzi, Ed and Banzai. In the midst of their fight, Scar becomes cornered and tries to surreptitiously blame everything on the hyenas, but they overhear his conversation with Simba. Simba eventually triumphs over his uncle and kicks him over a low cliff, where he is surrounded by the now resentful hyenas. The hyenas surround their traitorous fallen leader and kill him, just as everything is seemingly enveloped by the fire. </p>
<p>A downpour extinguishes the brushfire, however, and Simba subsequently reconciles with his family, Rafiki directs Simba to Pride Rock&#39;s overlook with the words &#34;It is time&#34;. As Simba reaches the top of the overlook, he see the stars shining down on him and, emboldened, roars to signify that he is now king of the Pride Lands. With Simba and Nala as the new king and queen, the Pride Lands soon become green with life again, and the herds return. The movie concludes with Rafiki lifting Simba and Nala&#39;s newborn cub high into the air, thus continuing the circle of life.</p>
<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h2>Production</h2>
<p><i>The Lion King</i> was originally called <i>King of the Jungle</i> during early stages of production.<sup id="_ref-kingofthejungle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kingofthejungle" title="">[3]</a></sup> As in the case of the earlier film <i><a href="/wiki/Bambi" id="w">Bambi</a></i>, animators studied real-life animals for reference, and some of the filmmakers went to <a href="/wiki/Kenya" id="w">Kenya</a> to observe the natural habitat that would be shown in the film.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The film&#39;s significant use of computers helped the filmmakers to present their vision in new ways. These include some shots of Pride Rock, tall green grass, the smoke from the fire, and the waterfall in the new version of &#34;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&#34;. The most notable use of <a href="/wiki/Computer_animation" id="w">computer animation</a> is in the &#34;wildebeest stampede&#34; sequence. Several distinct wildebeest characters were built in a 3D computer program, multiplied into the hundreds, <a href="/wiki/Cel_shading" id="w">cel shaded</a> to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd. Similar multiplication occurs in the &#34;Be Prepared&#34; musical number with identical marching hyenas.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>The Lion King</i> was once considered a secondary project to <i><a href="/wiki/Pocahontas_(1995_film)" id="w">Pocahontas</a></i>, both of which were in production at the same time. Most of the Disney Feature Animation staff preferred to work on <i>Pocahontas</i>, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> While both films were commercial and critical successes,<i>The Lion King</i> received a greater amount of positive feedback and larger grosses than <i>Pocahontas</i>, but both became known Disney classics.<sup id="_ref-rottentomatoestlk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rottentomatoestlk" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-rottentomatoespocahontas_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rottentomatoespocahontas" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The animation was done by <a href="/wiki/SEK_Studio" id="w">SEK Studio</a> in <a href="/wiki/North_Korea" id="w">North Korea</a>.</p>

<p>The film&#39;s original motion picture soundtrack was released on <a href="/wiki/July_13" id="w">July 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_28" id="w">February 28</a> <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a>, Disney released an album entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Rhythm_of_the_Pride_Lands" id="w">Rhythm of the Pride Lands</a></i>, a sequel of sorts to the original soundtrack which featured songs and performances inspired by, but not featured in, the film.  Most of the tracks were composed by African composer Lebo M and focused primarily on the African influences of the film&#39;s original music, with most songs being sung either partially or entirely in various African languages. Several songs featured in the album would later have incarnations in other <i>The Lion King</i>-oriented projects, such as the stage musical or the direct-to-video sequels (examples being &#34;He Lives In You&#34; used as the opening song for <i>The Lion King II: Simba&#39;s Pride</i>; and a reincarnation of &#34;Warthog Rhapsody&#34;, called &#34;That&#39;s All I Need&#34;, in <i>The Lion King 1½</i>). <i>Rhythm of the Pride Lands</i> was initially printed in a very limited quantity. However, it was re-released in 2003 and included in some international versions of <i>The Lion King<b>s special edition soundtrack with an additional track.
It&#39;s been circulating from hand to hand for a while now, but now it&#39;s been posted on an official page at Hans-Zimmer.com that a long-lost &#34;Lion King Expanded Score&#34; has appeared on several download sites and is achieving broad acknowledgment among fans of Zimmer&#39;s music and TLK alike.</b></i></p>
<p>This score contains 21 tracks, 16 of which consist of never-before-released instrumental music from Hans Zimmer&#39;s original masterpiece score. The linked site contains track information and a message discussion board, where more information can be obtained on how to find a copy of the score.</p>
<p>The Expanded Score was available for purchase on eBay.</p>
<a id="Sequels_and_spin-offs" name="Sequels_and_spin-offs"></a><h2>Sequels and spin-offs</h2>

<i>The Lion King</i> was originally advertised as being the first animated Disney film not based on an already-existing story. However, elements of the film bear a resemblance to a famous 1960s <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a> <a href="/wiki/Television" id="w">television</a> show, <i><a href="/wiki/Kimba_the_White_Lion" id="w">Kimba the White Lion</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Kimba_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kimba" title="">[23]</a></sup>  One similarity between the two is that the protagonists&#39; names (Kimba and Simba) are very alike. Other coincidences include that most characters in <i>Kimba</i> have an analogue in <i>The Lion King</i> and that various individual scenes are nearly identical in composition and camera angle. Early production artwork on the Lion King Platinum Edition DVD even depicts a white lion.<sup id="_ref-kimbarant_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kimbarant" title="">[24]</a></sup> Disney&#39;s official stance is that any resemblance is coincidental, and directors <a href="/wiki/Roger_Allers" id="w">Roger Allers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rob_Minkoff" id="w">Rob Minkoff</a> stated that they were well into the development process before the <i>Kimba</i> similarity was identified. Despite the resemblances between the film and the series, the family of <a href="/wiki/Osamu_Tezuka" id="w">Osamu Tezuka</a>, <i>Kimba<b>s creator, has not filed a lawsuit. </b></i></p>
<p>The character designs and scenes are the only things that have been speculated to be taken from Kimba, the story from the anime and the Lion King story are quite different. The filmmakers, however, admitted that the story of <i>The Lion King</i> was inspired by the 1942 Disney animated film <i><a href="/wiki/Bambi" id="w">Bambi</a></i>, the <a href="/wiki/Joseph_(Hebrew_Bible)" id="w">Joseph</a> and <a href="/wiki/Moses" id="w">Moses</a> stories from the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible</a>, and <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" id="w">William Shakespeare</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Hamlet" id="w">Hamlet</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-storyinspiration_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-storyinspiration" title="">[25]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Vogler" id="w">Christopher Vogler</a>, in his book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Writer%26%2339%3Bs_Journey:_Mythic_Structure_For_Writers" id="w">The Writer&#39;s Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers</a></i>, described Disney&#39;s request that he suggest how to improve the plot of <i>The Lion King</i> by incorporating ideas from <i>Hamlet</i>.<sup id="_ref-mythicstructure_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mythicstructure" title="">[26]</a></sup> </p>
