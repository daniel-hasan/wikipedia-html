<p>The <b>Mini Moke</b> is a vehicle based on the <a href="/wiki/Mini" id="w">Mini</a> and designed for the <a href="/wiki/British_Motor_Corporation" id="w">British Motor Corporation</a> (BMC) by <a href="/wiki/Alec_Issigonis" id="w">Sir Alec Issigonis</a>.<sup id="_ref-issigbio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-issigbio" title="">[1]</a></sup> The name comes from &#34;Mini&#34;—the car with which the Moke shares many parts—and &#34;Moke&#34;, which is an archaic dialect term for &#34;<a href="/wiki/Donkey" id="w">donkey</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-nuttall1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nuttall1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-rees1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rees1" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-clarke3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke3" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The initial design was a prototype for a light military vehicle in the style of the American <a href="/wiki/Jeep#The origins of the vehicle: the first jeeps" id="w">Jeep</a>, but its small wheels and low <a href="/wiki/Ride_height" id="w">ground clearance</a> made it impractical as an <a href="/wiki/Off-road_vehicle" id="w">off-road vehicle</a>. It was subsequently offered in a civilian version as a low-cost, easily maintained utility vehicle. The Moke finally achieved success as a <a href="/wiki/Dune_buggy" id="w">beach buggy</a> — becoming a popular &#39;cult&#39; vehicle in the <a href="/wiki/Seychelles" id="w">Seychelles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and many tropical resorts in the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" id="w">Caribbean</a>. The original Moke used identical <a href="/wiki/BMC_A-Series_engine" id="w">engine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics)" id="w">transmission</a> and <a href="/wiki/Suspension_(vehicle)" id="w">suspension</a> parts to the basic Mini.<sup id="_ref-clarke1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke1" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-clarke2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke2" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Mokes were first built at the Morris factory in Oxford before production moved to BMC&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Longbridge_plant" id="w">Longbridge, Birmingham plant</a>, and eventually overseas. 14,500 Mokes were produced in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">UK</a> between 1964 and 1968, 26,000 in <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> between 1966 and 1981, and 10,000 in <a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portugal</a> between 1980 and 1993 when production of the Moke ended.<sup id="_ref-rees1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rees1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>When Issigonis designed the <a href="/wiki/Mini" id="w">Mini</a>, he planned another vehicle to share the Mini&#39;s mechanical parts, but with a more rugged body shell. This was an attempt to take a portion of the military vehicle business from <a href="/wiki/Land_Rover" id="w">Land Rover</a>. Issigonis had previously designed the <a href="/wiki/Nuffield_Guppy" id="w">Nuffield Guppy</a> in a failed attempt to break into that market. By 1959, BMC had working prototypes of what was codenamed &#34;The Buckboard&#34;, later to become the &#34;Mini Moke&#34;. These prototypes were shown to the <a href="/wiki/British_Army" id="w">British Army</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Airdrop" id="w">parachute-droppable</a> vehicle, but poor ground clearance and a low-powered engine did not meet the most basic requirements for an off-road vehicle. Only the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" id="w">Royal Navy</a> showed any interest at all in the Buckboard—as a vehicle for use on the decks of <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_carrier" id="w">aircraft carriers</a>.<sup id="_ref-rees1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rees1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Early promotional material made much of the lightness of the vehicle, showing four soldiers riding in the Moke off-road, then picking it up by its tubular <a href="/wiki/Bumper_(automobile)" id="w">bumpers</a> and carrying it when (inevitably) its low ground clearance proved inadequate to the task.</p>
<p>In a further attempt to make something for the army, a few <a href="/wiki/Four-wheel_drive" id="w">four-wheel drive</a> Mokes were made by the addition of a second engine at the back of the vehicle with linked <a href="/wiki/Clutch" id="w">clutches</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gear_stick" id="w">gear shifters</a>. However, this did nothing to solve the ground-clearance issue, and mechanical complications discouraged development beyond the prototype stage.<sup id="_ref-clarke1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke1" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-clarke2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke2" title="">[6]</a></sup> This strange vehicle was called &#34;The Twini&#34; and was shown to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" id="w">US Army</a> - again with no success.<sup id="_ref-nuttall1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nuttall1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Eventually BMC gave up on the idea of selling the Moke to the military, and in 1963 the decision was made to build a civilian version, targeting farmers and <a href="/wiki/Light_industry" id="w">light commercial</a> applications. Several prototypes of this were built in 1963 one of which is still known to exist in Pinner just outside London, England. The Moke was launched onto the British market in 1964. The British <a href="/wiki/Her_Majesty%26%2339%3Bs_Customs_and_Excise" id="w">Customs and Excise department</a> decided that the Moke should be <a href="/wiki/Car_classification" id="w">classified</a> as a passenger car rather than as a <a href="/wiki/Commercial_vehicle" id="w">commercial vehicle</a> which meant that it attracted <a href="/wiki/Sales_tax" id="w">purchase tax</a>, reducing sales in its intended commercial market.<sup id="_ref-golding_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-golding" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Moke attracted attention as a &#39;cult&#39; vehicle as a result of the unprecedented success of the Mini and through media exposure in the popular television series <i><a href="/wiki/The_Prisoner" id="w">The Prisoner</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-white1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-white1" title="">[8]</a></sup> Despite this, of the 14,500 British Mokes sold, only about a tenth of them stayed in Britain.<sup id="_ref-rees1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rees1" title="">[3]</a></sup> Mokes continued to be made in Britain until 1968.</p>

The British-made Mokes were fitted with a low-end 850&#160;<a href="/wiki/Cubic_centimetre" id="w">cc</a> engine which had been detuned to use low-<a href="/wiki/Octane" id="w">octane</a> fuel. They used the same suspension, gearbox and 10&#160;inch wheels as the standard Mini.<sup id="_ref-imp_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-imp" title="">[9]</a></sup> In the initial offering, passenger seats, grab handles, heater, windscreen washer and a removable canvas top were all optional equipment delivered separately from the vehicle. Owners had to bolt these optional extras onto the vehicle themselves.<sup id="_ref-clarke1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke1" title="">[5]</a></sup> The base price was <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" id="w">GB£405</a>.<sup id="_ref-chapman1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chapman1" title="">[10]</a></sup> The &#39;Mk I&#39; Mokes had a single <a href="/wiki/Windscreen_wiper" id="w">windscreen wiper</a> and a floor-mounted <a href="/wiki/Headlamp#Functions and fitment" id="w">headlight dip switch</a>, and the only colour available was &#34;Spruce Green&#34;. In 1967, the &#39;Mk II&#39; Moke added a passenger-side wiper. Horn and headlight controls were moved onto the indicator stalk. These later British Mokes were also available in white.<sup id="_ref-mokeclub_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mokeclub" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/John_Player_%26amp%3B_Sons" id="w">John Player &#38; Sons</a> cigarette company ran a team of Mokes in <a href="/wiki/Autocross" id="w">autocross</a> competitions on grass tracks through 1968.<sup id="_ref-clarke3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke3" title="">[4]</a></sup> These vehicles were equipped with rollover protection and used the <a href="/wiki/Mini#The Mini Cooper and Cooper S – 1961–2000" id="w">Mini Cooper S</a> 1275&#160;cc engine.</p>
<a id="Australian_Mokes" name="Australian_Mokes"></a><h3>Australian Mokes</h3>

<p>The Moke was built in Australia from 1966 to 1981 where it was originally marketed as the <b>Morris Mini Moke</b> and from 1973 as the <b>Leyland Moke</b><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>. Initially Australian Mokes had the same 10&#160;inch wheels as British Mokes and Mini <a href="/wiki/Sedan" id="w">saloons</a>, however these were soon replaced by 13&#160;inch wheels with longer rear trailing arms, which made them more practical for gentle off-road or beach use than the British version. The solid metal seats of the British Mokes were replaced with tubular-framed &#39;deck-chair&#39; seats.<sup id="_ref-mokeclub_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mokeclub" title="">[11]</a></sup> This variant started with a 998&#160;cc engine which was switched in mid-production to 1098&#160;cc. In 1976, with the advent of new <a href="/wiki/Emission_standard" id="w">anti-pollution requirements</a> (Australian Design Rule 27A), the locally manufactured 1098&#160;cc motor was replaced by an imported version of the 998&#160;cc motor with an air pump and exhaust gas recirculation, which had been developed to meet UK anti-pollution requirements.</p>
<p>For a brief period around 1972, Leyland Australia produced a variant referred to in Leyland literature as &#34;Moke, special export&#34;, but commonly called a &#34;Californian&#34;, which had a 1,275&#160;cc engine and was fitted with <a href="/wiki/Automotive_lighting#Sidemarker lights" id="w">side marker lamps</a> and different rear lights to conform to US <a href="/wiki/FMVSS" id="w">FMVSS</a> standards. The fuel tank from the <a href="/wiki/Austin-Healey_Sprite" id="w">Austin Sprite</a> or <a href="/wiki/MG_Midget" id="w">MG Midget</a> was fitted beneath the rear load area, replacing the standard tank mounted in the left sidebox. The export Californian was readily recognisable by its roof and seats, trimmed in &#39;Op-pop verve&#39; black and white tiger striped vinyl or &#39;Orange Bali&#39; vinyl, which looked rather like a fruit salad, <sup id="_ref-Special Export Moke/_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Special Export Moke/" title="">[13]</a></sup>and was briefly marketed to the &#39;<a href="/wiki/Flower_power" id="w">flower power</a>&#39; culture in the United States.</p>
<p>The name &#34;Californian&#34; and the 1275&#160;cc motor were resurrected in 1977 for Australian market Mokes with <a href="/wiki/Denim" id="w">denim</a> seat covers, more comfortable seats (which concealed the same basic frame within), spoked wheels<sup id="_ref-clarke2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke2" title="">[6]</a></sup> and complex tubular bumpers (known as &#39;<a href="/wiki/Bullbar" id="w">roo bars</a>&#39;).<sup id="_ref-mokeclub_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mokeclub" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Australian Mokes were exported to many countries, and pioneered large-scale exports of Australian-made vehicles. Leyland Australia made much of these exports in its advertising. The use of Australian-made Mokes by the <a href="/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces" id="w">Israeli Army</a> (complete with a <a href="/wiki/Machine_gun" id="w">machine gun</a> tripod mounted in the rear) attracted controversy and media attention.<sup id="_ref-rees1_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rees1" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-clarke1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke1" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>From 1975, a <a href="/wiki/Pickup_truck" id="w">pickup</a> version of the Moke was produced, with a 1.45&#160;x&#160;1.50&#160;metre (55&#160;x&#160;59&#160;in) drop-sided <a href="/wiki/Pickup_truck#Pickup bed styles" id="w">bed</a> which protruded behind the back of the vehicle, and a cloth top over the cab area.<sup id="_ref-clarke2_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke2" title="">[6]</a></sup> At least two <a href="/wiki/Four-wheel_drive" id="w">four-wheel drive</a> Moke prototypes were manufactured by Leyland Australia in the late 1970s, but unlike the British &#39;Twini&#39; version, these used just one engine. Leyland were planning to market this version, but Moke production in Australia ended in 1981 and all that remains of the project is one of the prototypes which is now owned by an enthusiast in <a href="/wiki/Western_Australia" id="w">Western Australia</a> <sup id="_ref-clarke1_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke1" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-clarke2_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke2" title="">[6]</a></sup> and a modified differential crownwheel with gearteeth cut in the side to drive the rear tailshaft, in the personal collection of a <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" id="w">Melbourne</a> Mini specialist.</p>
<p>In 1977, a 1,275&#160;cc Cooper S-engined Moke (sponsored by <a href="/wiki/Coca-Cola" id="w">Coca-Cola</a>) was entered into the <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Airlines" id="w">Singapore Airlines</a> <a href="/wiki/London-Sydney_Marathon" id="w">London-Sydney Marathon</a>.

As Australian Moke production wound down, manufacturing was transferred to <a href="/wiki/British_Leyland_Motor_Corporation" id="w">British Leyland</a>&#39;s subsidiary in <a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portugal</a>, which made 8,500 of the &#39;Californian&#39; Mokes in their <a href="/wiki/Vendas_Novas" id="w">Vendas Novas</a> plant between 1980 and 1990. Initially these Mokes were identical to late model Australian Mokes; very soon, however, they were altered to use then-current British production Mini saloon components, including the standard-length Mini rear trailing arms and the 12&#160;in wheels with modern low-profile tyres, which the sedan had acquired during the Moke&#39;s absence from Europe.</p>
<p>In 1990, British Leyland (by then called <a href="/wiki/Austin_Rover_Group" id="w">Rover Group</a>) sold the &#39;Moke&#39; name to <a href="/wiki/Cagiva" id="w">Cagiva</a> - a <a href="/wiki/Motorcycle" id="w">motorcycle</a> manufacturer in <a href="/wiki/Bologna" id="w">Bologna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>. Production continued in Portugal until 1993, when Cagiva transferred the tooling to their factory in Italy with the intention of restarting production in 1995 - which they never did. Since Cagiva did not own the &#39;Mini&#39; name, the 1,500 cars they built were sold simply as &#39;Mokes&#39;.<sup id="_ref-rees1_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rees1" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-clarke1_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke1" title="">[5]</a></sup> This brought the total production run of Mokes and Moke derivatives to about 50,000.</p>

</p>
<p>The Moke&#39;s construction is simple. The <a href="/wiki/Car_body_style" id="w">body</a> mainly consists of two <a href="/wiki/Hollow_structural_section" id="w">box-section</a> &#39;pontoons&#39; or &#39;sideboxes&#39; running from the back of the car all the way up to the <a href="/wiki/Firewall_(construction)#Firewalls outside of building construction" id="w">firewall</a>. These are connected by the floor pan, the firewall and a sturdy torque box that runs under the front seats and stiffens the body in torsion. The left-hand pontoon contains the <a href="/wiki/Fuel_tank" id="w">fuel tank</a>; the right-hand has a compartment for the <a href="/wiki/Car_battery" id="w">battery</a> and a small lockable storage area. The 1972 &#34;Moke, Special Export&#34;, commonly referred to as a &#39;Californian&#39; Moke, has an <a href="/wiki/Austin_Sprite" id="w">Austin Sprite</a>/<a href="/wiki/MG_Midget" id="w">MG Midget</a> type fuel tank fitted beneath the rear floor area to meet the American <a href="/wiki/FMVSS" id="w">FMVSS</a> safety requirements of the time. Standard Mokes of the same period and later Californian Mokes use the conventional tank mounted in the left sidebox. Later Portuguese Mokes have additional lockable storage space at the rear of the vehicle. The optional cloth canopy has plastic side windows, and is held up by a thin tubular structure that can easily be removed when not needed. In later versions this was replaced with a more solid <a href="/wiki/Roll_cage" id="w">roll cage</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Windshield" id="w">windscreen</a> can easily be unbolted and removed if not needed. There are just three curved panels in the Moke, the <a href="/wiki/Hood_(vehicle)" id="w">bonnet</a>, the firewall and the floor, each of which is only curved in one direction. This makes it relatively straightforward to reproduce and replace Moke body components without access to sophisticated machine tools.<sup id="_ref-norman1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-norman1" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because the Moke&#39;s <a href="/wiki/BMC_A-Series_engine" id="w">A-Series engine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics)" id="w">gearbox</a> and <a href="/wiki/Suspension_(vehicle)" id="w">suspension</a> are identical to those of a standard Mini (which was still in production up to October 2000), most spare parts are still readily available. The Moke has no <a href="/wiki/Chassis" id="w">chassis</a>, so the wheels, <a href="/wiki/Brake" id="w">brake</a> assemblies and suspension are attached to front and rear <a href="/wiki/Subframe" id="w">subframes</a> which are bolted straight onto the <a href="/wiki/Monocoque" id="w">monocoque</a> shell just as with a standard Mini. Mokes tend to require much structural maintenance if they are to stay in good running order.<sup id="_ref-norman1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-norman1" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the early 1970s, a Mini Moke became the first motor vehicle to be driven on <a href="/wiki/Pitcairn_Islands" id="w">Pitcairn Island</a> and thereby became the most remote vehicle on earth. It was chosen because it was the only off-road vehicle that could be lifted by the island&#39;s only crane—there being no dock or airstrip at Pitcairn. However, the rough terrain and heavy rainfall proved too much for the Moke and it soon broke down. Eventually, a second and later a third Moke were sent to the island, and by cannibalising the three for spares, the island&#39;s sole vehicle remained running until at least 1988.<sup id="_ref-clarke2_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarke2" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
