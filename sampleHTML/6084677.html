<p>After Sekhar Kammula&#39;s first venture, <i>Dollar Dreams (2000)</i>, he began meeting producers with his stories. When he initially told them a story, they felt that it was too simple. Then, he began giving them a bound script of <i>Anand</i>. Unfortunately, none came forward to produce it. Upon someone&#39;s suggestion, Kammula approached <a href="/wiki/National_Film_Development_Corporation_of_India" id="w">National Film Development Corporation</a> (NFDC) and they came forward to fund a part of the project.<sup id="_ref-NFDC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NFDC" title="">[10]</a></sup> This set a precedent because it was the first time that NFDC entered into <a href="/wiki/Commercial" id="w">commercial</a> <a href="/wiki/Tollywood" id="w">Telugu cinema</a>.<sup id="_ref-Amigos_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Amigos" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>

 preferred actors who suit the roles than writing characters for established actors. Hence, the choice of the cast were non-established actors.<sup id="_ref-Happy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Happy" title="">[13]</a></sup> The search process lasted 3 months.<sup id="_ref-Interview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[14]</a></sup> The casting for Raja was simple. Kammula wanted someone without melodrama in acting and it just came as a plus when Raja appreciated Kammula&#39;s directorial abilities <sup id="_ref-Interview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[14]</a></sup>. The choice for an actress made Kammula visit <a href="/wiki/Mumbai" id="w">Mumbai</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bangalore" id="w">Bangalore</a>, but he could not get the appropriate one. On knowing about <a href="/wiki/Kamalinee_Mukherjee" id="w">Kamalinee Mukherjee</a>, he subjected her to a <a href="/wiki/Screen_test" id="w">screen test</a>.

So, these thoughts were quashed because the need was for a suitably big house and an <a href="/wiki/Outhouse" id="w">outhouse</a> situated adjacent to it. Since Kammula stayed in <i>Padmarao Nagar</i>, a prominent <a href="/wiki/Locality" id="w">locality</a> in Hyderabad, a location there made it all the more accessible for him.<sup id="_ref-Interview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Miscellaneous" name="Miscellaneous"></a><h3> Miscellaneous </h3>

<p>Kammula&#39;s primary inspiration came from the <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">Indian</a> <a href="/wiki/Middle_class" id="w">middle class</a>. He was of the thought that this section of people were wrongly represented in films. He wanted to represent them appropriately and this was achieved with <i>Anand</i>.<sup id="_ref-TotaltollywoodIntw_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TotaltollywoodIntw" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kammula sat with <a href="/wiki/Veturi" id="w">Veturi</a> for writing <a href="/wiki/Song" id="w">songs</a> for the film. Kammula said that he could see thousands of expressions expressed as a couple of words in lyrics. Eventually, they ended up with six beautiful <a href="/wiki/Song" id="w">songs</a> penned by Veturi. For <i>Anand</i>, Veturi took a month to come up with the <a href="/wiki/Lyric" id="w">lyrics</a> as against his usual penchant of coming up with lyrics spontaneously.<sup id="_ref-Interview_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Being a <a href="/wiki/Bengali_people" id="w">Bengali</a> <sup id="_ref-Kamalinee_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kamalinee" title="">[16]</a></sup>, there was a need for someone to <a href="/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)" id="w">dub</a>

<p>With most of the cast not well-versed in speaking <i><a href="/wiki/Telugu_language" id="w">Telugu</a></i>, Kammula faced challenges in their <a href="/wiki/Dialogue" id="w">dialogue</a> delivery.

Made with a modest budget of Rs. 15 million <sup id="_ref-IMDB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IMDB" title="">[19]</a></sup>, <i>Anand</i> was a refreshing movie of its time.
