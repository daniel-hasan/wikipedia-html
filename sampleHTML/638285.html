<a id="Cadbury" name="Cadbury"></a><h1>Cadbury</h1>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1879" id="w">1879</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Cadbury" id="w">George</a> and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Cadbury" id="w">Richard Cadbury</a> moved their <a href="/wiki/Cocoa" id="w">cocoa</a> and chocolate factory from Bridge Street in central Birmingham to a greenfield site beside Bournbrook Hall, four miles to the south. The location was chosen as it was regarded as cleaner, healthier and more amenable to longer-term expansion plans. Although rural, it was also already serviced by a <a href="/wiki/Railway" id="w">railway</a> station and <a href="/wiki/Canal" id="w">canal</a>.</p>
<p>The Cadburys named the area &#39;Bournville&#39; after the <a href="/wiki/Bourn_Brook" id="w">Bourn Brook</a>; with &#39;ville&#39; being French for &#39;town&#39;, this set Bournville apart from the local area (some people wrongly believe Bournville was originally known as Bournbrook - <a href="/wiki/Bournbrook" id="w">Bournbrook</a> exists to the north of Bournville). The Cadburys began to develop their factory in the new suburb. Loyal and hard-working workers were treated with great respect and relatively high wages and good working conditions; Cadbury also pioneered <a href="/wiki/Pension" id="w">pension</a> schemes, joint works committees and a full staff medical service. Indeed, the Cadburys were particularly concerned with the health of their workforce, incorporating garden areas into Bournville&#39;s plans, and encouraging <a href="/wiki/Swimming" id="w">swimming</a>, <a href="/wiki/Walking" id="w">walking</a> and all forms of outdoor sports.</p>
<p>Later, George Cadbury bought 120 acres (0.5 km²) of land close to the works and planned, at his own expense, a <a href="/wiki/Model_village" id="w">model village</a> which would &#39;alleviate the evils of modern more cramped living conditions&#39;. These almost &#39;<a href="/wiki/Arts_and_crafts" id="w">Arts and crafts</a>&#39; houses were traditional in design but with large gardens and modern interiors, and were designed by the resident <a href="/wiki/Architect" id="w">architect</a> <a href="/wiki/William_Alexander_Harvey" id="w">William Alexander Harvey</a>. These designs became a blueprint for many other model village estates around Britain. It is also noteworthy that, because George Cadbury was a <a href="/wiki/Quaker" id="w">Quaker</a>, no <a href="/wiki/Public_house" id="w">public houses</a> have ever been built in Bournville.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/1900" id="w">1900</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Bournville_Village_Trust" id="w">Bournville Village Trust</a> was set up to formally control the development of the estate, independently of George Cadbury or the estate. The trust focused on providing <a href="/wiki/School" id="w">schools</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hospital" id="w">hospitals</a>, <a href="/wiki/Museum" id="w">museums</a>, public baths and reading rooms. As Bournville is a conservation area, another job of the Bournville Village Trust is to accept or reject plans for building extension and modification.</p>
<p>An almost campus feel evolved, with a triangular village green, infant and junior schools, the School of Art and the Day Continuation School (originally intended for young Cadbury employees) and a host of events such as fêtes and <a href="/wiki/Maypole" id="w">Maypole</a> dances.</p>
<p>The trust continues to exercise an international influence on housing and town planning generally. Now containing 7,800 homes on 1,000 acres (4 km²) of land with 100 acres (0.4 km²) of parks and open spaces, Bournville remains a popular residential area of Birmingham.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cadbury_Schweppes" id="w">Cadbury Schweppes</a> is still one of Birmingham&#39;s main employers, making all manner of chocolate products.</p>
