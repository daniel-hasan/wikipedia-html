<p>As a political philosopher, Jefferson was a man of the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" id="w">Enlightenment</a> and knew many intellectual leaders in Britain and France. He idealized the independent <a href="/wiki/Yeoman#Yeoman farmers" id="w">yeoman farmer</a> as exemplar of republican virtues, distrusted cities and financiers, and favored states&#39; rights and a strictly limited federal government.   Jefferson supported the <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state" id="w">separation of church and state</a> and was the author of the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Statute_for_Religious_Freedom" id="w">Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom</a> (1779, 1786). He was the eponym of <a href="/wiki/Jeffersonian_democracy" id="w">Jeffersonian democracy</a> and the co-founder and leader of the <a href="/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party" id="w">Democratic-Republican Party</a>, which dominated <a href="/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States" id="w">American politics</a> for a quarter-century and was the precursor of the modern-day <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic Party</a>. Jefferson served as the wartime <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia" id="w">Governor of Virginia</a> (1779&#8211;1781), first <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State" id="w">United States Secretary of State</a> (1789&#8211;1793) and second <a href="/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States" id="w">Vice President</a> (1797&#8211;1801).</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Polymath" id="w">polymath</a>, Jefferson achieved distinction as, among other things, a <a href="/wiki/Horticulture" id="w">horticulturist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Statesman" id="w">statesman</a>, <a href="/wiki/Architect" id="w">architect</a>, <a href="/wiki/Archaeology" id="w">archaeologist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paleontology" id="w">paleontologist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Author" id="w">author</a>, <a href="/wiki/Inventor" id="w">inventor</a> and  founder of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Virginia#History" id="w">University of Virginia</a>. When President <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" id="w">John F.

<p>In 1752, Jefferson began attending a local school run by <a href="/wiki/William_Douglas" id="w">William Douglas</a>, a Scottish minister. At the age of nine, Jefferson began studying <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a>, and <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>. In 1757, when he was 14 years old, his father died.  Jefferson inherited about 5,000 acres (20 km²) of land and dozens of <a href="/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States" id="w">slaves</a>. He built his home there, which eventually became known as <a href="/wiki/Monticello" id="w">Monticello</a>.</p>
<p>After his father&#39;s death, he was taught at the school of the learned minister <a href="/wiki/James_Maury" id="w">James Maury</a> from 1758 to 1760.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The school was in Fredericksville Parish near <a href="/wiki/Gordonsville%2C_Virginia" id="w">Gordonsville</a>, <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a>, twelve miles (19 km) from <a href="/wiki/Shadwell_(Virginia)" id="w">Shadwell</a>, and Jefferson boarded with Maury&#39;s family. There he received a <a href="/wiki/Classical_education_movement" id="w">classical education</a> and studied history and science.</p>
<p>In 1760 Jefferson entered <a href="/wiki/The_College_of_William_%26amp%3B_Mary" id="w">The College of William &#38; Mary</a> in <a href="/wiki/Williamsburg%2C_Virginia" id="w">Williamsburg</a> at the age of 16; he studied there for two years, graduating with highest honors in 1762. At William &#38; Mary, he enrolled in the philosophy school and studied mathematics, <a href="/wiki/Metaphysics" id="w">metaphysics</a>, and philosophy under Professor <a href="/wiki/William_Small" id="w">William Small</a>, who introduced the enthusiastic Jefferson to the writings of the <a href="/wiki/Empiricism" id="w">British Empiricists</a>, including <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" id="w">John Locke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Francis_Bacon" id="w">Francis Bacon</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Newton" id="w">Isaac Newton</a> (Jefferson  called them the &#34;three greatest men the world had ever produced&#34;).<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> He also perfected his French, carried his Greek grammar book wherever he went, practiced the violin, and read <a href="/wiki/Tacitus" id="w">Tacitus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Homer" id="w">Homer</a>. A keen and diligent student, Jefferson displayed an avid curiosity in all fields and, according to the family tradition, frequently studied fifteen hours a day. His closest college friend, John Page of Rosewell, reported that Jefferson &#34;could tear himself away from his dearest friends to fly to his studies.&#34;</p>
<p>While in college, Jefferson was a member of a secret organization called the <a href="/wiki/Flat_Hat_Club" id="w">Flat Hat Club</a>, now the namesake of the William &#38; Mary student newspaper. He lodged and boarded at the College in the building known today as the Sir Christopher <a href="/wiki/Wren_Building" id="w">Wren Building</a>, attending communal meals in the Great Hall, and morning and evening prayers in the Wren Chapel. Jefferson often attended the lavish parties of royal governor <a href="/wiki/Francis_Fauquier" id="w">Francis Fauquier</a>, where he played his violin and developed an early love for wines.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/books/chapters/1203-1st-hail.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/books/chapters/1203-1st-hail.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/books/chapters/1203-1st-hail.html</a> After graduating in 1762 with highest honors, he studied law with his friend and mentor, <a href="/wiki/George_Wythe" id="w">George Wythe</a>, and was admitted to the <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a> bar in 1767.</p>
<p>In 1772, Jefferson married a 23-year-old widow, Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson. They had six children: Martha Jefferson Randolph (1772–1836), Jane Randolph (1774–1775), a stillborn or unnamed son (1777), Mary Wayles (1778–1804), Lucy Elizabeth (1780–1781), and Lucy Elizabeth (1782–1785). Martha died on <a href="/wiki/September_6" id="w">September 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1782" id="w">1782</a> and Jefferson never remarried. Jefferson may also have been the father of several children with his slave <a href="/wiki/Sally_Hemings" id="w">Sally Hemings</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Jefferson_DNA_data" id="w">Jefferson DNA data</a>).</p>

<a id="Colonial_legislator" name="Colonial_legislator"></a><h3>Colonial legislator</h3>
<p>Jefferson practiced law and served in the Virginia <a href="/wiki/House_of_Burgesses" id="w">House of Burgesses</a>. In 1774, he wrote, <a class="externallink" href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/jeffsumm.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/jeffsumm.htm">&#39;&#39;A Summary View of the Rights of British America&#39;&#39;</a> which was intended as instructions for the Virginia delegates to a national congress. The pamphlet was a powerful argument of American terms for a settlement with Britain. It helped speed the way to independence, and marked Jefferson as one of the most thoughtful patriot spokesmen.</p>
<a id="The_Second_Continental_Congress" name="The_Second_Continental_Congress"></a><h3>The Second Continental Congress</h3>
<p>In an uncanny twist of fate Richard Henry Lee, who authored the July 2, 1776 resolution declaring independence from Great Britain,  was called home to Virginia due to the illness of his wife.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Thomas Jefferson was appointed by  the <a href="/wiki/Continental_Congress" id="w">Continental Congress</a> of the United Colonies in his place as the <a href="/wiki/Committee_of_Five" id="w">Committee of Five</a>&#39;s Chairman  to prepare a draft of the proposed Declaration of Independence. Congress also chose <a href="/wiki/John_Adams" id="w">John Adams</a>, <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin" id="w">Benjamin Franklin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Livingston_(1746-1813)" id="w">Robert Livingston</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Roger_Sherman" id="w">Roger Sherman</a>. The committee assigned Thomas Jefferson the task of producing a draft Declaration for its consideration. Jefferson&#39;s creation of the original draft took place in seventeen days between his appointment on the committee until the report of draft to Congress on June 28, 1776. Jefferson drew heavily on George Mason&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Declaration_of_Rights" id="w">Virginia Declaration of Rights</a> (passed on June 12, 1776), state and local calls for independence, and his own work on the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Virginia" id="w">Virginia Constitution</a>. 26 changes were made from Jefferson&#39;s original draft by the Committee of Five.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  On July 4, 1776, the resolution was passed two days after Independence was declared.  Jefferson is considered to be the primary author.</p>
<a id="State_legislator" name="State_legislator"></a><h3>State legislator</h3>
<p>In September 1776, Jefferson returned to Virginia and was elected to the new <a href="/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Delegates" id="w">Virginia House of Delegates</a>. During his term in the House, Jefferson set out to reform and update Virginia&#39;s system of laws to reflect its new status as a democratic state. He drafted 126 bills in three years, including laws to abolish <a href="/wiki/Primogeniture" id="w">primogeniture</a>, establish <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_religion" id="w">freedom of religion</a>, and streamline the judicial system. In 1778, Jefferson&#39;s &#34;Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge&#34; led to several academic reforms at his <i>alma mater</i>, including an elective system of study &#8212; the first in an American university.</p>

<a id="Governor_of_Virginia" name="Governor_of_Virginia"></a><h3>Governor of Virginia</h3>
<p>Jefferson served as <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia" id="w">governor of Virginia</a> from 1779–1781. As governor, he oversaw the transfer of the state capitol from Williamsburg to the more central location of <a href="/wiki/Richmond%2C_Virginia" id="w">Richmond</a> in 1780. He continued to advocate educational reforms at the College of William and Mary, including the nation&#39;s first student-policed <a href="/wiki/Honor_code" id="w">honor code</a>. In 1779, at Jefferson&#39;s behest, William and Mary appointed <a href="/wiki/George_Wythe" id="w">George Wythe</a> to be the first professor of law in an American university. Dissatisfied with the rate of changes he wanted to push through, he later became the founder of the University of Virginia, which was the first university in the United States at which higher education was completely separate from religious doctrine.</p>
<p>Virginia was invaded twice by the British during Jefferson&#39;s term as governor. He, along with <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Henry" id="w">Patrick Henry</a> and other leaders of Virginia, were but ten minutes away from being captured by <a href="/wiki/Banastre_Tarleton" id="w">Banastre Tarleton</a>, a British colonel leading a cavalry column that was raiding the area in June 1781.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Public disapproval of his performance delayed his future political prospects, and he was never again elected to office in Virginia.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>Because Jefferson served as minister to <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> from 1785 to 1789, he was not able to attend the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Convention" id="w">Philadelphia Convention</a>. He generally supported the new constitution despite the lack of a <a href="/wiki/Bill_of_rights" id="w">bill of rights</a> and was kept informed by his correspondence with <a href="/wiki/James_Madison" id="w">James Madison</a>.</p>
<p>While in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a>, he lived in a residence on the <a href="/wiki/Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es" id="w">Champs-Élysées</a>.</p>
<a id="Secretary_of_State" name="Secretary_of_State"></a><h3>Secretary of State</h3>
<p>After returning from France, Jefferson served as the first Secretary of State under George Washington (1789–1793). Jefferson and <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton" id="w">Alexander Hamilton</a> began sparring over national <a href="/wiki/Fiscal_policy" id="w">fiscal policy</a>, especially the funding of the debts of the war, with Hamilton believing that the debts should be equally shared, and Jefferson believing that each state should be responsible for its own debt (Virginia had not accumulated much debt during the Revolution). In further sparring with the Federalists, Jefferson came to equate Hamilton and the rest of the Federalists with Tories and monarchists who threatened to undermine republicanism. He equated Federalism with &#34;Royalism,&#34; and made a point to state that &#34;Hamiltonians were panting after...and itching for crowns, coronets and mitres.&#34;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Jefferson and <a href="/wiki/James_Madison" id="w">James Madison</a> founded and led the Democratic-Republican Party. He worked with Madison and his campaign manager <a href="/wiki/John_J._Beckley" id="w">John J. Beckley</a> to build a nationwide network of Republican allies to combat Federalists across the country.</p>
<p>Jefferson strongly supported France against Britain when war broke out between those nations in 1793. Historian Lawrence S. Kaplan notes Jefferson&#39;s &#34;visceral support for the French cause,&#34; while agreeing with Washington that the nation should not get involved in the fighting.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The arrival in 1793 of an aggressive new French minister, <a href="/wiki/Edmond-Charles_Gen%C3%AAt" id="w">Edmond-Charles Genêt</a>, caused a crisis for the Secretary of State, as he watched Genêt try to violate American neutrality, manipulate public opinion, and even go over Washington&#39;s head in appealing to the people; projects that Jefferson helped to thwart. According to Schachner, Jefferson believed that political success at home depended on the success of the French army in Europe:<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

</p>
<dl><dd>Jefferson still clung to his sympathies with France and hoped for the success of her arms abroad and a cordial compact with her at home. He was afraid that any French reverses on the European battlefields would give &#34;wonderful vigor to our monocrats, and unquestionably affect the tone of administering our government. Indeed, I fear that if this summer should prove disastrous to the French, it will damp that energy of republicanism in our new Congress, from which I had hoped so much reformation.&#34;</dd></dl>
<a id="A_break_from_office" name="A_break_from_office"></a><h3>A break from office</h3>
<p>Jefferson at the end of 1793 retired to Monticello where he continued to orchestrate opposition to Hamilton and Washington. However, the <a href="/wiki/Jay_Treaty" id="w">Jay Treaty</a> of 1794, orchestrated by Hamilton, brought peace and trade with Britain &#8212; while Madison, with strong support from Jefferson, wanted, Miller says, &#34;to strangle the former mother country&#34; without actually going to war. &#34;It became an article of faith among Republicans that &#39;commercial weapons&#39; would suffice to bring Great Britain to any terms the United States chose to dictate.&#34; Jefferson, in retirement, strongly encouraged Madison.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>With the <a href="/wiki/Quasi-War" id="w">Quasi-War</a>, an undeclared naval war with France, underway, the <a href="/wiki/Federalist" id="w">Federalists</a> under John Adams started a navy, built up the army, levied new taxes, readied for war, and enacted the <a href="/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts" id="w">Alien and Sedition Acts</a> in 1798. Jefferson interpreted the Alien and Sedition Acts as an attack on his party more than on dangerous enemy aliens; they were used to attack his party, with the most notable attacks coming from <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Lyon" id="w">Matthew Lyon</a>, congressman of <a href="/wiki/Vermont" id="w">Vermont</a>. He and Madison rallied support by anonymously writing the <a href="/wiki/Kentucky_and_Virginia_Resolutions" id="w">Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions</a>, which declared that the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it by the states. The Resolutions meant that, should the federal government assume such powers, its acts under them could be voided by a state. The Resolutions presented the first statements of the <a href="/wiki/States%26%2339%3B_rights" id="w">states&#39; rights</a> theory, that later led to the concepts of <a href="/wiki/Nullification" id="w">nullification</a> and <a href="/wiki/Interposition" id="w">interposition</a>.</p>
<a id="The_election_of_1800" name="The_election_of_1800"></a><h3>The election of 1800</h3>
<p>Working closely with <a href="/wiki/Aaron_Burr" id="w">Aaron Burr</a> of New York, Jefferson rallied his party, attacking the new taxes especially, and <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1800" id="w">stood for the Presidency</a> in 1800. Consistent with the traditions of the times, he did not formally campaign for the position. Prior to the passage of the <a href="/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">12th Amendment</a>, a problem with the new union&#39;s electoral system arose.

<p>After lengthy debate within the Federalist-controlled House, Hamilton convinced his party that Jefferson would be a lesser political evil than Burr and that such scandal within the electoral process would undermine the still-young regime. The issue was resolved by the House, on <a href="/wiki/17_February" id="w">17 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1801" id="w">1801</a> after thirty-six ballots, when Jefferson was elected President and Burr Vice President.

<p>After leaving the Presidency, Jefferson continued to be active in public affairs. He also became increasingly concerned with founding a new institution of higher learning, specifically one free of church influences where students could specialize in <a href="/wiki/University_of_Virginia#History" id="w">many new areas</a> not offered at other universities.  Jefferson believed educating people was a good way to establish an organized society, and also felt schools should be paid for by the general public, so less wealthy people could obtain student membership as well <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>. A letter to <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Priestley" id="w">Joseph Priestley</a>, in January, 1800, indicated that he had been planning the University for decades before its establishment.</p>
<p>His dream was realized in 1819 with the founding of the University of Virginia. Upon its opening in 1825, it was then the first university to offer a full slate of elective courses to its students. One of the largest construction projects to that time in <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a>, it was notable for being centered about a library rather than a church. In fact, no campus chapel was included in his original plans. Until his death, Jefferson invited students and faculty of the school to his home; <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe" id="w">Edgar Allan Poe</a> was among those students.  </p>
<p>Jefferson is widely recognized for his architectural planning of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Virginia" id="w">UVA</a> campus, an innovative design that is a powerful representation of his aspirations for both state sponsored education and an agrarian democracy in the new Republic. His educational idea of creating  specialized units of learning is physically expressed in the configuration of his campus plan, which he called the &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Lawn" id="w">Academical Village</a>.&#34; Individual academic units are expressed visually as distinct structures, represented by Pavilions, facing a grassy quadrangle, with each Pavilion housing classroom, faculty office, and residences. Though unique, each is visually equal in importance, and they are linked together with a series of open air arcades that are the front facades of student accommodations. Gardens and vegetable plots are placed behind surrounded by <a href="/wiki/Serpentine_shape" id="w">serpentine</a> walls, affirming the importance of the agrarian lifestyle.</p>
<p>His highly ordered site plan establishes an ensemble of buildings surrounding a central rectangular quadrangle, named The Lawn, which is lined on either side with the academic teaching units and their linking arcades. The quad is enclosed at one end with the library, the repository of knowledge, at the head of the table. The remaining side opposite the library remained open-ended for future growth. The lawn rises gradually as a series of stepped terraces, each a few feet higher than the last, rising up to the library set in the most prominent position at the top, while also suggesting that the Academical Village facilitates easier movement to the future.</p>
<p>Stylistically, Jefferson was a proponent of the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" id="w">Greek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">Roman</a> styles, which he believed to be most representative of American democracy by historical association. Each academic unit is designed with a two story  temple front facing the quadrangle, while the library is modeled on the <a href="/wiki/Pantheon%2C_Rome" id="w">Roman Pantheon</a>. The ensemble of buildings surrounding the quad is an unmistakable architectural statement of the importance  of secular public education, while the exclusion of religious structures reinforces the principal of separation of church and state. The campus planning and architectural treatment remains today as a paradigm of the ordering of manmade structures to express intellectual ideas and aspirations. A survey of members of the <a href="/wiki/American_Institute_of_Architects" id="w">American Institute of Architects</a> identified Jefferson&#39;s campus as the most significant work of architecture in America.</p>
<p>The University was designed as the capstone of the educational system of Virginia. In his vision, any citizen of the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_(United_States)" id="w">commonwealth</a> could attend school with the sole criterion being ability.</p>

<p>Jefferson died on the <a href="/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)" id="w">Fourth of July</a>, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, the same day as John Adams&#39;s death. Although he was born into one of the wealthiest families in the United States, Thomas Jefferson was deeply in debt when he died. His possessions were sold at auction. In 1831, Jefferson&#39;s 552 acres (223 hectares) were sold for $7,000 to James T. Barclay. Thomas Jefferson is buried on his Monticello estate, in <a href="/wiki/Charlottesville%2C_Virginia" id="w">Charlottesville, Virginia</a>. In his will, he left Monticello to the United States to be used as a school for orphans of navy officers. His <a href="/wiki/Epitaph" id="w">epitaph</a>, written by him with an insistence that only his words and &#34;not a word more&#34; be inscribed, reads:

<p>Jefferson has been described by many people as a thin, tall man, who stood at approximately six feet and remarkably straight.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#34;The Sage of Monticello&#34; cultivated an image that earned him the other nickname, &#34;Man of the People.&#34; He affected a popular air by greeting White House guests in homespun attire like a robe and slippers. <a href="/wiki/Dolley_Madison" id="w">Dolley Madison</a>, wife of James Madison (Jefferson&#39;s secretary of state), and Jefferson&#39;s daughters relaxed White House protocol and turned formal state dinners into more casual and entertaining social events.<sup id="_ref-americanpresident.org_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-americanpresident.org" title="">[17]</a></sup> Although a foremost defender of a free press, Jefferson at times sparred with partisan newspapers and appealed to the people.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jefferson&#39;s writings were utilitarian and evidenced great intellect, and he had an affinity for languages. He learned <a href="/wiki/Irish_language" id="w">Gaelic</a> in order to translate <a href="/wiki/Ossian" id="w">Ossian</a>, and sent to <a href="/wiki/James_Macpherson" id="w">James Macpherson</a> for the originals.</p>
<p>As President, he discontinued the practice of delivering the <a href="/wiki/State_of_the_Union_Address" id="w">State of the Union Address</a> in person, instead sending the address to Congress in writing (the practice was eventually revived by <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" id="w">Woodrow Wilson</a>); he gave only two public speeches during his Presidency. Jefferson had a <a href="/wiki/Lisp" id="w">lisp</a><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> and preferred writing to public speaking partly because of this. He burned all of his letters between himself and his wife at her death, creating the portrait of a man who at times could be very private. Indeed, he preferred working in the privacy of his office than the public eye.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Interests_and_activities" name="Interests_and_activities"></a><h2>Interests and activities</h2>
<p>Jefferson was an accomplished <a href="/wiki/Architect" id="w">architect</a> who was extremely influential in bringing the <a href="/wiki/Palladian_architecture" id="w">Neo-Palladian</a> style&#8212;popular among the <a href="/wiki/British_Whig_Party" id="w">Whig</a> aristocracy of Britain&#8212;to the United States. The style was associated with Enlightenment ideas of <a href="/wiki/Republic" id="w">republican</a> civic virtue and political liberty. Jefferson designed his famous home, <a href="/wiki/Monticello" id="w">Monticello</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Charlottesville%2C_Virginia" id="w">Charlottesville</a>, <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a>; it included automatic doors, the first <a href="/wiki/Swivel_chair" id="w">swivel chair</a>, and other convenient devices invented by Jefferson. Nearby is the only university ever to have been founded by a U.S. president, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Virginia" id="w">University of Virginia</a>, of which the original <a href="/wiki/Curriculum" id="w">curriculum</a> and architecture Jefferson designed. Today, Monticello and the University of Virginia are together one of only four man-made <a href="/wiki/World_Heritage_Site" id="w">World Heritage Sites</a> in the United States of America. Jefferson also designed <a href="/wiki/Poplar_Forest" id="w">Poplar Forest</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Lynchburg%2C_Virginia" id="w">Lynchburg</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Bedford_County%2C_Virginia" id="w">Bedford County</a>, Virginia, as a private retreat from a very public life. Jefferson is also credited with the architectural design of the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_State_Capitol" id="w">Virginia State Capitol</a> building, which was modeled after the <a href="/wiki/Maison_Carr%C3%A9e" id="w">Maison Carrée</a> at Nîmes in southern France, an ancient <a href="/wiki/Roman_temple" id="w">Roman temple</a>. Jefferson&#39;s buildings helped initiate the ensuing American fashion for <a href="/wiki/Federal_architecture" id="w">Federal architecture</a>.</p>
<p>Jefferson&#39;s interests included archeology, a discipline then in its infancy. He has sometimes been called the <i>&#34;father of archeology&#34;</i> in recognition of his role in developing <a href="/wiki/Excavation" id="w">excavation</a> techniques. When exploring an <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Indian</a> burial mound on his Virginia estate in 1784, Jefferson avoided the common practice of simply digging downwards until something turned up. Instead, he cut a wedge out of the mound so that he could walk into it, look at the layers of occupation, and draw conclusions from them.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson enjoyed his fish pond at Monticello. It was around three feet (1 m) deep and mortar lined. He used the pond to keep fish that were recently caught as well as to keep eels fresh. This pond has been restored and can be seen from the west side of Monticello.</p>
<p>In 1780, he joined Benjamin Franklin&#39;s <a href="/wiki/American_Philosophical_Society" id="w">American Philosophical Society</a>. He served as president of the society from 1797 to 1815.</p>
<p>Jefferson was an avid <a href="/wiki/Wine" id="w">wine</a> lover and noted gourmet. During his years in <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> (1784–1789) he took extensive trips through French and other <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">European</a> wine regions and sent the best back home. He is noted for the bold pronouncement: &#34;We could in the United States make as great a variety of wines as are made in Europe, not exactly of the same kinds, but doubtless as good.&#34; While there were extensive vineyards planted at Monticello, a significant portion were of the European wine grape <i><a href="/wiki/Vitis_vinifera" id="w">Vitis vinifera</a></i> and did not survive the many vine diseases native to the Americas.</p>
<p>In 1801, he published <a class="externallink" href="http://www.constitution.org/tj/tj-mpp.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.constitution.org/tj/tj-mpp.htm">&#39;&#39;A Manual of Parliamentary Practice&#39;&#39;</a> that is still in use. In 1812 Jefferson published a second edition.</p>
<p>After the British burned Washington, D.C. and the <a href="/wiki/Library_of_Congress" id="w">Library of Congress</a> in August 1814, Jefferson offered his own collection to the nation. In January 1815, Congress accepted his offer, appropriating $23,950 for his 6,487 books, and the foundation was laid for a great national library. Today, the <a href="/wiki/Library_of_Congress" id="w">Library of Congress</a>&#39; website for federal legislative information is named THOMAS, in honor of Jefferson.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> His two-volume 1764 edition of the <a href="/wiki/Qur%26%2339%3Ban" id="w">Qur&#39;an</a> was used by <a href="/wiki/Keith_Ellison_(politician)" id="w">Rep.

<p>Jefferson was a leader in developing republicanism in the United States. He insisted that the British aristocratic system was inherently corrupt and that Americans&#39; devotion to civic virtue required independence. In the 1790s he repeatedly warned that Hamilton and Adams were trying to impose a British-like monarchical system that threatened republicanism. He supported the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812" id="w">War of 1812</a>, hoping it would drive away the British military and ideological threat from Canada. Jefferson&#39;s vision for American virtue was that of an agricultural nation of yeoman farmers minding their own affairs. It stood in contrast to the vision of Alexander Hamilton, who envisioned a nation of commerce and manufacturing, which Jefferson said offered too many temptations to corruption. Jefferson&#39;s deep belief in the uniqueness and the potential of America made him the father of <a href="/wiki/American_exceptionalism" id="w">American exceptionalism</a>. In particular, he was confident that an under-populated America could avoid what he considered the horrors of class-divided, industrialized Europe.</p>
<p>Jefferson&#39;s republican political principles were heavily influenced by the Country Party of 18th century British opposition writers. He was influenced by John Locke (particularly relating to the principle of inalienable rights). Historians find few traces of any influence by his French contemporary, <a href="/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" id="w">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>His opposition to the Bank of the United States was fierce: &#34;I sincerely believe, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale.&#34;<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Nevertheless Madison and Congress, seeing the financial chaos caused by the lack of a national bank in the War of 1812, disregarded his advice and created the <a href="/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States" id="w">Second Bank of the United States</a> in 1816.</p>
<p>Jefferson believed that each individual has &#34;certain inalienable rights.&#34; That is, these rights exist with or without government; man cannot create, take, or give them away. It is the right of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Liberty" id="w">liberty</a>&#34; on which Jefferson is most notable for expounding. He defines it by saying &#34;rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add &#39;within the limits of the law,&#39; because law is often but the tyrant’s will, and always so when it violates the rights of the individual.&#34;<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Hence, for Jefferson, though government cannot <i>create</i> a right to liberty, it can indeed violate it. And the limit of an individual&#39;s rightful liberty is not what law says it is but is simply a matter of stopping short of prohibiting other individuals from having the same liberty. A proper government, for Jefferson, is one that not only prohibits individuals in society from infringing on the liberty of other individuals, but also restrains <i>itself</i> from diminishing individual liberty.</p>
<p>Jefferson&#39;s commitment to equality was expressed in his successful efforts to abolish primogeniture in Virginia, the rule by which the first born son inherited all the land.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jefferson believed that individuals have an innate sense of <a href="/wiki/Morality" id="w">morality</a> that prescribes right from wrong when dealing with other individuals&#8212;that whether they choose to restrain themselves or not, they have an innate sense of the natural rights of others. He even believed that moral sense to be reliable enough that an <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" id="w">anarchist</a> society could function well, provided that it was reasonably small. On several occasions, he expressed admiration for <a href="/wiki/Tribe" id="w">tribal</a>, communal way of living of <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native Americans</a>:<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> In fact, Jefferson is sometimes seen as a <a href="/wiki/Philosophical_anarchism" id="w">philosophical anarchist</a>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>He said in a <i>letter to Colonel Carrington</i>: &#34;I am convinced that those societies (as the Indians) which live without government, enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under the European governments.&#34; However, Jefferson believed anarchism to be &#34;inconsistent with any great degree of population.&#34;<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Hence, he did advocate government for the American expanse provided that it exists by &#34;consent of the governed.&#34;</p>
<p>In the Preamble to his original draft of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson wrote:
{{Cquote}}</p>
<p>Jefferson&#39;s dedication to &#34;consent of the governed&#34; was so thorough that he believed that individuals could not be morally bound by the actions of preceding generations. This included debts as well as law. He said that &#34;no society can make a perpetual constitution or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs always to the living generation.&#34; He even calculated what he believed to be the proper cycle of legal revolution: &#34;Every constitution then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of nineteen years. If it is to be enforced longer, it is an act of force, and not of right.&#34; He arrived at nineteen years through calculations with expectancy of life tables, taking into account what he believed to be the age of &#34;maturity&#34;&#8212;when an individual is able to reason for himself.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> He also advocated that the <a href="/wiki/Government_debt" id="w">national debt</a> should be eliminated. He did not believe that living individuals had a moral obligation to repay the debts of previous generations. He said that repaying such debts was &#34;a question of generosity and not of right.&#34;<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jefferson&#39;s very strong defense of States&#39; rights, especially in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798, set the tone for hostility to expansion of federal powers.  However, some of his foreign policies did in fact strengthen the government. Most important was the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, when he used the implied powers to annex a huge foreign territory and all its French and Indian inhabitants. His enforcement of the <a href="/wiki/Embargo_Act_of_1807" id="w">Embargo Act of 1807</a>, while it failed in terms of foreign policy, demonstrated that the federal government could intervene with great force at the local level in controlling trade that might lead to war.</p>

<p>Trained as a lawyer, Jefferson was a great writer but never a good speaker or advocate and never comfortable in court.

<p>During the presidential campaign of 1800, the Federalists attacked Jefferson as an infidel, claiming that Jefferson&#39;s intoxication with the religious and political extremism of the French Revolution disqualified him from public office. But Jefferson wrote at length on religion and many scholars agree with the claim that Jefferson was a deist, a common position held by intellectuals in the late 18th century, at least for much of his life. As <a href="/wiki/Avery_Dulles" id="w">Avery Dulles</a>, a leading <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Catholic</a> theologian reports, &#34;In his college years at William and Mary [Jefferson] came to admire Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, and John Locke as three great paragons of wisdom. Under the influence of several professors he converted to the deist philosophy.&#34;<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Dulles concludes:

<p>Jefferson used deist terminology in repeatedly stating his belief in a <a href="/wiki/Creator_deity" id="w">creator</a>, and in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence" id="w">United States Declaration of Independence</a> used the terms &#34;Creator&#34; and &#34;Nature&#39;s God.&#34; Jefferson believed, furthermore, it was this Creator that endowed humanity with a number of inalienable rights, such as &#34;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#34; His experience in France just before the French Revolution made him deeply suspicious of Catholic priests and bishops as a force for reaction and ignorance. Similarly, his experience in America with inter-denominational intolerance served to reinforce this skeptical view of religion. In a letter to <a href="/wiki/William_Short_(American_ambassador)" id="w">Willam Short</a>, Jefferson wrote: &#34;the serious enemies are the priests of the different religious sects, to whose spells on the human mind its improvement is ominous.&#34;<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jefferson was raised in the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" id="w">Church of England</a>, at a time when it was the <a href="/wiki/State_religion" id="w">established church</a> in Virginia and only denomination funded by Virginia tax money. Before the Revolution, Jefferson was a <a href="/wiki/Vestryman" id="w">vestryman</a> in his local church, a lay position that was part of political office at the time. He also had friends who were clergy, and he supported some churches financially. During his Presidency, Jefferson attended the weekly church services held in the House of Representatives. Jefferson later expressed general agreement with his friend Joseph Priestley&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Unitarianism" id="w">Unitarianism</a>, that is the rejection of the doctrine of Trinity. In a letter to a pioneer in Ohio he wrote, &#34;I rejoice that in this blessed country of free inquiry and belief, which has surrendered its conscience to neither kings or priests, the genuine doctrine of only one God is reviving, and I trust that there is not a young man now living in the United States who will not die a Unitarian.&#34;<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jefferson did not believe in the divinity of Jesus, but he had high esteem for Jesus&#39; moral teachings, which he viewed as the &#34;principles of a pure deism, and juster notions of the attributes of God, to reform [prior Jewish] moral doctrines to the standard of reason, justice &#38; philanthropy, and to inculcate the belief of a future state.&#34;<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> Jefferson did not believe in miracles. He made his own condensed version of the Gospels, omitting Jesus&#39; virgin birth, miracles, divinity, and resurrection, primarily leaving only Jesus&#39; moral philosophy, of which he approved. This compilation was published after his death and became known as the <i><a href="/wiki/Jefferson_Bible" id="w">Jefferson Bible</a></i>.</p>

<p>However, early in his administration he attended church services in the House of Representatives.

<p>For Jefferson, separation of church and state was not an abstract right but a necessary reform of the religious &#34;tyranny&#34; of one Christian sect over many other Christians - and of the interference of the state in affairs of religion.</p>
<p>Following the Revolution, Jefferson played a leading role in the disestablishment of religion in Virginia. Previously the Anglican Church had tax support.  As he wrote in his <i>Notes on Virginia</i>, a law was in effect in Virginia that &#34;if a person brought up a Christian denies the being of a God, or the Trinity …he is punishable on the first offense by incapacity to hold any office …; on the second by a disability to sue, to take any gift or legacy …, and by three year&#39; imprisonment.&#34; Prospective officer-holders were required to swear that they did not believe in the central Roman Catholic doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Transubstantiation" id="w">transubstantiation</a>.</p>
<p>From 1784 to 1786, Jefferson and James Madison worked together to oppose <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Henry" id="w">Patrick Henry</a>&#39;s attempts to again assess taxes in Virginia to support churches. Instead, in 1786, the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly" id="w">Virginia General Assembly</a> passed Jefferson&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Statute_for_Religious_Freedom" id="w">&#39;&#39;Bill for Religious Freedom&#39;&#39;</a>, which he had first submitted in 1779 and was one of only three accomplishments he put in his own epitaph. The law read:
{{Cquote}}</p>
<p>In his 1787 <a class="externallink" href="http://www.lva.lib.va.us/whatwedo/k12/psd/colony/tjnotes.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.lva.lib.va.us/whatwedo/k12/psd/colony/tjnotes.htm">Notes on the State of Virginia</a>, Jefferson stated: &#34;Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this coercion? To make half the world fools and half hypocrites; to support roguery and error all over the world...&#34;</p>
<p>Jefferson sought what he called a &#34;wall of separation between Church and State,&#34; which he believed was a principle expressed by the <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">First Amendment</a>. This phrase has been cited several times by the Supreme Court in its interpretation of the <a href="/wiki/Establishment_Clause_of_the_First_Amendment" id="w">Establishment Clause</a>.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> In an 1802 letter to the <a href="/wiki/Danbury%2C_Connecticut" id="w">Danbury</a> <a href="/wiki/Baptist" id="w">Baptist</a> Association, he wrote:
{{Cquote}}</p>
<p>Jefferson refused to issue proclamations calling for days of prayer and thanksgiving during his Presidency, yet he did do so as Governor in Virginia. His private letters indicate he was skeptical of too much interference by <a href="/wiki/Clergy" id="w">clergy</a> in matters of civil government. His letters contain the following observations: &#34;History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government,&#34;<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> and, &#34;In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the <a href="/wiki/Despotism" id="w">despot</a>, abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own.&#34;<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> &#34;May it be to the world, what I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all), the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of self-government.&#34;<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> While opposed to the institutions of organized religion, Jefferson invoked the notion of divine justice in his opposition to slavery: &#34;Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with his wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just: that his justice can not sleep forever: that considering numbers, nature and natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange of situation is among possible events: that it may become probable by supernatural interference!&#34;<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>While the debate over Jefferson&#39;s understanding over the separation of Church and state is far from being settled, as are his particular religious tenets, his dependence on divine Providence is not nearly as ambiguous. As he stated, in his second inaugural address:

<p>Jefferson owned many slaves over his lifetime. Some find it baffling that Thomas Jefferson owned slaves yet was outspoken in saying that slavery was immoral and it should be abolished. Biographers point out that Jefferson was deep in debt and had encumbered his slaves by notes and mortgages; he chose not to free them until he finally was debt-free, which he never was.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> Jefferson seems to have suffered pangs and trials of conscience as a result.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> He wrote about slavery, &#34;We have the wolf by the ears; and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other.&#34;<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>During his long career in public office, Jefferson attempted numerous times to abolish or limit the advance of slavery. According to a biographer, Jefferson &#34;believed that it was the responsibility of the state and society to free all slaves.&#34;<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup>  In 1769, as a member of the House of Burgesses, Jefferson proposed for that body to emancipate slaves in Virginia, but he was unsuccessful.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> In his first draft of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson condemned the British crown for sponsoring the importation of slavery to the colonies, charging that the crown &#34;has waged cruel war against <a href="/wiki/Human_nature" id="w">human nature</a> itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating &#38; carrying them into slavery in another <a href="/wiki/Western_Hemisphere" id="w">hemisphere</a>.&#34; However, this language was dropped from the Declaration at the request of delegates from <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina" id="w">South Carolina</a> and <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)" id="w">Georgia</a>.</p>
<p>In 1778, the legislature passed a bill he proposed to ban further importation of slaves into Virginia; although this did not bring complete <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism" id="w">emancipation</a>, in his words, it &#34;stopped the increase of the evil by importation, leaving to future efforts its final eradication.&#34; In 1784, Jefferson&#39;s draft of what became the <a href="/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance" id="w">Northwest Ordinance</a> stipulated that &#34;there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude&#34; in any of the new states admitted to the Union from the <a href="/wiki/Northwest_Territory" id="w">Northwest Territory</a>.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup>  In 1807, he signed a bill abolishing the <a href="/wiki/History_of_slavery#Early United States law" id="w">slave trade</a>.

<p>In this same work, Jefferson advanced his suspicion that black people were inferior to white people &#34;in the endowments both of body and mind.&#34;<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup>  However, Jefferson did also write in this same that a black person could have the right to live free in any country where people judge them as just being good for labor as well<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> He also wrote, &#34;Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free. [But] the two races...cannot live in the same government. Nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them.&#34;<sup id="_ref-americanpresident.org_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-americanpresident.org" title="">[17]</a></sup> According to historian <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Ambrose" id="w">Stephen Ambrose</a>: &#34;Jefferson, like all slaveholders and many other white members of American society, regarded Negroes as inferior, childlike, untrustworthy and, of course, as property. Jefferson, the genius of politics, could see no way for African-Americans to live in society as free people.&#34;<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> His solution seems to have been for slaves to be freed then deported peacefully, failing which the same result would be imposed by war and that, in Jefferson&#39;s words, &#34;human nature must shudder at the prospect held up [by war]. We should in vain look for an example in the Spanish deportation or deletion of the Moors. This precedent [the Spanish deportation or deletion] would fall far short of our case.&#34;<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>

<p>The downturn in land prices after 1819 pushed Jefferson further into debt. Jefferson finally emancipated his five most trusted slaves; the others were sold after his death to pay his debts.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_Sally_Hemings_controversy" name="The_Sally_Hemings_controversy"></a><h4>The Sally Hemings controversy</h4>
<p>Regarding <a href="/wiki/Miscegenation" id="w">marriage between blacks and whites</a>, Jefferson wrote that &#34;[t]he amalgamation of whites with blacks produces a degradation to which no lover of his country, no lover of excellence in the human character, can innocently consent.&#34;<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> Whether Jefferson fathered children with Sally Hemings is the subject of considerable controversy since Jefferson is often believed to be the father of at least some of the children of his slave. In addition, Hemings was likely the half-sister of Jefferson&#39;s deceased wife Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson. The allegation that Jefferson fathered children with Hemings first gained widespread public attention in 1802, when controversial journalist <a href="/wiki/James_T._Callender" id="w">James T. Callender</a>, wrote in a Richmond newspaper, &#34;...[Jefferson] keeps and for many years has kept, as his <a href="/wiki/Concubinage" id="w">concubine</a>, one of his slaves. Her name is Sally.&#34; Jefferson never responded publicly about this issue but is said to have denied it in his private correspondence.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>A 1998 DNA study concluded that there was a DNA link between some of Hemings descendants and the Jefferson family, but it did not conclusively prove that Jefferson himself was their ancestor. Three studies were released in the early 2000s, following the publication of the DNA evidence. In 2000, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which runs Monticello, appointed a multi-disciplinary, nine-member in-house research committee of <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy" id="w">Ph.D.s</a> and an <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine" id="w">M.D.</a> to study the matter of the paternity of Hemings&#39;s children. The committee concluded &#34;it is very unlikely that any Jefferson other than Thomas Jefferson was the father of [Hemings&#39;s six] children.&#34;<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2001, the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> commissioned a study by an independent 13-member Scholars Commission. The commission concluded that the Jefferson paternity thesis was not persuasive. On April 12, 2001, they issued a report; at 565 pages, it was far longer than the Foundation report, though many of those pages were devoted to a review of the evidence that the Thomas Jefferson Foundation study examined. The conclusion of most of the Scholars Commission was that &#34;the Jefferson-Hemings allegation is by no means proven&#34;; those members&#39; individual conclusions ranged from &#34;serious skepticism about the charge&#34; to &#34;a conviction that it is almost certainly false.&#34; The majority suggested the most likely alternative is that <a href="/wiki/Randolph_Jefferson" id="w">Randolph Jefferson</a>, Thomas&#39;s younger brother, was the father of Eston.</p>
<p>The <i>National Genealogical Society Quarterly</i> then published articles reviewing the evidence from a genealogical perspective and concluded that the link between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings was valid.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>
