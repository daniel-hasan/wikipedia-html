<p><b><i>Colectivo</i></b> is the name given in <a href="/wiki/Argentina" id="w">Argentina</a> to public transportation vehicles, especially those of Argentina&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Capital" id="w">capital city</a>, <a href="/wiki/Buenos_Aires" id="w">Buenos Aires</a>. They represent one of the best-known traditions of the city. </p>
<p>When they first appeared in the <a href="/wiki/1920s" id="w">1920s</a>, <i>colectivos</i> were small <a href="/wiki/Bus" id="w">buses</a> built out of smaller vehicle chassis (cars, vans, etc.) and, later, out of truck chassis (1950&#8211;1990, by <a href="/wiki/Mercedes-Benz" id="w">Mercedes-Benz</a> Argentina). 
<i>Colectivos</i> used to be built on top of units not specifically designed for the transportation of people and were decorated with unique paintings <i>(<a href="/wiki/Fileteado" id="w">fileteado</a>)</i> that gave each unit a distinct flavor and added a colorful touch to Buenos Aires&#39; streets.</p>
<p>Their evolution and size growth was steady and they kept their own picturesque style until <a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a>, when the urban fleet was modernized with real Bus-Bus units (with motors in the back of the unit) and much of the charm was lost. </p>
<p>Together with <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">football</a>, urban landmarks (like the <a href="/wiki/Obelisk_of_Buenos_Aires" id="w">Buenos Aires Obelisk</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Tango_(dance)" id="w">tango</a>, the <i>colectivo</i> was, until the <a href="/wiki/1990s" id="w">1990s</a>, one of the big tourist draws of Buenos Aires. Because of its golden times the <i>colectivo</i> is loved by the citizens of Buenos Aires. A <i>colectivo</i> historian concluded after his extensive study:
</p><blockquote>

<p>The term <i>colectivo</i> came to be used in some neighbouring countries including <a href="/wiki/Paraguay" id="w">Paraguay</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/1900s" id="w">1900s</a> Argentina was the &#34;Granary of the World&#34;, one of the largest world food producers and exporters, and a wealthy country. The streets of prosperous Buenos Aires (with 2 million inhabitants) soon filled with cars.
Commercial relations with the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> (mainly trade in meat and grain), also brought a myriad of investors and enterprises in the early years of the century, including <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" id="w">Latin America</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Buenos_Aires_Metro" id="w">first metro system</a>, <a href="/wiki/Car" id="w">cars</a>, <a href="/wiki/Train" id="w">trains</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tram" id="w">tramways</a>, <a href="/wiki/Taxicab" id="w">taxis</a> and public buses.</p>

But in <a href="/wiki/1929" id="w">1929</a> the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">Great Depression</a> hit, and the local cab owners attempted a radical change. They modified their taxi units, widening the back seats to allow more than one passenger per trip, and established pre-defined itineraries and stops, at a lower price per passenger. Every day, the drivers deliberately challenged the &#34;real&#34; public buses and electrical tramways, parking near them at the busiest stations and driving close to them during the day to pick up their passengers. Soon people started to prefer these <i>colectivos</i> and the original buses and tramways became part of history. Thus the original Argentine <i>colectivo</i> was born.
With time, these routes were formalized and owners of individual units grouped into líneas (<i>lines</i>) that operated a particular route. Since several lines often shared avenues and roads, companies began to adopt different colors to distinguish their units and not depend only on their assigned numbers (up to 3 digits) because they were often hard to see in the crowded streets. The <a href="/wiki/Colectivo_60" id="w">Colectivo 60</a> was created in this era and, with it, a legend was born.</p>
<p>Popular demand in the <a href="/wiki/1930s" id="w">1930s</a> propelled the size of the <i>colectivo</i> from five to up to a dozen seats but the picturesque external chassis designs remained in the original styles, which were kept until the <a href="/wiki/1970s" id="w">1970s</a> and <a href="/wiki/1980s" id="w">1980s</a> (by which time the units had twenty seats).</p>

<p>After <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> and during the <a href="/wiki/1950s" id="w">1950s</a>, Argentine industry started to develop again but the country&#39;s public transport system was inadequate for the new era: practically no modernization had taken place since the early years, and the train system was inadequate to meet the rising demands of the population.</p>
<p>Mercedes-Benz then took up this novel idea and ran with it, forever shaping the history of the <i>colectivos</i>.  In <a href="/wiki/1951" id="w">1951</a> Mercedes-Benz set up in Argentina its first factories outside <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>: one in the town of <a href="/wiki/San_Mart%C3%ADn%2C_Buenos_Aires" id="w">San Martín</a>, near Buenos Aires, and another in <a href="/wiki/Gonz%C3%A1lez_Cat%C3%A1n" id="w">González Catán</a>. These began production of a large amount of trucks and cars, with their output soon rising to 600 units of trucks and also public transportation vehicles. 
In less than a decade the output was 6,500 units a year. Mercedes released updated local <i>colectivo</i> models (which were still just modified truck chassis), naming them Colectivo LO&#160;3500, 0P&#160;3500, L0&#160;311, L0&#160;312, etc. In <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a> Mercedes built the <b>10,000th <i>colectivo</i></b> (model LO&#160;312), and continued with other models, such as L&#160;1112 (120 <a href="/wiki/Horsepower" id="w">HP</a>), LA&#160;1112 (traction in all wheels), L&#160;1114, etc.</p>
<p>All the lines progressively adopted these units and, between 1950 and 1990, all the <i>colectivos</i> on the street eventually became Mercedes-Benz models.</p>

<p>The last truck-Bus <i>colectivo</i> was the chassis LO-1114, from Mercedes-Benz. </p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1987" id="w">1987</a> &#34;El Detalle&#34;, one of the subsidiaries of Mercedes-Benz, started competing with its parent company, investing in low price and modern urban buses, with cheaper <a href="/wiki/Deutz_AG" id="w">Deutz</a> motors. That same year, its model A-101 was launched. This model was rear-engined and had <a href="/wiki/Pneumatic" id="w">pneumatic</a> suspension, allowing for smoother rides and more inside space.   
Mercedes-Benz responded the following year with the OH-1314 but that was considered &#34;the death of the colectivo&#34; <a class="externallink" href="http://www.busarg.com.ar/evolucion.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.busarg.com.ar/evolucion.htm">http://www.busarg.com.ar/evolucion.htm</a>, certainly the end of an era.</p>  
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1989" id="w">1989</a> the last units on the classic chassis LO-1114 were mounted. Production had been discontinued the previous year. During the 1990s, some companies found it cheaper to switch to single colored units, and a flurry of mergers and foldings changed the way the colectivos look.</p>  
<p>Nowadays, only the three-digit numbering survives from the traditional old &#34;líneas&#34;, <i>fileteado</i> is rare and scarce, the <i>filigranas</i> were lost, and some of the classic big details, like the long mirrors close to the driver&#39;s head, simply disappeared.</p>
<p>After 1995 automatic ticket machines were added, they added safety to journeys since the drivers did not have to sell tickets and drive at the same time.</p>
<p>As of <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, Mercedes-Benz units account only for about half of the buses in the city of Buenos Aires and its surroundings, with units built in <a href="/wiki/Rosario" id="w">Rosario</a> (<i>Eivar</i>, Eiroa-Varela) and in <a href="/wiki/Brazil" id="w">Brazil</a> (<i>MarcoPolo</i> and others). The other half are <i>El Detalle</i> units.</p>
<p>Most older units have been retired from service in Buenos Aires, as they are considered too dangerous and noisy for use in the fast-paced city. They were disposed of or sent to smaller cities all over the country. Colectivos are usually disposed of only when they are too damaged to be repaired and some of them have “resuscitated” as fine motorhomes.</p>
<a id="Description_of_the_''Colectivo''" name="Description_of_the_''Colectivo''"></a><h1>Description of the &#39;&#39;Colectivo&#39;&#39;</h1>
<p>The Mercedes units were more sophisticated than the original <i>taxi-bus</i> but the body kept its artistic touches, preserving the original style of the <i>colectivo</i>. This style was not influenced by the social class of the districts through which the <i>colectivos</i> journeyed. All the units of all the <i>&#34;líneas&#34;</i> shared these characteristics until the 1990s: 
</p><a id="Multi-colored_units" name="Multi-colored_units"></a><h2>Multi-colored units</h2>

<p>Decorators used many colorful combinations over the units&#39; external body, helping identify each one of the <i>líneas</i>. These eventually evolved into &#34;corporate colors&#34;, meaning that when on occasion two or more lines were bought by the same company, units of different lines were painted in the same colors. Until the 1990s, the <i>fileteado</i> was kept nonetheless in spirit with the uniqueness of each individual bus.</p>
<a id="''Fileteados''" name="''Fileteados''"></a><h2>&#39;&#39;Fileteados&#39;&#39;</h2>

<p><i><a href="/wiki/Fileteado" id="w">Fileteado</a></i> was defined as: &#34;art on wheels: full of colored ornaments and symmetries completed with poetic phrases, sayings and aphorisms, both humorous or roguish, emotional or philosophical&#34; <a class="externallink" href="http://www.martinianoarce.com/#english" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.martinianoarce.com/#english">http://www.martinianoarce.com/#english</a>.
The  <i>colectivos</i> were where this art found its best &#34;canvas&#34;. Long, wide mirrors placed around the driver seat often had winding drawings and motifs that usually portrayed the driver&#39;s preferences in <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">football</a>, <a href="/wiki/Religion" id="w">religion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tango_music" id="w">tango</a>. 
The outside of the units was also painted with <i>fileteado</i> details, flower motifs, <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Argentina" id="w">national flags</a>, and football team flags. It was also very common to see phrases written down in complex fonts, usually in the back. These phrases were often ingenious <a href="/wiki/Puns" id="w">puns</a> or rhymes and became part of Argentine folklore. A simple example of a very common phrase is: <i>Lo mejor que hizo la vieja es el pibe que maneja</i> (&#34;The best thing my old woman did was the lad who&#39;s driving&#34;).</p>
<a id="Fares" name="Fares"></a><h1>Fares</h1>

<p>Most buses share a basic fare system which is cheap but tiring when making transfers which works similar to the <a href="/wiki/Honour_System" id="w">Honour System</a> of Fares. The &#34;universal&#34; fare (in pesos) is:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Argentine_Peso" id="w">ARS</a> 0.75 (Around USD 0.25) for less than 15 blocks</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Argentine_Peso" id="w">ARS</a> 0.80 (Around USD 0.28) for the whole city of Buenos Aires. </li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Argentine_Peso" id="w">ARS</a> 1.25 (Around USD 0.42) for Buenos Aires Greater urban area or if travelling on an expressway. </li></ul>
<p>These fares are on a per bus basis, and are not valid for stopovers.</p>
<a id="Other_details" name="Other_details"></a><h2>Other details</h2>

<p>The units with a larger budget had more details added around the driver&#39;s seat. These usually came in the form of lights of exotic colors or seat covers with wool and fringes or even leather. It was very common to see the gear-stick full of hanging <a href="/wiki/Knickknack" id="w">knickknacks</a> and the casing where the tickets and coins were stored covered with motifs.</p>
<a id="Argentine_culture" name="Argentine_culture"></a><h1> Argentine culture </h1>

<p>The cultural roots of &#34;porteños&#34; (inhabitants of the city Buenos Aires) placed the <i>Colectivo</i> for many years as one of their distinctive icons, together with the <i>Obelisco</i> in Buenos Aires and the fanaticism for football.  
For example, the makers of the <a href="/wiki/1979_in_film" id="w">1979</a> motion picture <i>La fiesta de todos</i> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.cinenacional.com/peliculas/index.php?pelicula=791" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cinenacional.com/peliculas/index.php?pelicula=791">http://www.cinenacional.com/peliculas/index.php?pelicula=791</a>, after Argentina&#39;s victory in the <a href="/wiki/1978_FIFA_World_Cup" id="w">1978 FIFA World Cup</a> were forced by the military government to film one of its key stories inside a <i>colectivo</i>.  
One of Argentina&#39;s best-remembered <a href="/wiki/Soap_opera" id="w">soap operas</a> was called <i>Un mundo de 20 asientos</i> (&#34;A 20-seat world&#34;) and its main character was a <i>colectivero</i> (colectivo driver).</p>
<p>With the cultural explosion in Argentina from the 1980s, in films and intellectual endeavors, <i>colectivos</i> became one of the best-known examples of mass transport in the <a href="/wiki/Western_World" id="w">Western World</a>, similar to <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Double-decker" id="w">double-decker</a> buses or the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_subway" id="w">New York City subway</a>.</p>
<a id="Usage_in_Buenos_Aires" name="Usage_in_Buenos_Aires"></a><h1> Usage in Buenos Aires </h1>
<p>The frequency of the <i>colectivos</i> in the city of Buenos Aires makes them equal to the subway systems of other cities, but on wheels. However, buses cover a far wider area than the subway system, which is limited to a small (though the most active) part of the city.</p>
<p>With very affordable ticket prices and extensive routes, usually not further than four blocks from folks residences, the colectivo is by far the preferred mode of transportation around the city. &#34;Porteños&#34; have a love-hate relationship with the <i>colectivo</i>. On one side, they tend to be very crowded in <a href="/wiki/Rush_hour" id="w">rush hour</a> and are a haven for <a href="/wiki/Pickpocketing" id="w">pickpockets</a> and petty <a href="/wiki/Theft" id="w">thieves</a>. <a href="/wiki/Begging" id="w">Beggars</a> and itinerant salesmen hawk on board. On the other hand, they are a loved necessity in the city and a convenient and cheap way to get around.</p>
<a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h1> Trivia </h1>

<ul>
<li>Domestically, the colectivo is also called <b><i>bondi</i></b>; the word comes from the name of <a href="/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" id="w">Rio de Janeiro</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Tram" id="w">tramways</a> (<i>bondes</i>), in turn from <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> <i>bonds</i>, which is how the government paid for the Rio tramway system to the British company that built it.</li>
<li>Tickets are called <b><i>boletos</i></b>. Before <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a>, they were sold by the <i>colectivero</i> himself, and consisted of multi-colored strips of paper, with a 5-digit numeration. Palindromic numbers (such as <i>10301</i>, <i>29692</i>, <i>12321</i>) were called <i>capicúas</i> (from <a href="/wiki/Catalan_language" id="w">Catalan</a> <i>cap i cúa</i>, &#34;head and tail&#34;) and were traditionally conserved by the user as <a href="/wiki/Luck" id="w">lucky</a> charms.</li>
<li>Most colectivos in big cities of Argentina do not have a fixed timetable, but run from 4 to several per hour, depending on the bus line and time of the day.</li></ul>
