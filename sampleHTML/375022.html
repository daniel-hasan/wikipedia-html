To face the &#34;enemies of the world&#34;, the <i><a href="/wiki/Shinigami" id="w">shinigami</a></i> Boogiepop automatically rises to the surface.  In Boogiepop&#39;s world, the Towa Organization, a shadowy group seeking to control humanity, managed to capture an alien organism who had taken the form of a <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">highly-evolved</a> human.  By studying him, the Towa Organization was able to create synthetic humans, people who have been artificially enhanced with special abilities.  The mission of the Towa Organization and its agents is to find and kill MPLS, people who are more evolved than others and possess special abilities.   However, Boogiepop will not let the Towa Organization get its way and he is not alone in his efforts.</p>
<p>The Boogiepop series is very much about the characters: their relationships, their pasts, their memories.  This is especially true for how their pasts moulded them into the people they are today.  It can also be seen through scenes being presented from the perspective of different characters, and how the individual casts a different &#34;feel&#34; by how they relate to events.<sup id="_ref-bpdvd1com_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bpdvd1com" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Another important theme is change.

The <a href="/wiki/Shinigami" id="w">shinigami</a> whispered of among the female students of Shinyo Academy, few people know that Boogiepop actually exists.  Normally dormant, Boogiepop rises to the surface when enemies of the world appear.  Boogiepop&#39;s appearance and voice are ambiguous: they seem both masculine and feminine at the same time.  However, hidden beneath his signature black cloak and black, pipe-shaped hat, little is ever seen of him.  Straight-faced and to the point, Boogiepop acts as mechanical as he claims to be.  Boogiepop speaks in an archaic manner, and seems fond of whistling the overture to <a href="/wiki/Wagner" id="w">Wagner&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Die_Meistersinger_von_N%C3%BCrnberg" id="w">Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg</a></i>.</p>

<div class="caption">An illustration of Kirima Nagi by Kouji Ogata, from the Boogiepop and Others light novel</div></div>

Known as the Fire Witch to many, Kirima has made few friends due the way she distances herself from others: she knows that she is too dangerous for &#39;normal&#39; people to associate with.  She has a <a href="/wiki/Messianic_complex" id="w">messianic complex</a>, and seeks to save the world from whatever may threaten it.  As such, whenever there are unusual happenings within the city, Kirima can be found investigating what has happened.  In the past, she had spent a period of time in hospital.  A combination of the events from that period of her life, as well as the death of her father, the famous writer Kirima Seiichi, brought her to follow this path in life.  Extremely gifted both physically and intellectually, she has the basic tools she needs to carry out her self-appointed mission.</p>

An ordinary, happy school girl at Shinyo Academy, Miyashita is in love with her boyfriend, Takeda Keiji, and close friends with Suema Kazuko.  Not particularly good at school, she does not stand out in any way.  Unknown to most, she was hospitalized as a child, and this saw her life change, though even Miyashita herself does not seem to know the truth of what happened, and was simply told that she had been possessed by a <a href="/wiki/Kitsune" id="w">kitsune</a>.  Unknowingly, when the world is in trouble, she carries a Spalding sports bag containing the effects of Boogiepop, her <a href="/wiki/Disassociative_identity_disorder" id="w">alternate personality</a>.  She has no recollection of her time as Boogiepop, and alters her memories to explain the blanks.</p>

As a result of a childhood trauma, Suema has developed an unusual fascination with <a href="/wiki/Criminal_psychology" id="w">criminal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Abnormal_psychology" id="w">abnormal psychology</a>, as well as the desire to not let anything occur around her without her knowing.  As a result of this, she desperately seeks the truth about the unexplained events happening in her city, and meddles with forces best left untouched.  Good friends with Miyashita Touka, Suema appreciates how she so open and unconditionally accepting of her, and looks out for her friend.  She seeks to be closer with Kirima Nagi, who seems to know the answers to the questions that have haunted her all these years.</p>

Having already gained a strong readership among High School and University age men, the release of <i><a href="/wiki/Boogiepop_Returns:_VS_Imaginator_Part_1" id="w">Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1</a></i> was met with overwhelming support.  By the time the <i>Boogiepop and Others</i> film was released, the Boogiepop series was a bestseller, with over 2 million copies in print.<sup id="_ref-baohob_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baohob" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Reviews" name="Reviews"></a><h2>Reviews</h2>
<p>The Boogiepop series has received high praise from critics.  <i>Boogiepop Phantom</i> has received the most exposure, where it is often compared to <i><a href="/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain" id="w">Serial Experiments Lain</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Paranoia_Agent" id="w">Paranoia Agent</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-ultimate2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ultimate2" title="">[16]</a></sup>  It has been noted that the series is &#34;not your average anime&#34;, and one that &#34;demands your attention&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ntusabprev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ntusabprev" title="">[17]</a></sup>  While the fine detail the animators went into with the visuals has received much praise, bland character designs have been noted as one of the series&#39; flaws, though &#34;astute viewers may notice some rather interesting [...] differences between the various characters.&#34;<sup id="_ref-annev1rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-annev1rev" title="">[18]</a></sup>  The soundtrack has received much acclaim, not only for the <a href="/wiki/Background_music" id="w">background music</a> and <a href="/wiki/Voice_actor" id="w">voice actor</a> performances, but also the detail that went into the <a href="/wiki/Sound_effects" id="w">sound effects</a>.<sup id="_ref-aodvdbprev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aodvdbprev" title="">[19]</a></sup>  The presentation of the storyline was well received, but it was acknowledged that not everyone would be interested in following the subtle clues in each episode.<sup id="_ref-thembprev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thembprev" title="">[20]</a></sup>  A common complaint, however, is that there are many loose ends, mainly relating to the back-story,<sup id="_ref-sfbprev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sfbprev" title="">[21]</a></sup> leaving the series &#34;with more questions than answers&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ntusabprev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ntusabprev" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Far less critiqued, the <i>Boogiepop and Others</i> film fares less well than its sequel.  Whilst the characters and plot were well received, the <a href="/wiki/Special_effects" id="w">special effects</a> and costumes have been described as &#34;campy&#34;, but &#34;par for the course of something of this level and budget&#34;.<sup id="_ref-aodvdborev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aodvdborev" title="">[22]</a></sup>  The movie is, however, cited as being easier to watch, and is recommended to fans of the anime, so as to gain &#34;a complete understanding of the Boogiepop events&#34;.<sup id="_ref-mementoborev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mementoborev" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>Boogiepop and Others</i> novel has received more favorable reviews, though these have mostly focused on the translation, which has been cited as &#34;a standard against which future Japanese novel translations are judged&#34;.<sup id="_ref-annbonrev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-annbonrev" title="">[24]</a></sup>  It has also received praise for ripping &#34;the rules of narrative wide open&#34;,<sup id="_ref-rtobonrev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rtobonrev" title="">[25]</a></sup> especially for how it allows the characters to grow on the reader.<sup id="_ref-aodvdbonrev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aodvdbonrev" title="">[26]</a></sup>  <i>Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1</i> continues receiving positive feedback for its easy-to-read style and excellent translation, as well as its use of atmosphere and characters.  The main flaw, however, is the briefness of the title, which has clearly been used to set-up the sequel.<sup id="_ref-annbr1rev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-annbr1rev" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Boogiepop Doesn&#39;t Laugh</i> has received generally favourable reviews, particularly for capturing some of the more complicated scenes better than the original light novel.  This makes the plot easier to follow, and captures the urgency of the climactic battle.<sup id="_ref-rtobdl2rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rtobdl2rev" title="">[27]</a></sup>  However, it has been noted that breaking the complicated plot of <i>Boogiepop and Others</i> into a multi-volume manga results in individually weak volumes.<sup id="_ref-rtobdl1rev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rtobdl1rev" title="">[28]</a></sup>  As with <i>Boogiepop Phantom</i>, the character designs have been noted as &#34;lookalike and nondescript&#34;, which can make some of the events difficult to follow.  The art has also been described as &#34;washed out and dull&#34;.<sup id="_ref-rtobdl2rev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rtobdl2rev" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
