<b>The Great Shamokin Path</b> (also known as the &#34;Shamokin Path&#34;) was a major <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native American</a> <a href="/wiki/Trail" id="w">trail</a> in the <a href="/wiki/U.S._State" id="w">U.S. State</a> of <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a> that ran from the <a href="/wiki/Saponi_village_of_Shamokin" id="w">Saponi village of Shamokin</a> (modern day <a href="/wiki/Sunbury%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Sunbury</a>) along the <a href="/wiki/Left_bank" id="w">left bank</a> of the <a href="/wiki/West_Branch_Susquehanna_River" id="w">West Branch Susquehanna River</a> north and then west to the Great Island (near modern day <a href="/wiki/Lock_Haven%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Lock Haven</a>). There it left the river and continued further west to Chinklacamoose (what is now the borough of <a href="/wiki/Clearfield" id="w">Clearfield</a>) and finally <a href="/wiki/Kittanning" id="w">Kittanning</a>. It was once the <a href="/wiki/Rural_Valley_Railroad" id="w">Rural Valley Railroad</a>. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.armstrongcounty.com/hiking.php" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.armstrongcounty.com/hiking.php">http://www.armstrongcounty.com/hiking.php</a> The 6.76 miles of abandoned rail corridor had a budget of $60,000 for its conversion to a hiking, biking and equestrian trail. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.dep.state.pa.us/DEP/DEPUTATE/POLYCOMM/UPDATE/05-26-00/05260023.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.dep.state.pa.us/DEP/DEPUTATE/POLYCOMM/UPDATE/05-26-00/05260023.htm">http://www.dep.state.pa.us/DEP/DEPUTATE/POLYCOMM/UPDATE/05-26-00/05260023.htm</a></p>
<p>The Great Shamokin Path connected the <a href="/wiki/Susquehanna_River" id="w">Susquehanna River</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Allegheny_River" id="w">Allegheny River</a> (and the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_River" id="w">Ohio River</a> downstream of Kittanning). For several decades in the early 1700s the villages of Shamokin and Kittanning were two of the most important Native American villages in Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>Perhaps the path&#39;s best known use was by <a href="/wiki/Moravian_Church" id="w">Moravian</a> <a href="/wiki/Bishop" id="w">Bishop</a> Ettwein and his group of some 200 <a href="/wiki/Lenape" id="w">Lenape</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mohican" id="w">Mohican</a> <a href="/wiki/Christian" id="w">Christians</a> in 1772. They traveled west along the path from their village of Friedensh√ºtten (<i>Cabins of Peace</i>) near modern <a href="/wiki/Wyalusing%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Wyalusing</a> on the North Branch of the Susquehanna to their new village of Friedensstadt (<i>City of Peace</i>) on the <a href="/wiki/Beaver_River" id="w">Beaver River</a> in southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
<a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h1>Geography</h1>
<p>The village of Shamokin was just south of the &#34;forks of the Susquehanna&#34;, the <a href="/wiki/Confluence_(geography)" id="w">confluence</a> of the West Branch Susquehanna River with the <a href="/wiki/Susquehanna_River" id="w">Susquehanna River</a> (also known as the North Branch). From there, the Great Shamokin Path headed north and <a href="/wiki/Ford_(crossing)" id="w">forded</a> the river to current <a href="/wiki/Northumberland%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Northumberland</a>, then went along the left bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River to the <a href="/wiki/Shawnee" id="w">Shawnee</a> town of Chillisquaque on <a href="/wiki/Chillisquaque_Creek" id="w">Chillisquaque Creek</a>. The path continued north through what are now <a href="/wiki/Milton%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Milton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Watsontown%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Watsontown</a>, where the path forked into two branches, both leading to Canaserage on <a href="/wiki/Muncy_Creek" id="w">Muncy Creek</a> (today <a href="/wiki/Muncy%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Muncy</a>). </p>
<p>At Canaserage the river and path turned west, but there were at least two other paths that led northeast: the <a href="/wiki/Wyalusing_Path" id="w">Wyalusing Path</a> (along Muncy Creek to <a href="/wiki/Wyalusing%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Wyalusing</a>); and the <a href="/wiki/Towanda_Path" id="w">Towanda Path</a> (to <a href="/wiki/Towanda%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Towanda</a>), both on the North Branch of the Susquehanna River.</p>
<p>The Great Shamokin Path led west to the village of Otstonwakin (now <a href="/wiki/Montoursville%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Montoursville</a>) on <a href="/wiki/Loyalsock_Creek" id="w">Loyalsock Creek</a> and then to French Margaret&#39;s Town (now western <a href="/wiki/Williamsport%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Williamsport</a>) on <a href="/wiki/Lycoming_Creek" id="w">Lycoming Creek</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Sheshequin_Path" id="w">Sheshequin Path</a> led north along Lycoming Creek to Sheshequin (now <a href="/wiki/Ulster%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Ulster</a>) on the North Branch Susuqhehanna River. Further west the path went through the village of Quenashawakee, forded <a href="/wiki/Larrys_Creek" id="w">Larrys Creek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pine_Creek_(Pennsylvania)" id="w">Pine Creek</a> and came to the Great Island, (now just east of <a href="/wiki/Lock_Haven%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Lock Haven</a>).</p>
<p>The Great Island was an important crossroads with paths leading in many directions. The Great Shamokin Path left the river here (which turns north) to continue west along <a href="/wiki/Bald_Eagle_Creek_(West_Branch_Susquehanna_River)" id="w">Bald Eagle Creek</a>, fording Beech Creek and following Marsh Creek and Little Marsh Creek to its end. Then it climbed the <a href="/wiki/Allegheny_Front" id="w">Allegheny Front</a> to modern day <a href="/wiki/Snow_Shoe%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Show Shoe</a> and on to Moshannon, where there were two branches possible to Kylertown. The branches differed in their fords of <a href="/wiki/Black_Moshannon_Creek" id="w">Black Moshannon Creek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Moshannon_Creek" id="w">Moshannon Creek</a>, both of which were difficult to cross. From Kylertown the path continued west, fording <a href="/wiki/Clearfield_Creek" id="w">Clearfield Creek</a> before reaching Chinklacamoose (now <a href="/wiki/Clearfield%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Clearfield</a>).</p>
<p>At Chinklacamoose the Great Shamokin Path rejoined the West Branch Susquehanna River and followed it west seven miles to <a href="/wiki/Curwensville%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Curwensville, Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anderson_Creek" id="w">Anderson Creek</a>. Several crossings of the Susquehanna were needed to avoid thickets of <a href="/wiki/Mountain_laurel" id="w">mountain laurel</a> bushes here. The path then followed Anderson Creek a few miles, left it to go west to what is now Chestnut Grove, and then on to the Big Spring (now Luthersburg). There Mead&#39;s Path left to go northwest to <a href="/wiki/Venango%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Venango</a>, while the Great Shamokin Path ran southwest and followed tributaries of and <a href="/wiki/Mahoning_Creek" id="w">Mahoning Creek</a> to <a href="/wiki/Punxsutawney%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Punxsutawney</a>. Here the path&#39;s course is less clear, but it left Mahoning Creek to eventually follow <a href="/wiki/Cowanshannock_Creek" id="w">Cowanshannock Creek</a> to Kittanning and the Allegheny River.<sup id="_ref-path_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-path" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
