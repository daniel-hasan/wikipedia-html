<p>Ivan Wilzig is the son of the late Siegbert (Siggi) Wilzig (died in January 2003), who as a penniless German <a href="/wiki/Holocaust" id="w">Holocaust</a> survivor earned a fortune through finance. (59 of Ivan Wilzig&#39;s relatives were killed during the Holocaust.)  Ivan was born in <a href="/wiki/Newark%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Newark</a> and grew up in <a href="/wiki/Clifton%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Clifton</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a> as the oldest of the Wilzig children. He has a brother Alan and sister Sherry.</p>
<p>Wilzig began voice lessons as a teenager, but was discouraged by his father, who wanted his son to have a more successful career.  However, his mother describes him as a &#34;natural performer&#34; with a particular love for comic books  â€” especially <a href="/wiki/Captain_Marvel" id="w">Captain Marvel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Superman" id="w">Superman</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Batman" id="w">Batman</a>.</p>
<p>Ivan Wilzig graduated from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania" id="w">University of Pennsylvania</a>, earning a degree in European intellectual history.  He then earned his law degree at the Cardozo School of Law at <a href="/wiki/Yeshiva_University" id="w">Yeshiva University</a>.  He and his brother, Alan Wilzig, assisted his father in running the Trust Company Bank of New Jersey.  Most of Ivan Wilzig&#39;s work at the bank was in public relations and marketing; he tried one year as a corporate lawyer but hated it.

<a id="Peaceman" name="Peaceman"></a><h1>Peaceman</h1>

<p>In 2000 &#34;Sir Ivan&#34; abandoned his banking career to begin a career in music. (He sat on the board of the Trust Company Bank as of 2001, finally leaving in 2004.)  Wilzig began to release techno remixes of 1960s singles such as &#34;Imagine&#34;, &#34;San Francisco&#34; and &#34;Peace on Earth&#34;.  He formed the charitable Peaceman Foundation, which gives the proceeds of his records to charity.</p>
<p>As the spokesman for the Peaceman Foundation, the flamboyant Wilzig began to dress as a caped character named Peaceman.  Wilzig states that he was motivated to &#34;become&#34; Peaceman from <a href="/wiki/Suicide_bombing" id="w">suicide bombings</a> in <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israel</a> and the events of <a href="/wiki/September_11th_attacks" id="w">September 11, 2001</a>.  &#34;Then the world finally woke up and realized that evil is evil, and that there is right and wrong, and there are the bad guys versus the good guys,&#34; said Wilzig.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Wilzig describes his music as &#34;techno&#34; produced tracks with &#34;<a href="/wiki/Hippie" id="w">hippie</a>&#34; lyrics. He describes it as &#34;Technippy&#34;.  &#34;Imagine&#34;, &#34;San Francisco&#34; and &#34;Peace on Earth&#34; were produced by Grammy-nominee <a href="/wiki/Ernie_Lake" id="w">Ernie Lake</a>.  His newest song, &#34;For What It&#39;s Worth&#34;, was produced by FORD.</p>
<a id="Mr._Mitzvah" name="Mr._Mitzvah"></a><h1>Mr. Mitzvah</h1>
<p>During the first season of <i><a href="/wiki/Who_Wants_to_be_a_Superhero%3F" id="w">Who Wants to be a Superhero?</a></i>, Wilzig attempted to audition with the producers as Peaceman, but he was too late to be included.  He was encouraged to audition for the next season.</p>
<p>His &#34;Peaceman&#34; character made the cut for <a href="/wiki/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Superhero%3F_(Season_2)" id="w">Season Two</a>, but as a precondition, the <a href="/wiki/Sci_Fi_Channel_(United_States)" id="w">Sci Fi Channel</a> and NBC obtain the trademarks to contestant characters.  Wilzig refused to give up the trademark to &#34;Peaceman&#34; and attempted to create a new character &#34;<a href="/wiki/Mitzvah" id="w">Mitzvah</a> Man&#34;, but the name had already been trademarked.  &#34;Mr. Mitzvah&#34;, however, was not trademarked, and Wilzig took on the identity of Mr. Mitzvah for the show.</p>
<p>He was eliminated in the third episode.</p>
