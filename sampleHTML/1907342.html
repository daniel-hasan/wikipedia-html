<b>Jever</b> ({{IPA2}}, the pronunciation {{IPA}} is also often heard from non-locals) is the capital of the district of <a href="/wiki/Friesland_(district)" id="w">Friesland</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lower_Saxony" id="w">Lower Saxony</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>. The name Jever is usually associated with a major brand of beer which is produced here.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1> History </h1>
<p>Archeologic evidence suggests that Jever had been a settlement of the <a href="/wiki/Chauci" id="w">Chauci</a> in Roman times. In the <a href="/wiki/9th_century" id="w">9th century</a>, Jever and he rest of Rüstringen county was given to the newly-christianised Danish Lord Hariold by <a href="/wiki/Louis_the_Pious" id="w">Louis the Pious</a>. In the Middle-Ages, Jever, which was then known as <i>Geverae</i> (meaning &#34;grassland&#34;, or, in a different sense, &#34;place of the <a href="/wiki/Thing_(assembly)" id="w">Thing</a>&#34;) was handed to the dukes of <a href="/wiki/Saxony" id="w">Saxony</a>, then the <a href="/wiki/Welf" id="w">Welfs</a> and to <a href="/wiki/Oldenburg_(state)" id="w">Oldenburg</a>. A text from the <a href="/wiki/13th_century" id="w">13th century</a> suggests that the region&#39;s people finally were allowed to elect their chieftains themselves. Jever was granted <a href="/wiki/Town_privileges" id="w">town privileges</a> in the early <a href="/wiki/14th_century" id="w">14th century</a>.</p>
<p>Even though the seaport did not exist after the middle-ages, Jever remained a prospering, politically independent site of trade and commerce, attracting merchants and pirates alike, e. g. the <a href="/wiki/Victual_Brothers" id="w">Victual Brothers</a>. Only after the death of the last chieftain of the Jever territory, Edo Wiemken the Younger, who died in 1511,  Jever fell to <a href="/wiki/Graf" id="w">Graf</a> Edzard the Great of <a href="/wiki/East_Frisia" id="w">East Frisia</a> for a short while before being released into independence again under the rule of Maria (Froiken Maria = Miss Maria), Edo&#39;s daughter.</p>
<p>She died in 1575 and her death was kept secret for fear of a return of the East Frisians. Instead, Jever became one of Oldenburg&#39;s territories by last will of Maria. It was later passed to the House of Anhalt-Zerbst. After prince Friedrich August, who had supported the English in the American Revolutionary War for financial reasons, died in 1793, Anhalt-Zerbst perished and its territories were split. Interestingly, Jever was given to <a href="/wiki/Catherine_II_of_Russia" id="w">Catherine II of Russia</a> and remained Russian until <a href="/wiki/Napoleon" id="w">Napoleon</a>&#39;s armies occupied it in 1807. Between 1808 and 1810 it was part of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Holland" id="w">Kingdom of Holland</a>, a Napoleonic vassal state. When the French were forced to withdraw in 1813, Russia regained possession of Jever and returned it to the grand dukes of Oldenburg in 1818.</p>
<p>Because the Anhalt-Zerbst had guaranteed for their security and freedom of business, Jever became a center of Jewish life in Frisia, which reached its peak in the late 19th century, after which many youngsters left for the larger cities where they hoped to find better economic chances (and since the 1920s also in escape of growing anti-semitism). This caused the community to shrink to only half of its former size: In 1933, there were only 98 Jews left in Jever. The synagogue (inauguration 1802) was completely destroyed in the <a href="/wiki/Night_of_Broken_Glass" id="w">Night of Broken Glass</a>, at least 63 Jever Jews were killed in the <a href="/wiki/Holocaust" id="w">Holocaust</a>.</p>
