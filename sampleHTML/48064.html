<p><b><i>Sesame Street</i></b> is an <a href="/wiki/Television_in_the_United_States" id="w">American</a> educational <a href="/wiki/Children%26%2339%3Bs_television_series" id="w">children&#39;s television series</a> for <a href="/wiki/Nursery_school" id="w">preschoolers</a> and is a pioneer of the contemporary educational television standard, combining both <a href="/wiki/Edutainment" id="w">education and entertainment</a>. <i>Sesame Street</i> is well known for its <a href="/wiki/The_Muppets" id="w">Muppet</a> characters created by <a href="/wiki/Jim_Henson" id="w">Jim Henson</a>. As of 2007, 4,160 episodes of the show<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> have been produced in 38 seasons.  <i>Sesame Street</i> is one of the <a href="/wiki/List_of_longest_running_U.S._television_series" id="w">longest-running U.S. television shows</a> in <a href="/wiki/History_of_television" id="w">history</a>.</p>
<p><i>Sesame Street</i> is produced in the United States by the non-profit organization <a href="/wiki/Sesame_Workshop" id="w">Sesame Workshop</a>, formerly known as the <a href="/wiki/Children%26%2339%3Bs_Television_Workshop" id="w">Children&#39;s Television Workshop</a> (CTW), founded by <a href="/wiki/Joan_Ganz_Cooney" id="w">Joan Ganz Cooney</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Rogers" id="w">Ralph Rogers</a>. It premiered on <a href="/wiki/November_10" id="w">November 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a>, on the <a href="/wiki/National_Educational_Television" id="w">National Educational Television</a> network, and later that year it was moved to NET&#39;s replacement, the <a href="/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service" id="w">Public Broadcasting Service</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of its positive influence, <i>Sesame Street</i> is one of the most highly regarded educational shows for children in the world.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> No other television series has matched its level of international recognition and success. The original series has been televised in 120 <a href="/wiki/Country" id="w">countries</a>,<sup id="_ref-presskit_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-presskit" title="">[3]</a></sup> and more than 30 international versions have been produced, not including <a href="/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)" id="w">dubbed</a> versions. The series has received 109 <a href="/wiki/Emmy_Awards" id="w">Emmy Awards</a>, more than any other television series.<sup id="_ref-presskit_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-presskit" title="">[3]</a></sup> An estimated 76 million Americans have watched the series as children;<sup id="_ref-washingtonfile2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-washingtonfile2" title="">[4]</a></sup> millions more have watched around the world, as have their parents.</p>
<a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a><h1> Overview </h1>
<p>Sesame Street uses combinations of <a href="/wiki/Puppet" id="w">puppets</a>, animation, and live actors to stimulate young children&#39;s minds to improve their letter and word recognition, basic mathematics (numbers, addition and subtraction), as well as geometric forms, and classification. Since the show&#39;s inception, other instructional goals have been basic life skills, such as how to cross the street safely, proper hygiene, healthy eating habits, and social skills.</p>
<p>The show displays a subtle sense of humour that has appealed to older viewers since it first premiered; this was devised as a means to encourage parents and older siblings to watch the series with younger children, thus becoming involved in the learning process, rather than having <i>Sesame Street</i> act as a <a href="/wiki/Babysitter" id="w">babysitter</a>. A number of parodies of popular culture appear, especially ones aimed at the <a href="/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service" id="w">Public Broadcasting Service</a>, the network that broadcasts the show. For example, the recurring segment <a href="/wiki/Monsterpiece_Theatre" id="w">Monsterpiece Theatre</a> once ran a sketch called &#34;Me Claudius&#34;. Children viewing the show might enjoy watching <a href="/wiki/Cookie_Monster" id="w">Cookie Monster</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Muppets" id="w">the Muppets</a>, while adults watching the same sequence may enjoy the spoof of the <i><a href="/wiki/Masterpiece_Theatre" id="w">Masterpiece Theatre</a></i> showing of <i><a href="/wiki/I%2C_Claudius_(TV_series)" id="w">I, Claudius</a></i> on PBS.

<p>Over two hundred notable personalities have made guest appearances on the show, beginning with <a href="/wiki/Carol_Burnett" id="w">Carol Burnett</a> on the first episode, and ranging from performers like <a href="/wiki/James_Brown" id="w">James Brown</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Goo_Goo_Dolls" id="w">The Goo Goo Dolls</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Johnny_Cash" id="w">Johnny Cash</a>, to political figures such as <a href="/wiki/Laura_Bush" id="w">Laura Bush</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kofi_Annan" id="w">Kofi Annan</a>.<sup id="_ref-washingtonfile1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-washingtonfile1" title="">[5]</a></sup>  (See <a href="/wiki/List_of_celebrity_guest_stars_on_Sesame_Street" id="w">List of celebrity guest stars on Sesame Street</a>.)  By making a show that not only educates and entertains kids, but also keeps parents entertained and involved in the educational process, the producers hope to inspire discussion about the concepts on the show.</p>
<p>In 1999, the series became the longest running American children&#39;s program, taking the title from <i><a href="/wiki/Captain_Kangaroo" id="w">Captain Kangaroo</a></i>. The British series <i><a href="/wiki/Blue_Peter" id="w">Blue Peter</a></i> still retains the worldwide record.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> The series has made many published lists, including greatest all-time show compilations by <i><a href="/wiki/TV_Guide" id="w">TV Guide</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" id="w">Entertainment Weekly</a></i>. Nielsen Media Research has found that 99% of American preschoolers recognise the series&#39; characters.<sup id="_ref-sslpress_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sslpress" title="">[7]</a></sup> Another study** found that 81% of kids under the age of six own a <i>Sesame Street</i> toy or game, and 87% own a book based on the series.<sup id="_ref-sslpress_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sslpress" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>{{main}}
The show&#39;s format called for the humans to be intermixed with the segments of animation, live-action shorts and <a href="/wiki/The_Muppets" id="w">Muppets</a>. These segments were created to be like commercials—quick, catchy and memorable—and made the learning experience much more like fun. The format became a model for what is known today as <a href="/wiki/Edutainment" id="w">edutainment</a>-based programming.</p>
<p>CTW aired the program for test groups to determine if the revolutionary new format was likely to succeed. Results showed that test watchers were entranced when the ad-like segments aired, especially those with the jovial puppets, but were remarkably less interested in the street scenes. Psychologists warned CTW against a mixture of fantasy and reality elements, but producers soon decided to mix the elements. A simple dose of cartoon-like characters lets the humans deliver messages without causing viewers to lose interest.<sup id="_ref-unpaved_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-unpaved" title="">[9]</a></sup> Prior to its national debut, a week of test episodes were seen in July 1969 on <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Philadelphia</a> educational station WUHY-TV (now <a href="/wiki/WYBE" id="w">WYBE</a>).<a class="externallink" href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Sesame_Street_Test_Show_1" rel="nofollow" title="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Sesame_Street_Test_Show_1">http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Sesame_Street_Test_Show_1</a></p>
<p><i>Sesame Street</i>, along with several other <a href="/wiki/Sesame_Workshop" id="w">Sesame Workshop</a>-produced shows (such as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Electric_Company" id="w">The Electric Company</a></i>, which was produced for six seasons, when Sesame Workshop was still known as CTW) were all taped in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>. Originally they were shot at the <a href="/wiki/Teletape_Studios" id="w">Teletape Studios</a> at West 81st Street and Broadway in Manhattan, but to make room for the incoming production of <i>Search For Tomorrow</i>, <i>Sesame Street</i> moved first to another Manhattan studio that was formerly WNET&#39;s <i>Dick Cavett</i> studio at 9th Ave. and 55th St in 1982.  With the bankruptcy of Teletape&#39;s parent company Reeves Entertainment in 1986, operation of <i>Sesame Street<b>s studio was taken over by Unitel Video NY in that year.  In 1992, the production moved again to <a href="/wiki/Kaufman_Astoria_Studios" id="w">Kaufman Astoria Studios</a> in neighboring <a href="/wiki/Queens" id="w">Queens</a> where it is to this day.</b></i></p>
<p>The brownstone architecture of <i>Sesame Street</i>, a fictional <a href="/wiki/Neighborhood" id="w">neighborhood</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>, as well as the concept of neighbors from different backgrounds living in the same area and sharing their life experiences, was loosely based on <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights" id="w">Brooklyn Heights</a>, Brooklyn—where several of the founding producers were living at the time.</p>
<a id="Broadcast_history" name="Broadcast_history"></a><h1>Broadcast history</h1>
<p>The show is broadcast worldwide; in addition to the U.S. version, many countries have locally-produced versions adapted to local needs, some with their own characters, and in a variety of different languages. In <a href="/wiki/Television_in_Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, beginning in 1970, 15-minute shows called <i>Canada&#39;s Sesame Street</i> were broadcast, and by 1972 an edited version of the one-hour American program was airing but with specially filmed Canadian segments, which featured the <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French language</a>. In 1995 the American version was replaced by a half-hour long all-Canadian version of the series entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Sesame_Park" id="w">Sesame Park</a></i>. Since the original <i>Sesame Street</i> was still accessible to Canadians, and more familiar, the format change didn&#39;t find acceptance with audiences and was taken off the air in 2002. Broadcasts in <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a> and <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> began in 1971. </p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> its introduction was controversial. The <a href="/wiki/ITV" id="w">ITV</a> network company <a href="/wiki/London_Weekend_Television" id="w">London Weekend Television</a> first showed the series in the <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> region in the early 1970s to much criticism (generally regarding its <i>Americanism</i>). In time the show was subsequently broadcast by other <a href="/wiki/ITV" id="w">ITV</a> regions in the early 1980s, after which it moved to <a href="/wiki/Channel_4" id="w">Channel 4</a>, where it was a lunch-time fixture for many years through to the early 2000s. Later broadcasts of the show featured the hour-long episodes in a format of two half-hour episodes. 120 countries have aired the show, many of which partnered with Sesame Workshop to create local versions.</p>
<p>In recent years <i>Sesame Street</i> has made what area educators consider to be critical advances in its international versions. In the late 1990s versions appeared in <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> and <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a> as these countries shifted away from communism. There is also a joint <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israeli</a>-<a href="/wiki/Palestinian" id="w">Palestinian</a>-<a href="/wiki/Jordan" id="w">Jordanian</a> project, called <i>Sesame Stories</i>, which was created with the goal of promoting greater cultural understanding.</p>
<p>The show has also spawned the spin-off series <i><a href="/wiki/Play_with_Me_Sesame" id="w">Play with Me Sesame</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/ESL" id="w">ESL</a> program <i><a href="/wiki/Sesame_English" id="w">Sesame English</a></i>, the &#34;classics&#34; show <i><a href="/wiki/Sesame_Street_Unpaved" id="w">Sesame Street Unpaved</a></i>, and the segment-only series <i><a href="/wiki/Open_Sesame" id="w">Open Sesame</a></i>. <i><a href="/wiki/Elmo%26%2339%3Bs_World" id="w">Elmo&#39;s World</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Global_Grover" id="w">Global Grover</a></i>, both of which are segments of <i>Sesame Street</i>, have been distributed as individual series. Jennifer Monier-Williams, Vice President, Worldwide Television Distribution at Sesame Workshop commented &#34;The expansion of the <i>Sesame</i> brand through wonderfully interactive shows like <i>Play With Me Sesame</i> and <i>Elmo&#39;s World</i> give children around the globe new ways to experience fun and learning in the way Sesame does it best.&#34;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Funding" name="Funding"></a><h2>Funding</h2>

<p>Funding for season 38 of <i>Sesame Street</i> is provided by a <a href="/wiki/Ready_To_Learn" id="w">Ready To Learn</a> grant in partnership with <a href="/wiki/New_Balance" id="w">New Balance</a>, the <a href="/wiki/McDonald%26%2339%3Bs_Corporation" id="w">McDonald&#39;s Corporation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beaches_Family_Resorts" id="w">Beaches Family Resorts</a>, and EverydayKidz.com from <a href="/wiki/Astra_Zeneca" id="w">Astra Zeneca</a>. Major funding for <i>Sesame Street</i> is provided by <a href="/wiki/The_Corporation_for_Public_Broadcasting" id="w">The Corporation for Public Broadcasting</a> (did not fund from 1972–1992, or from 1998–2000) and by contributions to PBS stations from &#34;<a href="/wiki/Viewers_Like_You" id="w">Viewers Like You</a>.&#34; Previous donors of funding for <i>Sesame Street</i> included <a href="/wiki/Chuck_E._Cheese%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">Chuck E. Cheese&#39;s</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Foundation" id="w">Ford Foundation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Discovery_Zone" id="w">Discovery Zone</a> , <a href="/wiki/Pfizer" id="w">Pfizer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quaker_Oats_Company" id="w">Quaker Oats Company</a>, <a href="/wiki/LookSmart" id="w">LookSmart</a>, <a href="/wiki/AOL" id="w">AOL</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education" id="w">U.S. Department of Education</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Carnegie_Corporation_of_New_York" id="w">Carnegie Corporation of New York</a>. </p>
<p>During the first 29 seasons, <i>Sesame Street</i> did not show its underwriting credits at the start of the show. Other CTW productions, such as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Electric_Company" id="w">The Electric Company</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/3-2-1_Contact" id="w">3-2-1 Contact</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Square_One_Television" id="w">Square One Television</a></i>, also limited underwriting announcements to the end of the show, unlike most PBS series, where they opened and closed each episode.</p>
<p>Occasionally, local businesses and organizations fund local telecasts of <i>Sesame Street</i> on PBS stations throughout the U.S. For example, the <a href="/wiki/W._M._Keck_Foundation" id="w">W. M. Keck Foundation</a> underwrites the broadcast of Sesame Street on <a href="/wiki/KCET" id="w">KCET</a> in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Within the context of the show, and before the actual underwriting announcements, it is announced that &#34;Sesame Street is brought to you by&#34; the letters and number of the day, as though they too were sponsors.</p>
<a id="Ratings" name="Ratings"></a><h2>Ratings</h2>
<p>As a result of its success in revolutionizing the standards of children&#39;s television, <i>Sesame Street</i> inadvertently diminished its own audience share. According to PBS Research, the show went from a 2.0 average on <a href="/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research" id="w">Nielsen Media Research</a>&#39;s &#34;people meters&#34; in 1995–1996 to a 1.3 average in 2000–2001. Even with this decrease, <i>Sesame Street<b>s viewership in an average week came from roughly 5.6 million households with 7.5 million viewers. This placed <i>Sesame</i> at 8th place in the overall kids&#39; charts, as of 2002. The program fares better among mothers age 18–49 who had children under the age of 3, taking second place.</b></i></p>
<p>A format change helped the show&#39;s ratings, boosting them up 31% in February 2002 among children age 2–5, in comparison to its ratings in 2001. As of 2005, <i>Sesame Street</i> and three other PBS shows are in the top 10 shows for children ages 2 to 5.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> As of season 36 in 2005, there were 8 million viewers daily.<sup id="_ref-presskit_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-presskit" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Sesame Street</i> is known for its <a href="/wiki/Multiculturalism" id="w">multicultural</a> element and is inclusive in its casting, incorporating roles for disabled people, young people, senior citizens, Hispanic actors, Black actors, and others. While some of the puppets look like people, others are animal or &#34;monster&#34; puppets of different sizes and colors. This encourages children to believe that people come in all different shapes, sizes, and colors, and that no particular physical &#34;type&#34; is any better than another. Jim Henson commented that &#34;The only kids who can identify along racial lines with the Muppets have to be either green or orange.&#34;<sup id="_ref-all_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-all" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In harmony with its multiculturalist perspective, the show pioneered the idea of occasionally inserting very basic Spanish words and phrases to help young children become acquainted with the concept of a foreign language, doing so almost three decades before <a href="/wiki/Dora_the_Explorer" id="w">Dora the Explorer</a> made her debut on <a href="/wiki/Nickelodeon_(TV_channel)" id="w">Nickelodeon</a>. Perhaps in response to the popularity of Dora, the recently revamped format gives <a href="/wiki/Rosita%2C_la_Monstrua_de_las_Cuevas" id="w">Rosita</a>, the bilingual muppet who &#34;emigrated&#34; in 1993 from the Mexican version of the show, more time in front of viewers, and also introduced the more formalized &#34;Spanish Word of the Day&#34; in every episode.</p>
<p>Each of the puppet characters has been designed to represent a specific stage or element of early childhood, and the scripts are written so that the character reflects the development level of children of that age. This helps the show address not only the learning objectives of various age groups, but also the concerns, fears, and interests of children of different age levels.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Big_Bird" id="w">Big Bird</a> is an 8 ft 2-inch (250cm) tall yellow bird who lives in a large nest on an abandoned lot which is located in 123 Sesame Street&#39;s garbage heap. Big Bird is often visited by his friend <a href="/wiki/Aloysius_Snuffleupagus" id="w">Aloysius Snuffleupagus</a>, who is a very large, brown creature, which looks very much like the prehistoric wooly mammoth, and is known more popularly by his nickname &#34;Snuffy&#34;. Various other Snuffleupaguses have appeared on the show from time to time, most notably Snuffy&#39;s little sister Alice and his unnamed mother. Initially, Snuffy showed up when no one but Big Bird was around, leaving the rest of the neighborhood to think he was imaginary. In the mid-1980s, however, Snuffy was revealed to be &#34;real&#34; and incorporated into the regular cast of the show.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Oscar_the_Grouch" id="w">Oscar the Grouch</a> lives with his pet worm <a href="/wiki/Slimey_the_Worm" id="w">Slimey</a> and his pet elephant <a href="/wiki/List_of_Sesame_Street_characters" id="w">Fluffy</a> in a garbage can in the heap. He is always grumpy, and loves everything that other people hate, and vice versa- he loves rainy days, but hates cute puppies and kittens.  His favourite thing in the world is rubbish (trash, or garbage), hence his signature song, &#34;I Love Trash&#34;, and consequently, he lives in a garbage can.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ernie_and_Bert" id="w">Ernie and Bert</a> two of the most-recognized Muppets, are roommates who share the basement apartment of 123 Sesame Street, and regularly engage in comic routines which showcase their odd-couple personalities. Ernie&#39;s flowerbox was once a hotspot for <a href="/wiki/Twiddlebugs" id="w">Twiddlebugs</a>, a colorful family of insects.  Ernie is a fun-loving orange Muppet who is always ready to play a game, and is always trying, often in vain, to interest Bert in his latest idea for one.  Bert usually ends up grudgingly, or in the case of the &#34;Feelings Game&#34;, unwittingly, joining in.  Ernie especially loves his Rubber Duckie, who is the subject of several of Ernie&#39;s songs. Bert&#39;s idea of having fun involves doing things which most people find boring, like collecting <a href="/wiki/Paperclip" id="w">paperclips</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bottle_cap" id="w">bottle caps</a>.  He especially loves <a href="/wiki/Pigeon" id="w">pigeons</a>, and has invented a dance based on the way they walk, called &#34;Doin&#39; The Pigeon&#34;.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/The_Bear_family" id="w">The Bear family</a>, which is identified as the bears of <i><a href="/wiki/Goldilocks_and_the_Three_Bears" id="w">Goldilocks and the Three Bears</a></i>, resides in <i>Sesame Street</i>. This family, headed by <a href="/wiki/Papa_Bear_(Sesame_Street)" id="w">Papa Bear</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mama_Bear_(Sesame_Street)" id="w">Mama Bear</a>, welcomed their second child <a href="/wiki/Curly_Bear_(Sesame_Street)" id="w">Curly Bear</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Baby_Bear_(Sesame_Street)" id="w">Baby Bear</a> became a good friend of the monsters <a href="/wiki/Telly_Monster" id="w">Telly</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zoe_(Sesame_Street)" id="w">Zoe</a>, Mexico-born <a href="/wiki/Rosita%2C_la_Monstrua_de_las_Cuevas" id="w">Rosita</a>, and the furry, red preschooler <a href="/wiki/Elmo" id="w">Elmo</a>. Elmo has his own segment near the end of each episode, in which viewers explore topics in <i><a href="/wiki/Elmo%26%2339%3Bs_World" id="w">Elmo&#39;s World</a></i>. New to <i>Sesame Street</i> is <a href="/wiki/Abby_Cadabby" id="w">Abby Cadabby</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Fairy" id="w">fairy</a>-in-training who attends Storybook Community School with Baby Bear.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Grover" id="w">Grover</a>&#39;s regular segment, <i><a href="/wiki/Global_Grover" id="w">Global Grover</a></i>, follows the self-described &#34;cute, furry monster&#34; around the world as he explores local cultures and traditions. Grover has had several notable roles over the years, often as a waiter or a superhero (<a href="/wiki/Super_Grover" id="w">Super Grover</a>). In the waiter sketches, Grover always serves the same customer- a blue Muppet with very little hair on his head.  Grover always serves the customer inappropriate food, and he eventually loses his temper. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cookie_Monster" id="w">Cookie Monster</a> fights with his conscience daily during <a href="/wiki/Letter_of_the_Day" id="w">Letter of the Day</a>, as he tries to control his urges to eat the letters, shown as icing on cookies. <a href="/wiki/Prairie_Dawn" id="w">Prairie Dawn</a> often attempts to help Cookie Monster refrain from eating the letters, but never succeeds and always leaves frazzled.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Count_von_Count" id="w">Count von Count</a> has fewer problems during the <a href="/wiki/Number_of_the_Day" id="w">Number of the Day</a> segment, where he indulges in counting until the mystery number is revealed by his pipe organ.  He is usually known simply as &#34;The Count&#34;.  He has more songs than most of the other characters.  They are usually catchy songs, such as &#34;The Batty Bat&#34;, and &#34;The First Day of School&#34;, in which he tells the story of how he soon settled in at school, because he enjoyed counting his fellow pupils.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Humphrey_and_Ingrid" id="w">Humphrey and Ingrid</a> are a married couple who have a baby named <a href="/wiki/Natasha_(Sesame_Street)" id="w">Natasha</a>, and they are the proprietors of the hotel known as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Furry_Arms" id="w">The Furry Arms</a></i>, which is located near the Sesame Street Subway station. </p>
<p>The hotel&#39;s bellhop, <a href="/wiki/Benny_Rabbit" id="w">Benny Rabbit</a>, tends to be easily irritated, but begrudgingly helps out.  His sketch usually includes someone mistakenly referring to him as Bunny, which makes him very angry.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Two-Headed_Monster" id="w">Two-Headed Monster</a> sounded out words coming together, and the <a href="/wiki/Yip-Yips" id="w">Yip-Yip</a> aliens, furry blue monsters with long, curly antennae, named after the only word in their vocabulary, discovered telephones and typewriters. For two seasons, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Sesame_Street_characters#G" id="w">Googel</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Sesame_Street_characters#N" id="w">Narf</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Sesame_Street_characters#M" id="w">Mel</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Sesame_Street_characters#P" id="w">Phoebe</a> hung out in the <i><a href="/wiki/Monster%26%2339%3Bs_Clubhouse" id="w">Monster&#39;s Clubhouse</a></i>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Kermit_the_Frog" id="w">Kermit the Frog</a> hosted the segment <i><a href="/wiki/Sesame_Street_News_Flash" id="w">Sesame Street News Flash</a></i>.  The newsflashes were often takes on popular fairy tales, although there was also one about the first ever day at school, in which Kermit assists the inexperienced caveman teacher, Mr. James, in his lesson about the letter &#34;N&#34;. In other segments, Kermit would play <a href="/wiki/Double_act" id="w">straight man</a> to the wacky antics of other Muppets.</p>
<p>Incidental characters include television personality <a href="/wiki/Guy_Smiley" id="w">Guy Smiley</a>, who presented various game shows, such as &#34;Beat The Time&#34;, and &#34;Mystery Guest&#34;,construction workers <a href="/wiki/Sully_and_Biff" id="w">Sully and Biff</a>, the large <a href="/wiki/Herry_Monster" id="w">Herry Monster</a> (who does not know his own strength), and <a href="/wiki/The_Big_Bad_Wolf" id="w">The Big Bad Wolf</a>, who is not a terror to the Street. <a href="/wiki/Forgetful_Jones" id="w">Forgetful Jones</a>, a cowboy with a short-term memory disorder, rode his trusty Buster the Horse with his girlfriend Clementine, and <a href="/wiki/Rodeo_Rosie" id="w">Rodeo Rosie</a> was an early cowgirl. The <a href="/wiki/Amazing_Mumford" id="w">Amazing Mumford</a> tries his hardest to amaze with his magic, but his tricks always end up backfiring.</p>
<p>Polly Darton was a country singer, a spoof on popular country singer <a href="/wiki/Dolly_Parton" id="w">Dolly Parton</a>, who sang songs like &#34;Counting One to Five&#34;, and &#34;Fourteen Carrot Love&#34;.</p>
<p>&#34;Sherlock Hemlock&#34;, was the self-proclaimed World&#39;s Greatest Detective, although he was actually rather hapless, and it was usually someone else, often his dog Watson, who solved the mystery.  Whenever he discovered a clue, he would say &#34;Egad!&#34;.  He had only one song, &#34;X Marks The Spot&#34;.</p>

<p>A slate of live actors pull the zaniness of the Muppets back to reality. They were not always meant to serve this purpose. The show lost test viewers&#39; attention during the Street Scenes, meaning Muppets needed to be added, to hide the fact it was educational.</p>
<p>Music teacher Bob has been on <i>Sesame Street</i> since its inception. He dated <a href="/wiki/Linda_Bove" id="w">Linda</a> the local <a href="/wiki/New_York_Library" id="w">New York Library</a> librarian, who was the first regular deaf character on television.

<p>General store and restaurant operator <a href="/wiki/Mr._Hooper" id="w">Harold Hooper</a>, played by actor <a href="/wiki/Will_Lee" id="w">Will Lee</a>, was a mainstay at <a href="/wiki/Mr._Hooper%26%2339%3Bs_Store" id="w">Mr. Hooper&#39;s Store</a>. When Lee died in 1982, the producers opted to help their young viewers deal with the death of someone they loved rather than cast a new actor in the role, and the character&#39;s death was discussed in a landmark 1983 episode.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Afterwards, Hooper&#39;s apprentice David took over, followed by later owners Gina, Mr. Handford, and Alan.

Some countries have co-produced their own unique versions of <i>Sesame Street</i>, in which the characters and segments represent their country&#39;s cultures. Other countries simply air a dubbed version of <i>Sesame Street</i>, or a dubbed version of <i><a href="/wiki/Open_Sesame" id="w">Open Sesame</a></i>. Among various other countries, Australia has and still does broadcast the American version on the ABC and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">UK</a> had broadcast the American show, on <a href="/wiki/Channel_4" id="w">Channel 4</a> until 2001 when it was replaced with Henson production <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hoobs" id="w">The Hoobs</a></i>.</p>
<p>Dubbed versions include <i>Seesamtie</i> in Finnish, <i>Boneka Sesame</i> in Indonesian, <i>Sesam Opnist Þú</i> in Icelandic, <i>Sesamo Apriti</i> in Italian, <i>Sezame, otevři se</i> in Czech, and Malay <i>Taman Sesame</i>. In 2004, one Japanese network cancelled the dubbed American <i>Sesame</i>, while another created a local version.

<p><i>Sesame Street</i> has operated with a rigorous research standard since its foundation, to ensure that programming addresses its viewers&#39; needs. The Education and Research (E&#38;R) department of Sesame Workshop, which started with <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Ball_(educator)" id="w">Sam Ball</a>, then employed at Teachers College Columbia University and editor of the Journal of Educational Psychology. E&#38;R is currently headed by <a href="/wiki/Rosemarie_Truglio" id="w">Rosemarie T. Truglio</a>, Ph.D. and <a href="/wiki/Jeanette_Betancourt" id="w">Jeanette Betancourt</a>, Ed. D. Truglio states that the level of interaction between E&#38;R, Content, and Production is &#34;[i]ntimately·hand-in-hand. They are not creating anything without our knowledge, our guidance and our review. We are involved in content development across all media platforms.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Q&A_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Q&A" title="">[18]</a></sup> This close-knit organizational structure has been an integral part of Sesame Workshop since it began.</p>
<p>Writers create plots for <i>Sesame Street</i> scenes and segments, and the content is reviewed by the E&#38;R team, which has authority to reject a script and force rewrites if the content is not acceptable. When a script is factually correct, but includes gray areas that may not be comprehensible to children, the writers and E&#38;R work together to tweak everything. &#34;A balance between content and humor&#34;<sup id="_ref-Q&A_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Q&A" title="">[18]</a></sup> is always pursued, according to Truglio.</p>
<p>Since 1998 Sesame Workshop has provided a great deal of content on its website<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> and others such as <a href="/wiki/Random_House" id="w">Random House</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> The content is targeted at parents and children ranging in age from birth to school-age, and includes information on dozens of topics, such as appropriate parenting techniques, dealing with children&#39;s fears, development of literacy, and maintenance of good health.</p>
<p>Research is funded by government grants, corporate and private donations (including, recently, The Prudential Foundation for the Sesame Beginnings program), and the profits gained from the sale of Sesame Workshop merchandise.</p>
<a id="Healthy_Habits_for_Life" name="Healthy_Habits_for_Life"></a><h2>Healthy Habits for Life</h2>
<p>In 2005, <i>Sesame Street</i> launched its <a href="/wiki/Healthy_Habits_for_Life" id="w">Healthy Habits for Life</a> programming, to encourage young viewers to lead more active and nutritious lifestyles. A major catalyst for this was data published by the US <a href="/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control" id="w">Centers for Disease Control</a> regarding <a href="/wiki/Obesity" id="w">obesity</a> in children.</p>
<p>Health content has existed on <i>Sesame Street</i> for years, but to a limited extent. In one instance press kits for a project were made available, news wires latched onto the story, and literally hundreds of newspapers reported that <a href="/wiki/Cookie_Monster" id="w">Cookie Monster</a> was &#34;going on a diet&#34;. In actuality there was no change to Cookie Monster&#39;s character. The new season featured a new segment with rapper <a href="/wiki/Wyclef_Jean" id="w">Wyclef Jean</a> singing the praises of fruits and vegetables, similar to segments in the 1990s which featured Cookie doing nearly the same.</p>
<p>According to people from Sesame Workshop, {{cquote}}</p>
<p>The Workshop formed an Advisory Board consisting of experts such as <a href="/wiki/Woodie_Kessel" id="w">Woodie Kessel</a>, M.D., M.P.H., the Assistant <a href="/wiki/Surgeon_General_of_the_United_States" id="w">Surgeon General of the United States</a>. This board examines the research of other organizations, and also conducts pilot studies to determine which areas of research should be expanded, based on social, ethnic and socio-economic sections of the population.</p>

<p>Some educators criticized the show when it debuted, as it emphasized <a href="/wiki/Cognitive" id="w">cognitive</a> learning rather than play and activities like other children&#39;s shows at the time.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> In addition it was believed that it would only worsen children&#39;s attention spans. These concerns still exist today, although there is no conclusive proof of this being the case, even after more than 35 seasons of televised shows.</p>
<p>In a letter to the <i>Boston Globe</i>, <a href="/wiki/Boston_University" id="w">Boston University</a> professor of education Frank Garfunkel commented &#34;If what people want is for their children to memorize numbers and letters without regard to their meaning or use—without regard to the differences between children, then <i>Sesame Street</i> is truly responsive. To give a child 30 seconds of one thing and then to switch it and give him 30 seconds of another is to nurture irrelevance.&#34;<sup id="_ref-feinstein_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-feinstein" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the magazine <i><a href="/wiki/Childhood_Education" id="w">Childhood Education</a></i>, Minnie P. Berson of <a href="/wiki/State_University_of_New_York_at_Fredonia" id="w">SUNY Fredonia</a> asked &#34;Why debase the art form of teaching with phony pedagogy, vulgar sideshows, bad acting, and layers of smoke and fog to clog the eager minds of small children?&#34;</p>
<p>For an animation on the letter &#34;J&#34;, the writers included &#34;a day in jail.&#34; This drew criticism from <i><a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle" id="w">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i> columnist <a href="/wiki/Terrence_O%26%2339%3BFlaherty" id="w">Terrence O&#39;Flaherty</a>, despite executive producer David Connell&#39;s assertion that kids are familiar with the word through shows like <i><a href="/wiki/Batman" id="w">Batman</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Superman" id="w">Superman</a></i>, and that &#34;when you&#39;re trying to come up with a lot of words starting with J, you soon run short&#34; of words they are already familiar with.<sup id="_ref-feinstein_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-feinstein" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>The series also met with criticism in its attempts to help the underprivileged. Educator Sister Mary Mel O&#39;Dowd worried that the show might start to replace &#34;personalized experiences&#34;. &#34;If Sesame Street is the only thing ghetto kids have, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to do much good. It never hurts a child to be able to count to 10 or recognize the 26 letters of the alphabet. But without the guidance of a teacher, he&#39;ll be like one of our preschoolers who was able to write &#39;CAUTION&#39; on the blackboard after seeing it on the back of so many buses, and told me &#39;That says STOP.&#39;&#34;<sup id="_ref-feinstein_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-feinstein" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though it is widely beloved, like a number of PBS shows (notably <a href="/wiki/WGBH" id="w">WGBH</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Postcards_From_Buster" id="w">Postcards From Buster</a></i><sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup>) <i>Sesame Street</i> has long had to contend with those who disagree with its social content. <a href="/wiki/Gerald_S._Lesser" id="w">Gerald S.

A 1980 collection of humorous essays by <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Andersen" id="w">Kurt Andersen</a>, titled <i>The Real Thing</i>, made light of the growing rumor. &#34;Bert and Ernie conduct themselves in the same loving, discreet way that millions of gay men, women and hand puppets do. They do their jobs well and live a splendidly settled life together in an impeccably decorated cabinet.&#34;<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> The rumor was promulgated repeatedly, so much so that by 1993, Sesame Workshop had a prepared statement to send out to people inquiring on the topic. In a 1994 effort to get the characters banned, Rev. Joseph Chambers stated on his radio show: &#34;Bert and Ernie are two grown men sharing a house and a bedroom. They share clothes, eat and cook together and have blatantly effeminate characteristics. In one show, Bert teaches Ernie how to sew. In another, they tend plants together. If this isn&#39;t meant to represent a homosexual union, I can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s supposed to represent.&#34;<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> Both Steve Whitmire as Ernie and Eric Jacobson as Bert have stated publicly that the characters are not gay.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> The alleged relationship has been parodied on the adult animated series <i><a href="/wiki/Family_Guy" id="w">Family Guy</a></i> and by <i><a href="/wiki/Ernest_%26amp%3B_Bertram" id="w">Ernest &#38; Bertram</a></i>. The latter, a 2002 short film that ran at the <a href="/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival" id="w">Sundance Film Festival</a>, was the subject of a cease and desist order from the legal department of Sesame Workshop.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> The Broadway musical <i><a href="/wiki/Avenue_Q" id="w">Avenue Q</a></i> includes two characters similar to Bert and Ernie, named Rod and Nicky, one of which is gay.</p>
<p>The pair&#39;s relationship bears similarity to that of <a href="/wiki/Laurel_and_Hardy" id="w">Laurel and Hardy</a>, who were also occasionally shown sleeping together; this became such a comedy staple as to be adopted by <a href="/wiki/Morecambe_and_Wise" id="w">Morecambe and Wise</a> in the 1970s, all of whom were similarly asexual. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Odd_Couple" id="w">The Odd Couple</a></i> is another, more apposite, contemporary comparison. Some adult viewers are upset by the assertions, as in their view, Ernie and Bert act like children, teenagers at the oldest, and are no more different than brothers or cousins who share a room.</p>
<p>In 1990, puppeteer <a href="/wiki/Jim_Henson" id="w">Jim Henson</a>&#39;s death spurred rumors that Ernie would be &#34;killed off&#34; in the show, much the way the character of Mr. Hooper was after actor <a href="/wiki/Will_Lee" id="w">Will Lee</a>&#39;s passing some years earlier.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Rumor said that he would be either killed by a vehicle, <a href="/wiki/AIDS" id="w">AIDS</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Cancer" id="w">cancer</a>. There was no legitimacy to this rumor, but because producers took their time recasting a puppeteer for Ernie, the delay allowed the claims to burgeon. A spokesperson for the series was quoted as saying &#34;Ernie is not dying of AIDS, Ernie is not dying of leukemia. Ernie is a puppet.&#34;<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2002, Sesame Workshop announced that a character with <a href="/wiki/HIV" id="w">HIV</a> would be introduced to <i><a href="/wiki/Takalani_Sesame" id="w">Takalani Sesame</a></i>, the <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South African</a> version of the show. Many conservatives and religious groups wrongly presumed that the American version would be getting a &#34;gay Muppet.&#34;<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> This concern came about presumably because of the <a href="/wiki/HIV_and_AIDS_misconceptions#HIV can infect only homosexual men and drug users" id="w">perceived connection between homosexuality and HIV</a> in the U.S., but the character with HIV is only present on this international version of the show. The character, <a href="/wiki/Kami_(Takalani_Sesame)" id="w">Kami</a>, contracted HIV from a blood transfusion as an infant.</p>

In 2007, a British tabloid suggested Britney Spears was to appear on the series, a claim that was categorically false.</p>
