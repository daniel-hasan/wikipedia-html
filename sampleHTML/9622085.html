<p><b>Tropical Depression One</b> in <a href="/wiki/June_1992" id="w">June 1992</a> produced <a href="/wiki/100-year_flood" id="w">100-year floods</a> in portions of southwestern <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>. The first tropical depression and second <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">tropical cyclone</a> of the <a href="/wiki/1992_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1992 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, the depression developed on <a href="/wiki/June_25" id="w">June 25</a> from a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a>. Located in an environment of strong <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a>, much of the <a href="/wiki/Convection" id="w">convection</a> in the system was located well to the southeast of the poorly defined center of circulation. The depression moved northeastward and struck near <a href="/wiki/Tampa%2C_Florida" id="w">Tampa, Florida</a> on <a href="/wiki/June_26" id="w">June 26</a> shortly before dissipating over land.</p>
<p>The depression, in combination with an upper-level <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">trough</a> to its west, produced heavy rainfall to the east of its path, peaking at 33.43&#160;inches (849&#160;mm) in <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a> and 25&#160;inches (635&#160;mm) in Florida. In Cuba, the rainfall destroyed hundreds of homes and caused two fatalities. In Florida, particularly in <a href="/wiki/Sarasota_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Sarasota</a> and <a href="/wiki/Manatee_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Manatee</a> counties, the rainfall caused severe flooding. 4,000&#160;houses were affected, forcing thousands to evacuate. The flooding killed two in the state and was indirectly responsible for a traffic causality. Damage in Florida totaled over $2.6&#160;million (1992&#160;USD, $3.7&#160;million 2006&#160;USD).</p>

A weak <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> moved off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a> on <a href="/wiki/June_12" id="w">June 12</a>. It tracked westward across the tropical <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> with minimal <a href="/wiki/Convection" id="w">convection</a>, and subsequent to moving through the southern <a href="/wiki/Windward_Islands" id="w">Windward Islands</a> it crossed northern <a href="/wiki/Central_America" id="w">Central America</a>. Convection increased on <a href="/wiki/October_20" id="w">October 20</a> as the wave entered the southwestern <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a>. Under the influence of southeasterly flow from developing <a href="/wiki/1992_Pacific_hurricane_season#Hurricane Celia" id="w">Hurricane Celia</a> in the eastern <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a> and the south-southwesterly flow from a mid- to upper-level <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">trough</a> over the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf of Mexico</a>, the area of disturbed weather tracked generally north-northwestward through the Caribbean Sea while spreading across Cuba and southern Florida. On <a href="/wiki/June_24" id="w">June 24</a>, a mid-level circulation developed near the <a href="/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Channel" id="w">Yucat√°n Channel</a>, and shortly thereafer satellite image loops indicated deep convection with some cyclonic rotation near the western tip of Cuba. A <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Hunters" id="w">reconnaissance aircraft</a> flight was dispatched late on <a href="/wiki/June_24" id="w">June 24</a> into the system to determine if it developed into a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">tropical cyclone</a>, though the flight did not observe evidence of a closed low-level circulation. Subsequent to the flight, satellite imagery indicated a low-level circulation was forming, and on <a href="/wiki/June_25" id="w">June 25</a> ship and buoy data confirmed the system developed into Tropical Depression One while located about 235&#160;miles (375&#160;km) west-southwest of <a href="/wiki/Key_West%2C_Florida" id="w">Key West, Florida</a>.<sup id="_ref-mwr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mwr" title="">[1]</a></sup> Operationally, the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> incorrectly classified the system as Tropical Depression Two due to <a href="/wiki/1992_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Subtropical Storm One" id="w">an earlier subtropical storm</a>.<sup id="_ref-disc1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was poorly organized, with much of the convection located well to the southeast of the broad center due to strong upper-level <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a>. The shearing environment was caused by a trough in the Gulf of Mexico and from the <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#structure" id="w">outflow</a> from Pacific Hurricane Celia.<sup id="_ref-mwr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mwr" title="">[1]</a></sup> This was reflected in forecasts, with the National Hurricane Center predicting no significant change in intensity or structure.<sup id="_ref-disc1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc1" title="">[2]</a></sup> The depression moved northward before turning to the northeast,<sup id="_ref-mwr_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mwr" title="">[1]</a></sup> and on <a href="/wiki/June_26" id="w">June 26</a> the poorly-organized system made <a href="/wiki/Landfall_(meteorology)" id="w">landfall</a> just north of <a href="/wiki/Tampa%2C_Florida" id="w">Tampa, Florida</a>.<sup id="_ref-disc4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc4" title="">[3]</a></sup> The low-level circulation dissipated while crossing the <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida peninsula</a>, with the remnants continuing northeastward before being absorbed by a large <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" id="w">extratropical cyclone</a> over the western Atlantic.<sup id="_ref-mwr_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mwr" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

The tropical depression, in combination with the upper-level trough to its west, produced moderate precipitation across Cuba,<sup id="_ref-mwr_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mwr" title="">[1]</a></sup> peaking at 33.43&#160;inches (849&#160;mm).<sup id="_ref-cubagua_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cubagua" title="">[4]</a></sup>  This is the fifth highest known rainfall total from a tropical cyclone in the country.  The rainfall primarily affected the provinces of <a href="/wiki/Pinar_del_Rio_Province" id="w">Pinar del Rio</a>, <a href="/wiki/Matanzas_Province" id="w">Matanzas</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Havana_Province" id="w">Havana</a>.<sup id="_ref-cubagua_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cubagua" title="">[4]</a></sup> Two Cuban citizens were killed by the rainfall, with an Arab student reported missing and presumed drowned. The deluge damaged or destroyed hundreds of houses in Pinar del Rio and Havana provinces.<sup id="_ref-mh627_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mh627" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In Florida, the depression produced moderate winds near the coast, peaking at 51&#160;mph (82&#160;km/h) in <a href="/wiki/Naples%2C_Florida" id="w">Naples</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[6]</a></sup> As in Cuba, the system dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at 25&#160;inches (635&#160;mm) at <a href="/wiki/Arcadia_Tower%2C_Florida" id="w">Arcadia Tower</a>. Large portions of the state reported totals in excess of 10&#160;inches (255&#160;mm) from the depression, with much of <a href="/wiki/Sarasota_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Sarasota County</a> receiving over 20&#160;inches (510&#160;mm) of rain.<sup id="_ref-rain_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rain" title="">[7]</a></sup> The rainfall was classified as a <a href="/wiki/100-year_flood" id="w">100-year flood</a> in Sarasota and <a href="/wiki/Manatee_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Manatee</a> counties, where flooding reached 6 feet deep in some locations.<sup id="_ref-spt627_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt627" title="">[8]</a></sup> Officials in Manatee County declared a state of emergency in response to the flooding.<sup id="_ref-spt626_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt626" title="">[9]</a></sup> There, about 3,000&#160;people were forced to evacuate their homes due to the flooding, some of whom left by boat. The flooding damaged about 50&#160;houses in and around <a href="/wiki/Oneco%2C_Florida" id="w">Oneco</a>. Due to the evacuations, no injuries were reported.<sup id="_ref-spt627_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt627" title="">[8]</a></sup> The reservoir in Manatee County rose to over 39&#160;feet (11.9&#160;m), 4&#160;feet (1.2&#160;m) above normal, which resulted in officials opening floodgates to prevent flooding. In Sarasota County, the flooding closed several roads and led to many overflown creeks and rivers,<sup id="_ref-spt626_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt626" title="">[9]</a></sup> including the <a href="/wiki/Horse_Creek_(Florida)" id="w">Horse Creek</a> which crested at 5.8&#160;feet (1.8&#160;m) above flood level. Damage to roads and bridges totaled about $1&#160;million (1992&#160;USD, $1.5&#160;million 2006&#160;USD).<sup id="_ref-spt628_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt628" title="">[10]</a></sup> Due to the flat landscape of the region, the flooding persisted for several days. The depression spawned a tornado in a <a href="/wiki/Mobile_home" id="w">mobile home</a> park in <a href="/wiki/Nokomis%2C_Florida" id="w">Nokomis</a>, destroying the roofs of 5&#160;homes and causing leaks in 12&#160;others. Throughout the area, the passage of the depression left about 45,000&#160;customers without power, primarily due to gusty winds. The outages were fairly short-lived due to power companies calling in extra workers to restore the power. Moderate winds toppled a construction crane at the northern end of the <a href="/wiki/Sunshine_Skyway_Bridge" id="w">Sunshine Skyway Bridge</a>, closing the bridge for 35&#160;minutes before the crane was removed.<sup id="_ref-spt626_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt626" title="">[9]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/Pinellas_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Pinellas County</a>, a man hydroplaned while driving along a flooded roadway; he crashed into a concrete pole and was killed.<sup id="_ref-spt628_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt628" title="">[10]</a></sup> Severe crop damage to orange trees was reported in association with the flooding.<sup id="_ref-spt630_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt630" title="">[11]</a></sup> Damage from the depression totaled over $2.6&#160;million (1992&#160;USD, $3.7&#160;million 2006&#160;USD),<sup id="_ref-char_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-char" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-spt626_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt626" title="">[9]</a></sup> with about&#160;4,000 houses affected by the flooding<sup id="_ref-spt626_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt626" title="">[9]</a></sup> and an additional 70&#160;destroyed. 2&#160;people were killed in Florida.<sup id="_ref-annamaria_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-annamaria" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_14" id="w">August 14</a>, about 6&#160;weeks after the flooding, <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President</a> <a href="/wiki/George_H._W._Bush" id="w">George H. W. Bush</a> declared a major disaster area for <a href="/wiki/Charlotte_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Charlotte</a>, <a href="/wiki/DeSoto_County%2C_Florida" id="w">DeSoto</a>, Manatee and Sarasota counties.
