<p><b><i>Jr. Pac-Man</i></b> is an <a href="/wiki/Arcade_game" id="w">arcade game</a> released in <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a> by <a href="/wiki/Midway_Games" id="w">Bally Midway</a>.  It is based on <i><a href="/wiki/Pac-Man" id="w">Pac-Man</a></i> and its derivatives, but is not officially part of the <i>Pac-Man</i> series &#8212; along with <i><a href="/wiki/Baby_Pac-Man" id="w">Baby Pac-Man</a></i>, this game was created without the authorization of <a href="/wiki/Namco" id="w">Namco</a>.  This was one of the games that eventually led to the termination of the <a href="/wiki/License" id="w">licensing agreement</a> between Namco and Midway.{{Fact}}</p>
<a id="Gameplay" name="Gameplay"></a><h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The gameplay of <i>Jr. Pac-Man</i> is largely identical to that of its predecessors, with a few differences.  The maze is now two times the width of the display, and a virtual camera pans left and right along the maze to follow Jr. Pac-Man, sometimes resulting in the ghosts being off-screen.  A total of seven mazes appear throughout the game, and unlike previous <i>Pac-Man</i> games, none of the mazes have tunnels that wrap from one side of the screen to the other.</p>
<p>As in prior games, bonus prizes appear in each level.  (These prizes were called fruits in <i>Pac-Man</i>, but none of the prizes in this game are fruits.)  Similar to <i>Ms. Pac-Man</i>, prizes appear in the middle of the maze and bounce around for a time, but as a prize encounters dots, it changes them into larger dots that slow Jr. Pac-Man down but are worth more points.  If not eaten beforehand, a prize self-destructs with an energizer (also known as a &#34;power pellet&#34;), taking the energizer with it.</p>
<p>There are also a few cosmetic differences: The main character is Jr. Pac-Man (who wears a <a href="/wiki/Beanie" id="w">propeller beanie</a>); Clyde, the orange ghost, is now called Tim; and the game&#39;s graphics and sound have been updated, including a lower-case <a href="/wiki/Anti-aliased" id="w">anti-aliased</a> <a href="/wiki/Font" id="w">font</a> for scores and game text.  The game&#39;s intermissions center around the developing relationship between Jr. Pac-Man and Yum-Yum (apparently the daughter of Blinky).</p>

<p>Between the effects of the <a href="/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983" id="w">video game crash of 1983</a> and the unauthorized status of this game, the only sanctioned port of this game was released for the <a href="/wiki/Atari_2600" id="w">Atari 2600</a> in <a href="/wiki/1987" id="w">1987</a> with a 1984 copyright date.  It is generally considered a faithful port of the arcade game, especially given the console&#39;s limitations.  A version for the <a href="/wiki/Atari_5200" id="w">Atari 5200</a> was nearly completed, but was never officially released.  A <a href="/wiki/Read-only_memory" id="w">ROM</a> image for this game can be played with an <a href="/wiki/Emulator" id="w">emulator</a>.</p>
<p>A similar game called <i><a href="/wiki/Pac-Man_2:_The_New_Adventures#Side quests" id="w">Pac-Jr.</a></i> was released as a minigame in the <a href="/wiki/Sega_Mega_Drive" id="w">Sega Mega Drive/Genesis</a> version of <i><a href="/wiki/Pac-Man_2:_The_New_Adventures" id="w">Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a>.  This version is an official release by <a href="/wiki/Namco" id="w">Namco</a> and bears only a passing resemblance to <i>Jr. Pac-Man</i>, playing much more like <i><a href="/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man" id="w">Ms. Pac-Man</a></i> instead.</p>
