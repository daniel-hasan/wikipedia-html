<p><b><a href="/wiki/Slavery" id="w">Slavery</a></b> was an essential component of the development of <b><a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" id="w">Ancient Greece</a></b> throughout its history. 
Most ancient writers considered slavery not only necessary but natural; neither the <a href="/wiki/Stoicism" id="w">Stoics</a> nor the <a href="/wiki/Early_Christianity" id="w">Early Christians</a> questioned the practice. However, some isolated debate began to appear, notably in <a href="/wiki/Socrates" id="w">Socratic dialogues</a>, as early as the <a href="/wiki/4th_century_BC" id="w">4th century BC</a>.</p>
<p>In conformity with modern historiographical practice, this article will discuss only <a href="/wiki/Chattel_slavery" id="w">chattel slavery</a>, as opposed to dependent groups such as the <a href="/wiki/Penestae" id="w">Penestae</a> of <a href="/wiki/Thessaly" id="w">Thessaly</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Sparta" id="w">Spartan</a> <a href="/wiki/Helots" id="w">Helots</a> or even the <a href="/wiki/Klarotes" id="w">Klarotes</a> of <a href="/wiki/Crete" id="w">Crete</a>, who were more like medieval <a href="/wiki/Serfdom" id="w">serfs</a>. The chattel slave is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner who may buy, sell, or lease him or her as one might any <a href="/wiki/Chattel" id="w">chattel</a> good.</p> 
<p>The study of slavery in Ancient Greece poses a number of significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing on the city of <a href="/wiki/Athens" id="w">Athens</a>. No treatise is specifically devoted to the subject. Judicial pleadings of the <a href="/wiki/4th_century_BC" id="w">4th century BC</a> were interested in slavery only as a source of revenue. <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek_comedy" id="w">Comedy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Greek_tragedy" id="w">tragedy</a> represented stereotypes. Iconography made no substantial differentiation between slave and <a href="/wiki/Artisan" id="w">craftsman</a>. Even the terminology is often vague. </p>
<a id="Terminology" name="Terminology"></a><h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>The Ancient Greeks had many words to describe slaves, though many need to be placed in proper context to avoid ambiguity. In <a href="/wiki/Homer" id="w">Homer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hesiod" id="w">Hesiod</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theognis_of_Megara" id="w">Theognis of Megara</a>, the slave was called {{polytonic}} / <i>dmôs</i>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The term has a general meaning but refers particularly to war prisoners taken as booty,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> in other words, property. During the classical period, the Greeks frequently used {{polytonic}} / <i>andrápodon</i>,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> literally, &#34;one with the feet of a man&#34;, as opposed to {{polytonic}} / <i>tetrapodon</i>, &#34;quadruped&#34;, or livestock.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The most common word is undoubtedly {{polytonic}} / <i>doûlos</i>,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> an earlier form of which appears in <a href="/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece" id="w">Mycenaean</a> inscriptions as <i>do-e-ro</i>,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> used in opposition to &#34;free man&#34; ({{polytonic}} / <i>eleútheros</i>). The <a href="/wiki/Verb" id="w">verb</a> {{polytonic}} can be used metaphorically for other forms of dominion, as of one city over another or parents over their children.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Finally, the term {{polytonic}} / <i>oikétês</i> was used, meaning literally &#34;one who lives in the house&#34;, referring to household servants.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p> 
<p>Other terms used were less precise and required context:

The presence of slaves is confirmed in the <a href="/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece" id="w">Mycenaean civilization</a>. In the tablets from <a href="/wiki/Pylos" id="w">Pylos</a> 140 <i>do-e-ro</i> can be identified with certainty. Two legal categories can be distinguished: &#34;common&#34; slaves and &#34;slaves of the god&#34; (<i>te-o-jo do-e-ro</i> / θεοιο), the god in this case probably being <a href="/wiki/Poseidon" id="w">Poseidon</a>. Slaves of the god are always mentioned by name and own their own land; their legal status is close to that of freemen. The nature and origin of their bond to the divinity is unclear.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> As for common slaves, their names show that some of them came from <a href="/wiki/Kythira" id="w">Kythera</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chios" id="w">Chios</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lemnos" id="w">Lemnos</a>, or even <a href="/wiki/Halicarnassus" id="w">Halicarnassus</a> and were probably enslaved as a result of <a href="/wiki/Piracy" id="w">piracy</a>. The tablets indicate that unions between slaves and non-slaves were not uncommon and that slaves could be independent artisans and could retain plots of land. In fact, it appears that the major division in Mycenaean civilization was not between slave and free, but between those attached to the palace and those not.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p> 
<p>There is no continuity between the Mycenaean era and the time of <a href="/wiki/Homer" id="w">Homer</a>, where social structures reflected those of the <a href="/wiki/Greek_dark_ages" id="w">Greek dark ages</a>. The terminology differs: the slave is no longer <i>do-e-ro</i> (doulos) but <i>dmôs</i>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> In the <a href="/wiki/Iliad" id="w">Iliad</a>, slaves are mainly women taken as booty of war,<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> while men were either ransomed<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> or killed on the battlefield. In the <i>Odyssey</i>, the slaves also seem to be mostly women.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> These slaves were servants<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> sometimes concubines.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> There were some male slaves, especially in the <i>Odyssey</i>, a prime example being the swineherd Eumaeus. The slave was distinctive in being a member of the core part of the <i>oikos</i> (&#34;family unit&#34;, &#34;household&#34;): <a href="/wiki/Laertes" id="w">Laertes</a> eats and drinks with his servants<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup>; in the winter, he sleeps in their company.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> The term <i>dmôs</i> is not considered pejorative, and Eumaeus, the &#34;divine&#34; swineherd,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> benefits from the same <a href="/wiki/Epithets_in_Homer" id="w">Homeric epithet</a> as the Greek heroes. In spite of this, slavery remained a disgrace. Eumaeus himself declares that “Zeus, of the far-borne voice, takes away the half of a man&#39;s virtue, when the day of slavery comes upon him.”<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>It is difficult to determine when slave trading began in the archaic period. In <i>Works and Days</i> (<a href="/wiki/8th_century_BC" id="w">8th century BC</a>), <a href="/wiki/Hesiod" id="w">Hesiod</a> owns numerous <i>dmôes</i>,<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> although their status is unclear. The presence of <i>douloi</i> is confirmed by lyric poets such as <a href="/wiki/Archilochus" id="w">Archilochus</a> or <a href="/wiki/Theognis_of_Megara" id="w">Theognis of Megara</a>.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> According to epigraphic evidence, the homicide law of <a href="/wiki/Draco_(lawgiver)" id="w">Draco</a> (c. 620 BC) mentioned slaves.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> According to Plutarch,<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Solon" id="w">Solon</a> (c. 594-593 BC) forbade slaves from practising gymnastics and pederasty. By the end of the period, references become more common. Slavery becomes prevalent at the very moment when Solon establishes the basis for Athenian democracy. Classical scholar <a href="/wiki/Moses_Finley" id="w">Moses Finley</a> likewise remarks that Chios, which, according to <a href="/wiki/Theopompus" id="w">Theopompus</a>,<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> was the first city to organize a slave trade, also enjoyed an early democratic process (in the 6th century BC).

Strictly speaking, there was no such thing as a servile act. All activities were open to slaves with the exception of politics, the only activity over which citizens had a monopoly.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Moreover, for the Greeks, politics was the only activity worthy of a citizen, the rest having been relegated wherever possible to non-citizens.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> It was status that was of importance, not activity.</p> 
<p>The principal use of slaves was in <a href="/wiki/Agriculture_of_ancient_Greece" id="w">agriculture</a>, the foundation of the Greek economy. Some small landowners might own one slave, or even two.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> An abundant literature of manuals for landowners (such as the <a href="/wiki/Oeconomicus" id="w">&#39;&#39;Economy&#39;&#39;</a> of <a href="/wiki/Xenophon" id="w">Xenophon</a> or that of <a href="/wiki/Pseudo-Aristotle" id="w">Pseudo-Aristotle</a>) confirms the presence of dozens of slaves on the larger estates; they could be common labourers or foremen. The extent to which slaves were used as a labour force in farming is still disputed.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> It is, however, certain on the one hand that rural slavery was very common in Athens, and, on the other, that Ancient Greece did not know the immense slave populations found on the Roman <i><a href="/wiki/Latifundia" id="w">latifundia</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Mining" id="w">mines</a> and <a href="/wiki/Quarry" id="w">quarries</a>, slave labour was by far most prevalent. Here were found large slave populations, often leased out by rich private citizens. The <a href="/wiki/Strategos" id="w">strategos</a> <a href="/wiki/Nicias" id="w">Nicias</a> leased a thousand slaves to the silver mines of <a href="/wiki/Laurium" id="w">Laurium</a> in <a href="/wiki/Attica" id="w">Attica</a>; Hipponicos, 600; and Philomidès, 300. Xenophon<sup id="_ref-XREV_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-XREV" title="">[39]</a></sup> indicates that they received one <a href="/wiki/Obolus" id="w">obolus</a> per slave per day, amounting to 60 <a href="/wiki/Drachma" id="w">drachmas</a> per year. This was one of the most prized investments for Athenians. The number of slaves working in the Laurium mines or in the mills processing ore can be estimated at 30,000.<sup id="_ref-L916_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-L916" title="">[40]</a></sup> Xenophon even suggested that the city buy a large number of slaves, up to three state slaves per citizen, so that their leasing would assure the upkeep of all the citizens.<sup id="_ref-XREV_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-XREV" title="">[39]</a></sup></p> 
<p>Slaves were also used as craftsmen and <a href="/wiki/Tradesperson" id="w">tradespersons</a>. As in agriculture, they were used for labour which was beyond the capability of the family. However, the slave population was greatest in the workshops. The shield factory of <a href="/wiki/Lysias" id="w">Lysias</a> employed 120 slaves,<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> and the father of <a href="/wiki/Demosthenes" id="w">Demosthenes</a> owned 32 cutlers and 20 bedmakers.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>Slaves were also employed in the home. The domestic&#39;s main role was to stand in for his master at his trade and to accompany him on trips. In time of war he was batman to the <a href="/wiki/Hoplite" id="w">hoplite</a>; it has been argued that their actual role was far greater.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> The female slave carried out domestic tasks, in particular bread baking and textile making. Only the poorest citizens did not possess a domestic slave.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

It is difficult to estimate the number of slaves in ancient Greece, given the lack of a precise census and variations in definitions during that era. It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population with as many as 80,000 in the <a href="/wiki/5th_century_BC" id="w">5th</a> and <a href="/wiki/6th_century_BC" id="w">6th</a> centuries BC,<sup id="_ref-L916_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-L916" title="">[40]</a></sup> on average three or four slaves per household. In the <a href="/wiki/5th_century_BC" id="w">5th century BC</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thucydides" id="w">Thucydides</a> remarked upon the desertion of 20,000 slaves during the <a href="/wiki/Decelea" id="w">war of Decelea</a>, mostly tradesmen. The lowest estimate, of 20,000 slaves, during the time of <a href="/wiki/Demosthenes" id="w">Demosthenes</a>,<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> corresponds to one slave per family. Between 317 BC and 307 BC, the tyrant <a href="/wiki/Demetrius_Phalereus" id="w">Demetrius Phalereus</a> ordered<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> a general census of Attica which arrived at the following figures: 21,000 citizens, 10,000 <a href="/wiki/Metic" id="w">Metics</a> and 400,000 slaves. The orator <a href="/wiki/Hypereides" id="w">Hypereides</a>, in his <i>Against Areistogiton</i>, recalls that the effort to enlist 150,000 male slaves of military age led to the defeat of the Greeks at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Chaeronea_(338_BC)" id="w">Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)</a>, which corresponds to the figures of <a href="/wiki/Ctesicles" id="w">Ctesicles</a>.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the literature, it appears that the majority of Athenians owned at least one slave. <a href="/wiki/Aristophanes" id="w">Aristophanes</a>, in <i><a href="/wiki/Plutus_(play)" id="w">Plutus</a></i>, portrays poor peasants who have several slaves; Aristotle defines a house as containing freemen and slaves.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> Conversely, not owning even one slave was a clear sign of poverty. In the celebrated discourse of <a href="/wiki/Lysias" id="w">Lysias</a> <i>For the Invalid</i>, a cripple pleading for a pension explains &#34;my income is very small and now I&#39;m required to do these things myself and do not even have the means to purchase a slave who can do these things for me.&#34;<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> However, the huge slave populations of the Romans were unknown in Ancient Greece. When Athenaeus<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> cites the case of Mnason, friend of Aristotle and owner of a thousand slaves, this appears to be exceptional. <a href="/wiki/Plato" id="w">Plato</a>, owner of five slaves at the time of his death, describes the very rich as owning 50 slaves.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p> 
<p>In terms of density, Thucydides estimates that the isle of <a href="/wiki/Chios" id="w">Chios</a> had proportionally the largest number of slaves.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Sources_of_supply" name="Sources_of_supply"></a><h3>Sources of supply</h3>

<a id="War" name="War"></a><h4>War</h4>

Thus, nobody was immune from falling into servitude. In certain areas, piracy was practically a national specialty, described by Thucydides as &#34;the old-fashioned&#34; way of life.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> Such was the case in <a href="/wiki/Acarnania" id="w">Acarnania</a>, <a href="/wiki/Crete" id="w">Crete</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Aetolia" id="w">Aetolia</a>.

<a id="International_trade" name="International_trade"></a><h4>International trade</h4>
<p>There was in addition a slave trade with neighbouring barbarians. The fragmentary list of slaves confiscated from the property of the mutilators of the <i><a href="/wiki/Herma" id="w">Hermai</a></i> mentions 32 slaves whose nationalities have been ascertained: 13 came from <a href="/wiki/Thrace" id="w">Thrace</a>, 7 from <a href="/wiki/Caria" id="w">Caria</a>, and the others came from <a href="/wiki/Cappadocia" id="w">Cappadocia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Caria" id="w">Caria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scythia" id="w">Scythia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phrygia" id="w">Phrygia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lydia" id="w">Lydia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Syria" id="w">Syria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ilyria" id="w">Ilyria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Macedon" id="w">Macedon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peloponnese" id="w">Peloponnese</a>.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> The mechanism was similar to that later seen in the <a href="/wiki/African_slave_trade" id="w">African slave trade</a>: local professionals sold their fellow creatures to Greek slave merchants. The principal centres of the slave trade appear to have been <a href="/wiki/Ephesus" id="w">Ephesus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Byzantium" id="w">Byzantium</a>, and even faraway <a href="/wiki/Tanais" id="w">Tanais</a> at the mouth of the <a href="/wiki/Don_River%2C_Russia" id="w">Don</a>. Some barbarian slaves were victims of war or localised piracy, but others were sold by their parents.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> There is a lack of direct evidence of slave traffic, but corroborating evidence exists. Firstly, certain nationalities are consistently and significantly represented in the slave population, such as the corps of Scythian archers employed by Athens as a police force—originally 300, but eventually nearly a thousand.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> Secondly, the names given to slaves in the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek_comedy" id="w">comedies</a> often had a geographical link; thus <i>Thratta</i>, used by <a href="/wiki/Aristophanes" id="w">Aristophanes</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wasps" id="w">The Wasps</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Acharnians" id="w">The Acharnians</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Peace_(play)" id="w">Peace</a></i>, simply signified <i>Thracian woman</i>.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> Finally, the nationality of a slave was a significant criterion for major purchasers; the ancient advice was not to concentrate too many slaves of the same origin in the same place, in order to limit the risk of revolt.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> It is also probable that, as with the Romans, certain nationalities were considered more productive as slaves than others.</p> 
<p>The price of slaves varied in accordance with their ability. Xenophon valued a Laurion miner at 180 <a href="/wiki/Drachma" id="w">drachmas</a>;<sup id="_ref-XREV_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-XREV" title="">[39]</a></sup> in comparison a workman at major works was paid one <a href="/wiki/Drachma" id="w">drachma</a> per day.

A tax on sale revenues was levied by the market cities. A large slave market was organized, for instance, during the festivities at the temple of <a href="/wiki/Apollo" id="w">Apollo</a> at <a href="/wiki/Actium" id="w">Actium</a>. The Acarnanian League, who was in charge of the logistics, received half of the tax proceeds, the other half going to the city of Anactorion, of which Actium was a part.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> Buyers enjoyed a guarantee against <a href="/wiki/Latent_defect" id="w">latent defects</a>; the transaction could be invalidated if the bought slave turned out to be crippled and the buyer had not been warned about it.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup></p>

Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not &#34;breed&#34; their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of houseborn slaves appears to have been rather large in <a href="/wiki/Ptolemaic_Egypt" id="w">Ptolemaic Egypt</a> and in manumission inscriptions at Delphi.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain.

<p>Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that &#34;…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.&#34;<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> More simply, the explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was somewhat cheap,<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup> so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother&#39;s life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.<sup id="_ref-G58_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-G58" title="">[80]</a></sup></p> 
<p>Houseborn slaves (<i>oikogeneis</i>) often constituted a privileged class.

<a id="Status_of_slaves" name="Status_of_slaves"></a><h2>Status of slaves</h2>
<p>The Greeks had not one but many degrees of enslavement.

Athenian slaves were the property of their master (or of the state), who could dispose of them as he saw fit. He could give, sell, rent, or bequeath them. A slave could have a spouse and children, but the slave family was not recognized by the state, and the master could scatter the family members at any time.<sup id="_ref-G47_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-G47" title="">[84]</a></sup> Slaves had few or no judicial rights and were represented by their master in all judicial proceedings.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup> A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free man would result in a flogging for the slave; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma.<sup id="_ref-C203_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-C203" title="">[81]</a></sup>  With several minor exceptions, the testimony of a slave was not admissible except under torture. <sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> Slaves were tortured in trials because they often remained trusty to their master. A famous example of trusty slave was <a href="/wiki/Themistocles" id="w">Themistocles</a>&#39;s Persian slave <a href="/wiki/Sicinnus" id="w">Sicinnus</a> (the counterpart of <a href="/wiki/Ephialtes_of_Trachis" id="w">Ephialtes of Trachis</a>), who, despite his Persian origin, betrayed <a href="/wiki/Xerxes" id="w">Xerxes</a> and helped Athenians in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis" id="w">Battle of Salamis</a>.  Despite the inevitable torture in trials, however, the Athenian slave was protected in an indirect way: if he was mistreated, the master could initiate litigation for damages and interest ({{polytonic}} / <i>dikê blabês</i>).<sup id="_ref-C203_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-C203" title="">[81]</a></sup> Conversely, a master who excessively mistreated a slave could be prosecuted by any citizen ({{polytonic}} / <i>graphê hybreôs</i>); this was not enacted for the sake of the slave, but to avoid violent excess ({{polytonic}} / <i><a href="/wiki/Hubris" id="w">hubris</a></i>).<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup></p>
<p>As for the murder of a slave, <a href="/wiki/Isocrates" id="w">Isocrates</a> claims that “not even the most worthless slave can be put to death without trial”;<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup> the master&#39;s power over his slave was not absolute, as it was under Roman law.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Draco_(lawgiver)" id="w">Draco</a>&#39;s law apparently punished with death the murder of a slave; the underlying principle was: “was the crime such that, if it became more widespread, it would do serious harm to society?”<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup> The suit that could be brought against a slave&#39;s killer was not a suit for damages, as would be the case for the killing of cattle, but a {{polytonic}} (<i>dikê phonikê</i>), demanding punishment for the religious pollution brought by the shedding of blood.<sup id="_ref-M213_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-M213" title="">[91]</a></sup> In the 4th century BC, the suspect was judged by the <a href="/wiki/Palladion" id="w">Palladion</a>, a court which had jurisdiction over <a href="/wiki/Unintentional_homicide" id="w">unintentional homicide</a>;<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup> the imposed penalty seems to have been more than a fine but less than death—maybe exile, as was the case in the murder of a Metic.<sup id="_ref-M213_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-M213" title="">[91]</a></sup></p>

In <a href="/wiki/Gortyn" id="w">Gortyn</a>, in Crete, according to a <a href="/wiki/Gortyn_code" id="w">code</a> engraved in stone dating to the <a href="/wiki/6th_century_BC" id="w">6th century BC</a>, slaves (<i>doulos</i> or <i>oikeus</i>) found themselves in a state of great dependence.

As an example, the rape of a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 <a href="/wiki/Stater" id="w">staters</a>, while the rape of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus.<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup> </p>

<p>Prior to its interdiction by <a href="/wiki/Solon" id="w">Solon</a>, Athenians practised debt enslavement: a citizen incapable of paying his debts became &#34;enslaved&#34; to the creditor.<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup> The exact nature of this depency is a much controverted issue amongst modern historians: was it truly slavery or another form of bondage? However, this issue primarily concerned those peasants known as &#34;hektēmoroi&#34;<sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[103]</a></sup> working leased land belonging to rich landowners and unable to pay their rents.

<p>Though much of Solon&#39;s vocabulary is that of &#34;traditional&#34; slavery, servitude for debt was at least different in that the enslaved Athenian remained an Athenian, dependent on another Athenian, in his place of birth.<sup id="_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#_note-106" title="">[106]</a></sup> It is this aspect which explains the great wave of discontent with slavery of the <a href="/wiki/6th_century_BC" id="w">6th century BC</a>, which was not intended to free all slaves but only those enslaved by debt.<sup id="_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#_note-107" title="">[107]</a></sup> The reforms of Solon did, however, leave two exceptions: the guardian of an unmarried woman who had lost her virginity had the right to sell her as a slave,<sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[108]</a></sup> and a citizen could “expose” (i.e., abandon) unwanted newborn children.<sup id="_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#_note-109" title="">[109]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Manumission" name="Manumission"></a><h3>Manumission</h3>
<p>The practice of <a href="/wiki/Manumission" id="w">manumission</a> is confirmed to have existed in <a href="/wiki/Chios" id="w">Chios</a> from the <a href="/wiki/6th_century_BC" id="w">6th century BC</a>.<sup id="_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#_note-110" title="">[110]</a></sup> It probably dates back to an earlier period, as it was an oral procedure. Informal emancipations are also confirmed in the classical period. It was sufficient to have witnesses, who would escort the citizen to a public emancipation of his slave, either at the <a href="/wiki/Theatre_of_Ancient_Greece#Theatre Structure and Layout" id="w">theatre</a> or before a public tribunal.<sup id="_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#_note-111" title="">[111]</a></sup> This practice was outlawed in Athens in the middle of the <a href="/wiki/6th_century_BC" id="w">6th century BC</a> in order to avoid public disorder.</p>
<p>The practice became more common in the <a href="/wiki/4th_century_BC" id="w">4th century BC</a> and gave rise to inscriptions in stone which have been recovered from shrines such as <a href="/wiki/Delphi" id="w">Delphi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dodona" id="w">Dodona</a>. They primarily date to the <a href="/wiki/2nd_century_BC" id="w">2nd</a> and <a href="/wiki/1st_century_BC" id="w">1st</a> centuries BC, and the <a href="/wiki/1st_century" id="w">1st century</a> AD. Collective manumission was possible; an example is known from the <a href="/wiki/2nd_century_BC" id="w">2nd century BC</a> in the island of <a href="/wiki/Thasos" id="w">Thasos</a>. It probably took place during a period of war as a reward for the slaves&#39; loyalty,<sup id="_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#_note-112" title="">[112]</a></sup> but in most cases the documentation deals with a voluntary act on the part of the master (predominantly male, but in the Hellenistic period also female). The slave was often required to pay for himself an amount at least equivalent to his street value. To do this he could use his savings or take a loan ({{polytonic}} / <i>eranos</i>) from his master, a friend, or a client, which last was often the case for a courtesan, one of the most famous examples of which involved the <a href="/wiki/Hetaera" id="w">hetaera</a> Neaira.<sup id="_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#_note-113" title="">[113]</a></sup> The emancipation was often of a religious nature, where the slave was considered to be &#34;sold&#34; to a deity, often Delphian <a href="/wiki/Apollo" id="w">Apollo</a>,<sup id="_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#_note-114" title="">[114]</a></sup> or was consecrated after his emancipation. The temple would receive a portion of the monetary transaction and would guarantee the contract. The manumission could also be entirely civil, in which case the magistrate played the role of the deity.<sup id="_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#_note-115" title="">[115]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The slave&#39;s freedom could be either total or partial, at the master&#39;s whim. In the former, the emancipated slave was legally protected against all attempts at re-enslavement—for instance, on the part of the former master&#39;s inheritors.<sup id="_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#_note-116" title="">[116]</a></sup> In the latter case, the emancipated slave could be liable to a number of obligations to the former master. The most restrictive contract was the <i>paramone</i>, a type of enslavement of limited duration during which time the master retained practically absolute rights.<sup id="_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#_note-117" title="">[117]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>In regard to the city, the emancipated slave was far from equal to a citizen by birth. He was liable to all types of obligations, as one can see from the proposals of <a href="/wiki/Plato" id="w">Plato</a> in <i>The Laws</i>:<sup id="_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#_note-118" title="">[118]</a></sup> presentation three times monthly at the home of the former master, forbidden to become richer than him, etc. In fact, the status of emancipated slaves was similar to that of <a href="/wiki/Metic" id="w">Metics</a>, the residing foreigners, who were free but did not enjoy a citizen&#39;s rights.<sup id="_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#_note-119" title="">[119]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Spartan_slaves%3F" name="Spartan_slaves%3F"></a><h3>Spartan slaves?</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sparta" id="w">Spartan</a> citizens used <a href="/wiki/Helot" id="w">Helots</a>, a dependent group collectively owned by the state. It is uncertain whether they had chattel slaves as well. There are mentions of people manumitted by Spartans, which is supposedly forbidden for Helots, or sold outside of <a href="/wiki/Lakonia" id="w">Lakonia</a>: the poet <a href="/wiki/Alcman" id="w">Alcman</a>;<sup id="_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#_note-120" title="">[120]</a></sup> a Philoxenos from <a href="/wiki/Cytherea" id="w">Cytherea</a>, reputedly enslaved with all his fellow citizens when his city was conquered, later sold to an Athenian;<sup id="_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#_note-121" title="">[121]</a></sup> a Spartan cook bought by <a href="/wiki/Dionysius_the_Elder" id="w">Dionysius the Elder</a> or by a king of <a href="/wiki/Pontus" id="w">Pontus</a>, both versions being mentioned by Plutarch;<sup id="_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#_note-122" title="">[122]</a></sup> and the famous Spartan nurses, much appreciated by Athenian parents.<sup id="_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#_note-123" title="">[123]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some texts mention both slaves and Helots, which seems to indicate that they were not the same thing. <a href="/wiki/Pseudo-Plato" id="w">Pseudo-Plato</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Alcibiades_I" id="w">Alcibiades I</a></i> cites &#34;the ownership of slaves, and notably Helots&#34; amongst the Spartan riches,<sup id="_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#_note-124" title="">[124]</a></sup> and Plutarch writes about &#34;slaves and Helots&#34;.<sup id="_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#_note-125" title="">[125]</a></sup> Finally, according to Thucydides, the agreement which ended the 464 BC revolt of Helots stated that any Messenian rebel who might hereafter be found within the <a href="/wiki/Peloponnese" id="w">Peloponnese</a> was &#34;to be the slave of his captor&#34;, which means that the ownership of chattel slaves was not illegal at that time.</p>
<p>Most historians thus concur that chattel slaves were indeed used in Sparta, at least after the Lacedemonian victory of 404 BC against Athens, but not in great numbers and only amongst the upper classes.<sup id="_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#_note-126" title="">[126]</a></sup> As was the case in the other Greek cities, chattel slaves could be purchased at the market or taken in war.</p>

It is difficult to appreciate the condition of Greek slaves. According to pseudo-Aristotle, the daily routine of slaves could be summed up in three words: &#34;work, discipline, and feeding&#34;.<sup id="_ref-127" class="reference"><a href="#_note-127" title="">[127]</a></sup> Xenophon&#39;s advice is to treat slaves as domestic animals, that is to say punish disobedience and reward good behaviour.<sup id="_ref-128" class="reference"><a href="#_note-128" title="">[128]</a></sup> For his part, Aristotle prefers to see slaves treated as children and to use not only orders but also recommendations, as the slave is capable of understanding reasons when they are explained.<sup id="_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#_note-129" title="">[129]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>Greek literature abounds with scenes of slaves being flogged; it was a means of forcing them to work, as was control of rations, clothing, and rest. This violence could be meted out by the master as well as the supervisor, who was possibly also a slave. Thus, at the beginning of <a href="/wiki/Aristophanes" id="w">Aristophanes</a>&#39; <i><a href="/wiki/The_Knights" id="w">The Knights</a></i> (4–5), two slaves complain of being &#34;bruised and thrashed without respite&#34; by their new supervisor. However, Aristophanes himself cites what is a typical old saw in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek_comedy" id="w">Ancient Greek comedy</a>:
</p><blockquote> 
<p>&#34;He also dismissed those slaves who kept on running off, or deceiving someone, or getting whipped. They were always led out crying, so one of their fellow slaves could mock the bruises and ask then: &#39;Oh you poor miserable fellow, what&#39;s happened to your skin? Surely a huge army of lashes from a whip has fallen down on you and laid waste your back?&#39;&#34;<sup id="_ref-130" class="reference"><a href="#_note-130" title="">[130]</a></sup>
</p></blockquote> 
 
<p>In fact, the condition of slaves varied very much according to their status; the mine slaves of Laureion and the <i><a href="/wiki/Prostitution_in_ancient_Greece" id="w">pornai</a></i> (brother prostitutes) lived a particularly brutal existence, while public slaves, craftsmen, tradesmen and bankers enjoyed relative independence.<sup id="_ref-131" class="reference"><a href="#_note-131" title="">[131]</a></sup> In return for a fee ({{polytonic}} / <i>apophora</i>) paid to their master, they could live and work alone.<sup id="_ref-132" class="reference"><a href="#_note-132" title="">[132]</a></sup> They could thus earn some money on the side, sometimes enough to purchase their freedom. Potential emancipation was indeed a powerful motivator, though the real scale of this is difficult to estimate.<sup id="_ref-133" class="reference"><a href="#_note-133" title="">[133]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ancient writers considered that Attic slaves enjoyed a “peculiarly happy lot”:<sup id="_ref-134" class="reference"><a href="#_note-134" title="">[134]</a></sup> Pseudo-Xenophon deplores the liberties taken by Athenian slaves: &#34;as for the slaves and Metics of Athens, they take the greatest licence; you cannot just strike them, and they do not step aside to give you free passage&#34;.<sup id="_ref-135" class="reference"><a href="#_note-135" title="">[135]</a></sup> This alleged good treatment did not prevent 20,000 Athenian slaves from running away at the end of the <a href="/wiki/Peloponnesian_War" id="w">Peloponnesian War</a> at the incitement of the Spartan garrison at <a href="/wiki/Attica" id="w">Attica</a> in <a href="/wiki/Decelea" id="w">Decelea</a>.<sup id="_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="#_note-136" title="">[136]</a></sup> These were principally skilled artisans (<i>kheirotekhnai</i>), probably amongst the better-treated slaves. The title of a 4th-century comedy by <a href="/wiki/Antiphanes" id="w">Antiphanes</a>, <i>The Runaway-catcher</i> ({{polytonic}}),<sup id="_ref-137" class="reference"><a href="#_note-137" title="">[137]</a></sup> suggests that slave flight was not uncommon.<sup id="_ref-138" class="reference"><a href="#_note-138" title="">[138]</a></sup> Conversely, the absence of a large-scale Greek slave revolt comparable to that of <a href="/wiki/Spartacus" id="w">Spartacus</a> in <a href="/wiki/Rome" id="w">Rome</a>, for instance, can undoubtedly be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. It should be noted though that slave revolts were rare, even in Rome or the American South. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, even if scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not twelve years old.<sup id="_ref-139" class="reference"><a href="#_note-139" title="">[139]</a></sup></p>

<p>No author of Antiquity calls the existence of slavery into question; at most, they admit that certain slaves may have been unjustly enslaved. To <a href="/wiki/Homer" id="w">Homer</a> and the pre-classical authors, slavery was an inevitable consequence of war. <a href="/wiki/Heraclitus" id="w">Heraclitus</a> states that &#34;War is the father of all, the king of all ... he turns some into slaves and sets others free&#34;.<sup id="_ref-140" class="reference"><a href="#_note-140" title="">[140]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>During the classical period, the main justification for slavery was economic.<sup id="_ref-141" class="reference"><a href="#_note-141" title="">[141]</a></sup> From a moral point of view, the idea of &#34;natural&#34; slavery emerged at the same time; thus, as <a href="/wiki/Aeschylus" id="w">Aeschylus</a> states in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Persians" id="w">The Persians</a></i>, the Greeks &#34;[o]f no man are they called the slaves or vassals&#34;,<sup id="_ref-142" class="reference"><a href="#_note-142" title="">[142]</a></sup> while the <a href="/wiki/Persian_people" id="w">Persians</a>, as <a href="/wiki/Euripides" id="w">Euripides</a> states in <i><a href="/wiki/Helen_(play)" id="w">Helen</a></i>, &#34;are all slaves, except one&#34; — the <a href="/wiki/Great_King" id="w">Great King</a>.<sup id="_ref-143" class="reference"><a href="#_note-143" title="">[143]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Hippocrates" id="w">Hippocrates</a> theorizes about this latent idea at the end of the <a href="/wiki/5th_century_BC" id="w">5th century BC</a>. According to him, the temperate climate of <a href="/wiki/Anatolia" id="w">Anatolia</a> produced a placid and submissive people.<sup id="_ref-144" class="reference"><a href="#_note-144" title="">[144]</a></sup> This explanation is reprised by <a href="/wiki/Plato" id="w">Plato</a>,<sup id="_ref-145" class="reference"><a href="#_note-145" title="">[145]</a></sup> then <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" id="w">Aristotle</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Politics_(Aristotle)" id="w">Politics</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-146" class="reference"><a href="#_note-146" title="">[146]</a></sup> where he develops the concept of &#34;natural slavery&#34;: &#34;for he that can foresee with his mind is naturally ruler and naturally master, and he that can do these things with his body is subject and naturally a slave.&#34;<sup id="_ref-147" class="reference"><a href="#_note-147" title="">[147]</a></sup> As opposed to an animal, a slave can comprehend reason but &#34;…has not got the deliberative part at all.&#34;<sup id="_ref-148" class="reference"><a href="#_note-148" title="">[148]</a></sup></p>
<p>In parallel, the concept that all men, whether Greek or barbarian, belonged to the same race was being developed by the <a href="/wiki/Sophism" id="w">Sophists</a><sup id="_ref-149" class="reference"><a href="#_note-149" title="">[149]</a></sup> and thus that certain men were slaves although they had the soul of a freeman and vice versa.<sup id="_ref-150" class="reference"><a href="#_note-150" title="">[150]</a></sup> Aristotle himself recognized this possibility and argued that slavery could not be imposed unless the master was better than the slave, in keeping with his theory of &#34;natural&#34; slavery.<sup id="_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#_note-151" title="">[151]</a></sup> The Sophists concluded that true servitude was not a matter of status but a matter of spirit; thus, as <a href="/wiki/Menander" id="w">Menander</a> stated, “be free in the mind, although you are slave: and thus you will no longer be a slave”.<sup id="_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#_note-152" title="">[152]</a></sup> This idea, repeated by the <a href="/wiki/Stoicism" id="w">Stoics</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Epicurianism" id="w">Epicurians</a>, was not so much an opposition to slavery as a trivialisation of it.<sup id="_ref-153" class="reference"><a href="#_note-153" title="">[153]</a></sup></p> 
<p>The Greeks could not comprehend an absence of slaves. Slaves exist even in the &#34;<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Cloudcuckooland">Cloudcuckooland</a>&#34; of Artistophanes&#39; <i><a href="/wiki/The_Birds_(play)" id="w">The Birds</a></i> as well as in the ideal cities of Plato&#39;s <i>Laws</i> or <i>Republic</i>.<sup id="_ref-154" class="reference"><a href="#_note-154" title="">[154]</a></sup> The utopian cities of <a href="/wiki/Phaleas_of_Chalcedon" id="w">Phaleas of Chalcedon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hippodamus_of_Miletus" id="w">Hippodamus of Miletus</a> are based on the equal distribution of property, but public slaves are used respectively as craftsmen<sup id="_ref-155" class="reference"><a href="#_note-155" title="">[155]</a></sup> and land workers.<sup id="_ref-156" class="reference"><a href="#_note-156" title="">[156]</a></sup> The &#34;reversed cities&#34; placed women in power or even saw the end of private property, as in <i><a href="/wiki/Lysistrata" id="w">Lysistrata</a></i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Assemblywomen" id="w">Assemblywomen</a></i>, but could not picture slaves in charge of masters. The only societies without slaves were those of the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Age" id="w">Golden Age</a>, where all needs were met. In this type of society, as explained by Plato,<sup id="_ref-157" class="reference"><a href="#_note-157" title="">[157]</a></sup> one reaped generously without sowing. In Telekleides&#39; <i>Amphictyons</i><sup id="_ref-158" class="reference"><a href="#_note-158" title="">[158]</a></sup> barley loaves fight with wheat loaves for the honour of being eaten by men. Moreover, objects move themselves—dough kneads itself, and the jug pours itself. Society without slaves is thus relegated to a different time and space. In a &#34;normal&#34; society, one needs slaves.</p>

Slavery in Greek antiquity has long been an object of <a href="/wiki/Apologetics" id="w">apologetic</a> discourse among Christians, who awarded themselves the merit of its collapse. From the <a href="/wiki/16th_century" id="w">16th century</a> the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of <a href="/wiki/Colonialism" id="w">colonial</a> slavery had significant impact on the debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds.<sup id="_ref-159" class="reference"><a href="#_note-159" title="">[159]</a></sup> Thus <a href="/wiki/Henri_Wallon" id="w">Henri Wallon</a> in 1847 published a <i>History of Slavery in Antiquity</i> amongst his works for the <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism" id="w">abolition of slavery</a> in the <a href="/wiki/French_colonial_empires" id="w">French colonies</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/19th_century" id="w">19th century</a> a politico-economic discourse emerged. It concerned itself with distinguishing the phases in the organisation of human societies and correctly identifying the place of Greek slavery. The influence of <a href="/wiki/Marx" id="w">Marx</a> is decisive; for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the dominant (and not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of slavery as a <a href="/wiki/Mode_of_production" id="w">mode of production</a>.<sup id="_ref-160" class="reference"><a href="#_note-160" title="">[160]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Positivism" id="w">Positivists</a> represented by the historian <a href="/wiki/Eduard_Meyer" id="w">Eduard Meyer</a> (<i>Slavery in Antiquity</i>, <a href="/wiki/1898" id="w">1898</a>) were soon to oppose the <a href="/wiki/Marxism" id="w">Marxist</a> theory. According to him slavery was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social phenomena, and not economic.<sup id="_ref-161" class="reference"><a href="#_note-161" title="">[161]</a></sup> Current historiography developed in the <a href="/wiki/20th_century" id="w">20th century</a>. Led by authors such as Joseph Vogt, it saw in slavery the conditions for the development of elites. Conversely, the theory also demonstrates an opportunity for slaves to join the elite. Finally, Vogt estimates that modern society, founded on humanist values, has surpassed this level of development.<sup id="_ref-162" class="reference"><a href="#_note-162" title="">[162]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>In 2007, Greek slavery remains the subject of historiographical debate, on two questions in particular: Can it be said that ancient Greece was a &#34;slave society&#34;? Did Greek slaves comprise a <a href="/wiki/Social_class" id="w">social class</a>?<sup id="_ref-163" class="reference"><a href="#_note-163" title="">[163]</a></sup></p>
