<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> History </h2>
<p><b>Early history</b></p>
<p>The company originally sold only <a href="/wiki/Bleach" id="w">bleach</a> and <a href="/wiki/Potassium_bromide" id="w">potassium bromide</a>, achieving a daily bleach output of 72 tons a day in 1902. Early in the company&#39;s existence, a group of <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> manufacturers attempted to drive Dow out of the bleach business by cutting prices. Dow survived by cutting prices in response and, although losing about $90,000 in income, began to diversify its <a href="/wiki/Product_line" id="w">product line</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> In 1905 German bromide producers drastically reduced their price of bromides in the US in an effort to prevent Dow from expanding its sales of bromides in Europe. Dow was able to purchase German-made bromides in the US, ship them back to Europe and still sell them at a lower price than the German producers were charging. <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Even in its early history, the company set a tradition of rapidly diversifying its <a href="/wiki/Product_line" id="w">product line</a>.  Within twenty years, Dow had become a major producer of <a href="/wiki/Agricultural" id="w">agricultural</a> chemicals, elemental <a href="/wiki/Chlorine" id="w">chlorine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phenol" id="w">phenol</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Dye" id="w">dyestuffs</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Magnesium" id="w">magnesium</a> metal.</p>
<p><b>Diversification into plastics</b></p>
<p>In the 1930s, Dow began production of plastic resins, which would grow to become one of the corporation&#39;s major businesses.  Its first plastic products were <a href="/wiki/Ethylcellulose" id="w">ethylcellulose</a>, made in 1935, and <a href="/wiki/Polystyrene" id="w">polystyrene</a>, made in 1937.</p>
<p><b>WW II - Magnesium and the beginnings of geographic diversification</b></p>
<p>In 1940-1, Dow built its first plant to produce <a href="/wiki/Magnesium" id="w">magnesium</a> extracted from <a href="/wiki/Seawater" id="w">seawater</a> rather than underground brine. This marked the first time man had &#39;mined the ocean for metal&#39;.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/history.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/history.htm">http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/history.htm</a> </p>
<p>Growth of this business made Dow a strategically important business during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, as magnesium became important in fabricating lightweight parts for <a href="/wiki/Aircraft" id="w">aircraft</a>.  Also during the war, Dow and <a href="/wiki/Corning_Glass_Works" id="w">Corning</a> began their joint venture, <a href="/wiki/Dow_Corning" id="w">Dow Corning</a>, to produce <a href="/wiki/Silicone" id="w">silicones</a> for military and later civilian use. In 1942 Dow began its foreign expansion with the formation of Dow Chemical of Canada in <a href="/wiki/Sarnia%2C_Ontario" id="w">Sarnia, Ontario</a> to produce <a href="/wiki/Styrene" id="w">styrene</a> for use in <a href="/wiki/Styrene-butadiene" id="w">styrene-butadiene</a> <a href="/wiki/Synthetic_rubber" id="w">synthetic rubber</a>.</p>
<p><b>Freeport - Texas Operations</b></p>
<p>In 1940, Dow began plant construction in Freeport, Texas. This is now the home to Dow&#39;s largest site - and one of the largest integrated chemical manufacturing sites in the world. One of the first plants to come on stream was the first facility to extract magnesium from seawater. The site grew quickly - with power, chlorine, caustic soda and ethylene also soon in production.  <a class="externallink" href="http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/history.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/history.htm">http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/history.htm</a></p>
<p>Based on 2002-2003 data, the Freeport plants (known as Texas Operations internally) produced 27 billion pounds of product - or 21% of Dow&#39;s global production. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/facts.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/facts.htm">http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/facts.htm</a></p>
<p><b>Post WW II</b></p>
<p>In the post-war era, Dow began expanding outside North America, founding its first overseas subsidiary in <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_Japan" id="w">Japan</a> in 1952, with several other nations following rapidly thereafter.  Based largely on its growing plastics business, it opened a consumer products division beginning with Saran wrap in 1953.  Based on its growing chemicals and plastics businesses, Dow&#39;s sales exceeded $1 billion in 1964, $2 billion in 1971, and $10 billion in 1980.</p>
<p><b>The 1990&#39;s - transition from geographic alignment to global business units</b></p>
<p>In the early 1990s, Dow embarked on a major structural reorganization. The former reporting hierarchy was geographic based, with the regional president reporting directly to the overall company President and CEO. The new organization groups together the same businesses from different sites, irrespective of which region they belong (i.e. the vice president for Polystyrene is now in charge of these plants all over the word), almost reducing the regional president to a figurehead.  </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/William_S._Stavropoulos" id="w">Bill Stavropoulos</a> served as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1995-2000 and again from 2002-2004. He relinquished his board seat on April 1, 2006, having been a director since 1990 and chairman since 2000. During his first tenure, he led the purchase of <a href="/wiki/Union_Carbide" id="w">Union Carbide</a> which had proven controversial, as it was initially blamed for poor results under his successor as CEO Mike Parker. Parker was dismissed and Stavropoulos returned from retirement to lead a turnaround of Dow.<a class="externallink" href="http://news.dow.com/corporate/2005/20051213a.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.dow.com/corporate/2005/20051213a.htm">http://news.dow.com/corporate/2005/20051213a.htm</a></p>
<p>Today, Dow is the world&#39;s largest producer of plastics; with its 2001 acquisition of <a href="/wiki/Union_Carbide" id="w">Union Carbide</a>, it has become a major player in the <a href="/wiki/Petrochemical" id="w">petrochemical</a> industry as well.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> Dow announced that it had plans to close facilities at three locations:<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul>
<li>It will shut down all of its production in <a href="/wiki/Sarnia%2C_Ontario" id="w">Sarnia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ontario" id="w">Ontario</a> by the end of 2008. Sarnia had been Dow&#39;s first manufacturing site in Canada. In 1942, the Canadian government invited Dow to build a plant there to produce styrene (an essential raw material used to make synthetic rubber for <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>). Dow then built a polystyrene plant in 1947. Up to the early 1990s, the Chemical Valley site contained numerous plants, while Dow Canada&#39;s headquarters were located at the <a href="/wiki/Highway_40_(Ontario)" id="w">Modeland Centre</a>, and a new River Centre complex was opened which housed Research and Development. Since then, several plants on the site have been dismantled and Dow Canada headquarters were moved to <a href="/wiki/Calgary" id="w">Calgary</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alberta" id="w">Alberta</a>, while the Dow Fitness Centre was donated to YMCA of Sarnia-Lambton, and the Modeland Centre was sold to Lambton County and the City of Sarnia. In 2000, Sarnia Site was the location of a pilot plant for ethylene-styrene interpolymer (ESI) but ending up production never progressed and the project was ended. In 2002, the old steam plant was demolished and land on the site was sold to <a href="/wiki/TransAlta" id="w">TransAlta</a> which built a new natural gas power plant. As of 2003, the remaining plants on the site produce Polystyrene, Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Epoxy Resins, Polyols (Propylene Oxide Derivatives), and Latexes.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.dow.com/publicreport/2003/local/sarnia/letter.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.dow.com/publicreport/2003/local/sarnia/letter.htm">http://www.dow.com/publicreport/2003/local/sarnia/letter.htm</a></li>

<p>{{main article}}
In 1984, a chemical factory operated by <a href="/wiki/Union_Carbide" id="w">Union Carbide</a>, an American company, leaked 40 tonnes of lethal <a href="/wiki/Methyl_isocyanate" id="w">methyl isocyanate</a> (MIC) gas into the surrounding environment, which has caused more than 20,000 deaths and 100,000 disabilities.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>In 1991, The Supreme Court of India upheld a US $470 million civil settlement. The court required the Indian government to use the money to fund a group medical plan for up to 100,000 persons who might develop symptoms at a later date, and dismissed all petitions challenging the settlement. In 1994, Union Carbide sold its interest in Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL).<a class="externallink" href="http://www.bhopal.com/chrono.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bhopal.com/chrono.htm">http://www.bhopal.com/chrono.htm</a> </p>
<p>In 1999, Dow purchased Union Carbide, which is now a <a href="/wiki/Wholly_owned_subsidiary" id="w">wholly owned subsidiary</a>. Dow denies legal liability for the disaster, since it did not own or operate the Bhopal factory.

</p><a id="Chlorpyrifos" name="Chlorpyrifos"></a><h4>Chlorpyrifos</h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Chlorpyrifos" id="w">Chlorpyrifos</a>, marketed by Dow as Dursban, is well known as a home and garden <a href="/wiki/Insecticide" id="w">insecticide</a>, and until 2000 it was one of the most widely used household <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" id="w">pesticide</a> in the US.  The pesticide is also a nerve toxin and suspected <a href="/wiki/Endocrine_disruptor" id="w">endocrine disruptor</a> and has been associated with <a href="/wiki/Carcinogenicity" id="w">carcinogenicity</a>, reproductive and developmental <a href="/wiki/Toxicity" id="w">toxicity</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Acute_toxicity" id="w">acute toxicity</a>. One study claims that Dow has contributed to 80% of the Chlorpyrifos burden of the US.</p>
<p>In 1995, Dow was fined $732,000 for not sending the EPA reports it had received on 249 Dursban poisoning incidents. In June 2000, Dow withdrew registration of chlorpyrifos for use in homes and other places where children could be exposed, and severely restricted its use on crops. The company, however, continues to market Dursban in industrializing countries, including India, where Dow&#39;s sales literature claimed Dursban has &#34;an established record of safety regarding humans and pets.&#34;</p>
<p>In 2003, Dow agreed to pay $2 million - the largest penalty ever in a pesticide case - to the state of New York, in response to a lawsuit filed by the Attorney General to end Dow&#39;s illegal advertising of Dursban as &#34;safe&#34;.</p>
<a id="Energy_Conservation" name="Energy_Conservation"></a><h4>Energy Conservation</h4>
<p>On 2007, Dow was awarded an American Chemical Council (ACC) award of &#39;Exceptional Merit&#39; in recognition of its longstanding energy efficiency and conservation efforts. Between 1995 and 2005, Dow reduced energy intensity (BTU per pound produced) by 22%. This is equivalent to saving enough electricity to power eight million US homes for a year. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.csrwire.com/News/8515.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.csrwire.com/News/8515.html">http://www.csrwire.com/News/8515.html</a></p>

More lawsuits, as well as <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration" id="w">Food and Drug Administration</a> reviews, <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" id="w">Congressional</a> hearings, and scientific studies took place in the ensuing years; as of December 1991, 137 individual lawsuits were filed against Dow Corning, a figure that would rise to 3,558 in December 1992, and 19,092 by December 1994. Amidst the flurry of lawsuits in May 1995, Dow Corning filed for <a href="/wiki/Chapter_11" id="w">Chapter 11</a> bankruptcy protection; several judgments against Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were handed down in lawsuits.</p>
<p>Several panels of independent experts, including the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Medicine" id="w">Institute of Medicine</a>, have since found that silicone breast implants do not appear to cause any systemic diseases or cancers. <sup id="_ref-nyt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nyt" title="">[19]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-frontline_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-frontline" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

In 2005, a lawsuit was filed by Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange against Dow and <a href="/wiki/Monsanto" id="w">Monsanto</a>, which also supplied Agent Orange to the military.

<a id="DBCP" name="DBCP"></a><h4>DBCP</h4>
<p>Until the late 1970&#39;s Dow produced <a href="/wiki/DBCP" id="w">DBCP</a> (1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane), a soil fumigant and <a href="/wiki/Nematicide" id="w">nematicide</a> sold under the names the Nemagon and Fumazone. Workers at Dow&#39;s DBCP production were made sterile by exposure to DBCP. These male reproductive effects were consistent with animal experiments showing that DBCP sterilized rabbits. The workers successfully sued the company, and most domestic uses of the chemical were banned in 1977. Amid growing concerns over DBCP&#39;s effects on male workers, Dow ceased production and reclaimed DBCP that had been shipped to its users. Despite warning from the company about its health effects, <a href="/wiki/Dole_Food_Company" id="w">Dole Food Company</a>, who was using the chemical on its <a href="/wiki/Banana" id="w">banana</a> plantations in <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" id="w">Latin America</a>, threatened to sue Dow if it stopped DCBP shipments, so Dow shipped half a million gallons of DBCP to Dole, much it reclaimed from other users. Plantation workers who became sterile or were stricken with other maladies subsequently sued both Dow and Dole in Latin American courts, alleging that their ailments were caused by DCBP exposure. While the courts agreed with the workers and awarded them over $600 million in damages, they have been unable to collect payments from the companies. A group of workers then sued in the United States, and, on <a href="/wiki/November_5" id="w">November 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, a Los Angeles jury awarded them 3.2 million dollars. Dole and Dow vowed to appeal the decision.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

The stadium (which opens in April 2007) is called <a href="/wiki/Dow_Diamond" id="w">Dow Diamond</a>.

<a id="Outlook" name="Outlook"></a><h2>Outlook</h2>
<p>{{future}}
Dow CEO <a href="/wiki/Andrew_N._Liveris" id="w">Andrew N. Liveris</a> called 2005 the company&#39;s &#34;best year ever&#34; with operating profits of $5.4 billion, a jump of 56.5% compared with the previous year. <sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup>  Net income rose more than 60% to $4.5 billion, on sales of $46.3 billion.  2006 looks as if it could be even better, with first-quarter net earnings of $1.2 billion. <sup id="_ref-liveris_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-liveris" title="">[32]</a></sup>  All this is occurring in the context of adverse operating conditions, caused by high energy and raw material costs, and the effects of two damaging hurricanes.</p>
<p>Liveris supports the vertically integrated approach used at Dow, which produces everything from basic chemical feedstocks to high value products such as pesticides and reverse osmosis membranes.  These value-adding product chains, along with Dow&#39;s wide product range, help the company to weather the storms of the global economy.  Despite this, high energy and feedstock costs may begin to take their toll, particularly if global demand begins to fall just as supply is rising.</p>
<p>Like many chemical companies, Dow is facing pressures of regulation in the US and <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union" id="w">Europe</a>, particularly as the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" id="w">EU</a> introduces its new <a href="/wiki/Registration%2C_Evaluation_and_Authorisation_of_Chemicals" id="w">REACH</a> policy.  Litigation costs in the US taken over by Dow as a result of its 2001 takeover of <a href="/wiki/Union_Carbide" id="w">Union Carbide</a> also remain a concern.  </p>
<p>For these reasons the company is looking to the Middle East and Asia for new projects.  In <a href="/wiki/Kuwait" id="w">Kuwait</a> , Dow is constructing (with <a href="/wiki/Petrochemical_Industries_Company" id="w">PIC of Kuwait</a>) a new world-scale <a href="/wiki/Petroleum_cracking" id="w">ethane cracker</a> for production of <a href="/wiki/Ethylene" id="w">ethylene</a>, along with an <a href="/wiki/Ethylene_oxide" id="w">ethylene oxide</a>/<a href="/wiki/Ethylene_glycol" id="w">ethylene glycol</a> plant and (for 2008) a facility for production of <a href="/wiki/Aromatic_hydrocarbon" id="w">aromatic hydrocarbons</a>.  In <a href="/wiki/Oman" id="w">Oman</a>, the company is working with the Oman government to build a new world-scale <a href="/wiki/Polyethylene" id="w">polyethylene</a> plant.  In China, the company is collaborating with <a href="/wiki/Shenhua_Group" id="w">Shenhua Group</a> (the country&#39;s largest <a href="/wiki/Coal_mining" id="w">coal mining</a> company) to improve <a href="/wiki/Catalyst" id="w">catalyst</a> efficiency to allow viable conversion of <a href="/wiki/Coal" id="w">coal</a> to <a href="/wiki/Alkene" id="w">olefins</a>.  Dow is also seeking to expand its <a href="/wiki/Research_and_development" id="w">R&#38;D</a> presence in Asia, adding 600 jobs in <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" id="w">Shanghai</a> by the end of 2007, and the company may open up a large R&#38;D center in India. </p>
<p>The joint ventures planned for Asia are typical of Dow&#39;s &#34;asset-light&#34; approach, which works by offering a combination of intellectual property and money in exchange for a share in a world-scale production facility.  At the same time, the company is considering selling a share of some of its existing assets in order to free up cash.  </p>
<p>In June 2006 Liveris announced Dow&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Safety" id="w">safety</a> and <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" id="w">environmental</a> goals for 2015: <sup id="_ref-liveris_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-liveris" title="">[32]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul>
<li>75% reduction in environmental, health and safety indicators from 2005. The company aims to have no fatalities, and a reduction in injuries, spillages and leaks.</li>
<li>25% increase in <a href="/wiki/Energy_efficiency" id="w">energy efficiency</a>.</li>
<li>2.5% annual reduction in <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" id="w">greenhouse gas</a> emissions intensity.</li></ul>
<p>Liveris expects these goals to be reached predominantly with <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" id="w">fossil fuels</a>, through <a href="/wiki/Energy_conservation" id="w">energy conservation</a> and reduction of <a href="/wiki/Energy_intensity" id="w">energy intensity</a>, as he does not expect <a href="/wiki/Alternative_energy" id="w">alternative energy</a> to play a major role for at least 10-20 years.</p>
