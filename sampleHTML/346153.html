<p>The <b>Columbia River Highway</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Highway" id="w">highway</a> built in the <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">U.S. state</a> of <a href="/wiki/Oregon" id="w">Oregon</a> along the <a href="/wiki/Columbia_River" id="w">Columbia River</a> between 1913 and 1922. When the <a href="/wiki/Multnomah_County%2C_Oregon" id="w">Multnomah County</a> portion was first paved in 1916, it was the first major paved <a href="/wiki/Highway" id="w">highway</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Northwest" id="w">Pacific Northwest</a>. Once completed, it ran from <a href="/wiki/Astoria%2C_Oregon" id="w">Astoria</a> to <a href="/wiki/The_Dalles%2C_Oregon" id="w">The Dalles</a>, a total of 196 miles. It is an <a href="/wiki/All-American_Road" id="w">All-American Road</a>.</p>
<p>The original highway was promoted by lawyer and entrepreneur <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Hill" id="w">Sam Hill</a> and engineer <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Lancaster" id="w">Samuel Lancaster</a>, to be modeled after the great scenic roads of <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>. From the very beginning, the roadway was envisioned not just as means of traveling by the then popular <a href="/wiki/Model_T" id="w">Model T</a>, but designed with an elegance that took full advantage of all the natural beauty along the route.</p>
<p>When the <a href="/wiki/United_States_highway" id="w">United States highway</a> system was officially established in 1926, the highway became the first and then westernmost segment of what became <a href="/wiki/U.S._Route_30" id="w">U.S. Route 30</a>. Since then, modern <a href="/wiki/Interstate_84_(west)" id="w">Interstate 84</a> has been built parallel to the highway between <a href="/wiki/Portland%2C_Oregon" id="w">Portland</a> and The Dalles, replacing it as the main travel route and resulting in the loss of some of the original sections of road.</p>
<p>Today, the modern Columbia River Highway (<b>Highway 2</b>) uses I-84 from Portland to east of <a href="/wiki/Boardman%2C_Oregon" id="w">Boardman</a>, and then <a href="/wiki/U.S._Route_730" id="w">U.S. Route 730</a> northeast to the <a href="/wiki/Washington" id="w">Washington</a> state line. There is also a <b>Lower Columbia River Highway</b> (<b>Highway 2W</b>, sometimes <b>Highway 92</b>), using U.S. 30 from <a href="/wiki/Astoria%2C_Oregon" id="w">Astoria</a> to Portland. Between <a href="/wiki/Troutdale%2C_Oregon" id="w">Troutdale</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Dalles%2C_Oregon" id="w">The Dalles</a>, much of the original highway is part of the <b>Historic Columbia River Highway</b> (<b>Highway 100</b>.)</p>

<p>Modern highways, including I-84, and other developments have resulted in the abandonment of major sections of the historic original highway. In the interest of <a href="/wiki/Tourism" id="w">tourism</a> and historical preservation, seventy-four miles of the original road—from Troutdale to The Dalles—have been established as the <b>Historic Columbia River Highway</b> (HCRH). Forty miles of the route are open to motor vehicles:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The 24 westernmost miles starting in <a href="/wiki/Troutdale%2C_Oregon" id="w">Troutdale</a> (at the eastern edge of urban <a href="/wiki/Portland%2C_Oregon" id="w">Portland</a>) provide access to dozens of hiking trails, <a href="/wiki/Crown_Point%2C_Oregon" id="w">Crown Point</a> Vista House, and numerous <a href="/wiki/Waterfall" id="w">waterfalls</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Multnomah_Falls" id="w">Multnomah Falls</a>. This section forms a loop with the <a href="/wiki/Mount_Hood_Scenic_Byway" id="w">Mount Hood Scenic Byway</a>.</li>
<li>The 16 easternmost miles ending in The Dalles.</li></ul>
<p>The remaining portions of the HCRH designated for non-motorized use are now known as the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail. These are being developed as money becomes available. Roughly seven miles between <a href="/wiki/Hood_River%2C_Oregon" id="w">Hood River</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mosier%2C_Oregon" id="w">Mosier</a> have been open to non-motorized traffic since 2000, passing through the historic Mosier Tunnels.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Once restoration is complete, the highway will serve as a scenic and alternative bicycle route for I-84 and US-30 between The Dalles and Portland. Currently, cyclists wishing to travel between these two towns must ride on the shoulders of I-84 for much of the distance, or the much more dangerous and narrow <a href="/wiki/State_Route_14_(Washington)" id="w">State Route 14</a> on the Washington side of the river.</p>
<p>The Columbia River Highway is the nation&#39;s oldest scenic highway. In 1984 it was recognized as a <a href="/wiki/List_of_historic_civil_engineering_landmarks#United States landmarks" id="w">National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark</a> by the <a href="/wiki/American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers" id="w">American Society of Civil Engineers</a>. In 2000 it was designated a <a href="/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark" id="w">National Historic Landmark</a> by the <a href="/wiki/National_Park_Service" id="w">National Park Service</a> as &#34;an outstanding example of modern highway development&#34;.</p>
