Gregory Magnus House, was born to John and Blythe House.<sup id="_ref-no reason_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-no reason" title="">[7]</a></sup> His <a href="/wiki/Social_security_number" id="w">social security number</a> was issued in <a href="/wiki/Ohio" id="w">Ohio</a>.<sup id="_ref-no reason_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-no reason" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> House is a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Military_brat_(U.S._subculture)" id="w">military brat</a>&#34;, as his father served as a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" id="w">Marine Corps</a> pilot and transferred often to other bases during House&#39;s childhood.<sup id="_ref-daddy's boy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-daddy's boy" title="">[9]</a></sup> House presumably picked up his affinity for languages during this period, and shows a level of understanding of <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" id="w">Spanish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_language" id="w">Portuguese</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mandarin_(linguistics)" id="w">Mandarin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_language" id="w">Japanese</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hindi" id="w">Hindi</a>. One place his father was stationed was in <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>, where House developed a passing fascination with <a href="/wiki/Archaeology" id="w">archaeology</a> and treasure-hunting, an interest which led him to keep his treasure-hunting tools well into his adulthood.<sup id="_ref-clueless_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clueless" title="">[10]</a></sup> Another station was <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>, where, at age 14, House discovered his vocation after witnessing a <a href="/wiki/Burakumin" id="w">buraku</a> doctor solve a case no other doctor could handle.<sup id="_ref-comaguy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-comaguy" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Dr. House loves his mother but hates his father, who he claims has an &#34;insane moral compass.&#34; House avoids both parents and spends an entire episode dodging a night out with them. At one point, House tells a story of his parents leaving him with his grandmother whose punishments constituted <a href="/wiki/Child_abuse" id="w">abuse</a>. He later confesses that it was his father who abused him.<sup id="_ref-oneday_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oneday" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>After receiving his <a href="/wiki/Undergraduate_education" id="w">undergraduate</a> degree at <a href="/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University" id="w">Johns Hopkins University</a>, House studied medicine at <a href="/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University_School_of_Medicine" id="w">Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</a>, researching psychiatry and behavioral sciences until classmate Phillip Weber reported House for copying exam answers from him.<sup id="_ref-distractions_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-distractions" title="">[13]</a></sup> Following his expulsion from Johns Hopkins, he applied and was accepted to the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Michigan" id="w">University of Michigan</a> at <a href="/wiki/Ann_Arbor%2C_Michigan" id="w">Ann Arbor</a> where he received his <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine" id="w">M.D.</a> and met <a href="/wiki/Lisa_Cuddy" id="w">Lisa Cuddy</a>, his future boss.<sup id="_ref-humpty_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-humpty" title="">[14]</a></sup> There is a degree of <a href="/wiki/Sexual_tension" id="w">sexual tension</a> between the two characters due to a one-night stand in the past.<sup id="_ref-topsecret_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-topsecret" title="">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>About ten years before the series began, House entered into a relationship with Stacy Warner, a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_law" id="w">constitutional lawyer</a>. They met at a &#34;Doctors vs Lawyers&#34; paint ball event where she shot him. Five years later, he suffered an <a href="/wiki/Infarction" id="w">infarction</a> in his right leg, which went undiagnosed for three days due to doctors&#39; concerns that he was exhibiting drug seeking behavior (House was also unable to diagnose his own infarction). An <a href="/wiki/Aneurysm" id="w">aneurysm</a> in his thigh had clotted, leading to an infarction and causing his <a href="/wiki/Quadriceps_femoris_muscle" id="w">quadriceps</a> muscles to become <a href="/wiki/Necrosis" id="w">necrotic</a>. House had the dead muscle bypassed in order to restore circulation to the remainder of his leg, risking organ failure and cardiac arrest. He was willing to endure excruciating post operative pain to retain the use of his leg. After House was put into a chemically-induced <a href="/wiki/Coma" id="w">coma</a> to sleep through the worst of the pain, Stacy decided to choose a safer surgical middle-ground procedure between <a href="/wiki/Amputation" id="w">amputation</a> and a bypass by removing just the dead muscle. This resulted in the partial loss of use in his leg, and left House with a lesser, but still serious, level of pain for the rest of his life. House could not forgive Stacy for making the decision, so she left him.<sup id="_ref-threestories_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-threestories" title="">[16]</a></sup> </p>
<p>When Stacy makes her first appearance in the series, she is married to a high school guidance counselor named Mark Warner. Although House and Stacy grow closer together and reunite briefly during the second season, House tells Stacy to go back to her husband, which devastates her. Her character has not returned to the show since.</p>
<a id="Characterization" name="Characterization"></a><h2>Characterization</h2>
<p>House&#39;s character frequently shows his cunning and biting wit, enjoys picking people apart, and often mocks their weaknesses.<sup id="_ref-scorn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scorn" title="">[17]</a></sup> House accurately deciphers people&#39;s motives and histories from aspects of their personality and appearance.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/James_Wilson_(House)" id="w">Dr. James Wilson</a> once states in the episode &#34;<a href="/wiki/DNR_(House_episode)" id="w">DNR</a>&#34; that while &#34;some doctors have the <a href="/wiki/Messianic_complex" id="w">messiah complex</a> &#8212; they need to save the world&#34;, House has &#34;a <a href="/wiki/Rubik%26%2339%3Bs_Cube" id="w">Rubik&#39;s</a> complex&#34; &#8212; he needs &#34;to solve the puzzle.&#34; House typically waits as long as possible before meeting his patients.<sup id="_ref-scorn_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scorn" title="">[17]</a></sup> When he encounters his patients, House shows an unorthodox <a href="/wiki/Bedside_manner" id="w">bedside manner</a> and uses unconventional treatments. However, he impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses after seemingly not paying attention. This skill was demonstrated in an episode where House diagnoses an entire waiting room full of patients in under a minute on his way out of the hospital clinic. <sup id="_ref-sports_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sports" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>His crankiness is commonly attributed to the chronic pain in his leg (as a result of the <a href="/wiki/Infarction" id="w">infarction</a>) for which he requires the aid of a cane. According to Stacy Warner, his former girlfriend, he was &#34;pretty much the same&#34; before the infarction, and his boss Lisa Cuddy claimed that after the surgery he was &#34;an egomaniacal, narcissistic pain in the ass - same as before.&#34;<sup id="_ref-honeymoon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-honeymoon" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-needtoknow_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needtoknow" title="">[21]</a></sup> For his chronic leg pain, House takes <a href="/wiki/Vicodin" id="w">Vicodin</a> (<a href="/wiki/Hydrocodone" id="w">hydrocodone</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paracetamol" id="w">paracetamol</a> (acetaminophen)) on a daily basis, and as a result has developed an addiction to the drug.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> He concedes that he has an <a href="/wiki/Drug_addiction" id="w">addiction</a>, but says that the addiction is not a problem because it does not interfere with his work.<sup id="_ref-Detox_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Detox" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>House openly talks about and makes references to pornography.<sup id="_ref-Babies_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Babies" title="">[24]</a></sup> In one episode, he returns the flirtations of a female under age patient (&#34;<a href="/wiki/Lines_in_the_Sand_(House_episode)" id="w">Lines in the Sand</a>&#34;), and is seen on at least two occasions engaging the services of a prostitute.<sup id="_ref-distractions_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-distractions" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>He is a staunch <a href="/wiki/Atheist" id="w">atheist</a> and openly mocks colleagues or patients who express any level of belief in any aspect of religion.</p>
<p>House frequently says &#34;Everybody lies,&#34; but jokingly remarked that he was <a href="/wiki/Liar_paradox" id="w">lying when he said that</a> in the first season finale.<sup id="_ref-fullhouse_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fullhouse" title="">[25]</a></sup> House criticizes social etiquette for lack of rational purpose and usefulness. In one episode, he explains how he envies an autistic patient because society allows the patient to forgo the niceties that he must suffer through.</p>
<p>House is a strong non-conformist and gives little regard to how others perceive him.<sup id="_ref-badmood_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-badmood" title="">[26]</a></sup> Throughout the series, he displays sardonic contempt for authority figures. House shows an almost constant disregard for his own appearance, possessing a permanent stubble and dressing informally in jeans and t-shirt. He avoids wearing the standard white lab coat to avoid patients recognizing him to be a doctor.<sup id="_ref-pilot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pilot" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>House has a small social life and his only friend is <a href="/wiki/James_Wilson_(House)" id="w">Dr. James Wilson</a>.<sup id="_ref-badmood_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-badmood" title="">[26]</a></sup> Wilson knew House before the infarction, and looked after him when House&#39;s relationship with Stacy ended.<sup id="_ref-needtoknow_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needtoknow" title="">[21]</a></sup> Dr. Wilson&#39;s moving into House&#39;s apartment in &#34;<a href="/wiki/Sex_Kills" id="w">Sex Kills</a>&#34; symbolizes his taking emotional refuge in his friend.<sup id="_ref-Katie_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Katie" title="">[28]</a></sup> Although they frequently analyze and criticize each other&#39;s motives, Wilson has risked his career to protect House. House has quietly admitted, at several instances, that he is grateful for Wilson&#39;s presence, including referring to Wilson as his best friend.</p>
<a id="Casting" name="Casting"></a><h2>Casting</h2>
<p>Before Hugh Laurie auditioned for the role of Gregory House, he was filming <i><a href="/wiki/Flight_of_the_Phoenix_(2004_film)" id="w">Flight of the Phoenix</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/Namibia" id="w">Namibia</a>. Laurie planned to audition for the roles of both James Wilson and Gregory House. When Laurie read that Wilson was a character with a &#34;handsome open face,&#34; he decided to audition solely for the role of House.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> After watching casting tapes for the <a href="/wiki/Television_pilot" id="w">pilot episode</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bryan_Singer" id="w">Bryan Singer</a> grew frustrated and refused to consider any more British actors because of their flawed American accents.<sup id="_ref-badmood_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-badmood" title="">[26]</a></sup> However, when he saw Hugh Laurie&#39;s audition tape, not knowing who he was, Singer was fooled by Laurie&#39;s American accent. He mistook him as an American and praised Laurie as an example of a true American actor.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Laurie initially believed that James Wilson would be the protagonist of the show after reading the brief description of the character and did not find out that House was the main character until he read the full script of the pilot episode.<sup id="_ref-Inside_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Inside" title="">[31]</a></sup> Prior to the airing of the series, the producers were also concerned that Laurie lacked <a href="/wiki/Sex_appeal" id="w">sex appeal</a> to the viewers.<sup id="_ref-badmood_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-badmood" title="">[26]</a></sup> For his portrayal of Gregory House, Hugh Laurie has won <a href="/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Performance_by_an_Actor_In_A_Television_Series_-_Drama" id="w">Best Actor in a Television Drama Series</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Globe" id="w">Golden Globe</a> in 2006 and 2007, and <a href="/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Award_for_Outstanding_Performance_by_a_Male_Actor_in_a_Drama_Series" id="w">Best Actor from Drama Series</a> from <a href="/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards" id="w">Screen Actors Guild Awards</a>.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Concept_and_creation" name="Concept_and_creation"></a><h2>Concept and creation</h2>
<p>Hugh Laurie describes House as a character who refuses to &#34;obey the usual pieties of modern life&#34; and expects to find a rare diagnosis when he is treating his patient.<sup id="_ref-badmood_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-badmood" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-fullhouse_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fullhouse" title="">[25]</a></sup> As a <a href="/wiki/Protagonist" id="w">protagonist</a>, many aspects of his personality are the antithesis of what might be expected from a <a href="/wiki/Physician" id="w">doctor</a>.<sup id="_ref-scorn_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scorn" title="">[17]</a></sup> Producer Katie Jacobs views House as a static character who is accustomed to living in misery.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Jacobs has said that Dr. Wilson, his only friend in the show, and House both avoid mature relationships, which brings the two closer together.<sup id="_ref-messed up_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-messed up" title="">[34]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Robert_Sean_Leonard" id="w">Robert Sean Leonard</a> has said that Dr. Wilson is one of the few who voluntarily maintains a relationship with House, because his character is free to criticize him.<sup id="_ref-messed up_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-messed up" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite his sardonic personality, House is portrayed as a character who is reliant on people surrounding him.<sup id="_ref-fullhouse_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fullhouse" title="">[25]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Lisa_Edelstein" id="w">Lisa Edelstein</a> says this characteristic is portrayed in the third season, during which his medical career is at a jeopardy due to Detective Michael Tritter who arrests him for possessing narcotics.<sup id="_ref-fullhouse_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fullhouse" title="">[25]</a></sup> House&#39;s trouble ends thanks to <a href="/wiki/Lisa_Cuddy" id="w">Lisa Cuddy</a>&#39;s perjury during his hearing.</p>
<p>Adopting an American accent for his role has been difficult for Laurie, who says words such as &#34;coronary artery&#34; are particularly tricky to pronounce.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> The cane tricks that are seen throughout the series are created by Laurie himself.<sup id="_ref-messed up_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-messed up" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

Both men are musicians (House plays piano and guitar; Holmes plays violin) and both have a talent for accurately deciphering people&#39;s motives and histories from aspects of their personality and appearance.
