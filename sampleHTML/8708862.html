A <b>historic district</b> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> is a group of buildings, properties or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within a historic district are normally divided into two categories, <a href="/wiki/Contributing_property" id="w">contributing</a> and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size, some having hundreds of structures while others have just a few.</p>
<p>The U.S. federal government designates historic districts through the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Interior" id="w">U.S. Department of Interior</a>, under the auspices of the <a href="/wiki/National_Park_Service" id="w">National Park Service</a>. Federally designated historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. State Historic Districts can either follow similar criteria and have no restrictions on property owners or they can require strict adherence to historic rehabilitation standards. The local historic district offers, by far, the most legal protection for historic properties because most land use decisions are made at the local level. Local districts are generally administered by the county or municipal government. The tendency of local districts to place restrictions on property owners causes them to be the targets of the most resistance from the public.</p>
<p>The first historic district was located in <a href="/wiki/Charleston%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Charleston, South Carolina</a> and predated the first U.S. federal government designated district by more than thirty years. Other local historic districts popped up and in 1966 the <a href="/wiki/U.S._government" id="w">U.S. government</a> created the National Register of Historic Places on the heels of a report from the U.S. Conference of Mayors which stated Americans suffered from &#34;rootlessness.&#34;<sup id="_ref-datel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-datel" title="">[1]</a></sup>  By the 1980s there were thousands of federally designated historic districts.</p>

Historic districts are generally comprised of two types of properties, contributing and non-contributing.<sup id="_ref-sc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sc" title="">[2]</a></sup> Broadly defined, a contributing property is any property, structure or object which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make a historic district, listed locally or federally, significant.<sup id="_ref-Maine_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Maine" title="">[3]</a></sup> Different entities, usually governmental, at both the state and national level in the United States, have differing definitions of contributing property but they all retain the same basic characteristics.<sup id="_ref-Maine_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Maine" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-cali_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cali" title="">[4]</a></sup> In general, contributing properties are integral parts of the historic context and character of a historic district.<sup id="_ref-ic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ic" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the two types of classification within historic districts, properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are classified into five broad categories. They are, building, structure, site, district and object; each one has a specific definition in relation to the National Register. All but the eponymous district category are also applied to historic districts listed on the National Register.<sup id="_ref-nrhp_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

A listing on the National Register of Historic Places is governmental acknowledgment of a historic district. However, the Register is &#34;an honorary status with some federal financial incentives.&#34;<sup id="_ref-nps4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nps4" title="">[7]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places" id="w">National Register of Historic Places</a> defines a historic district per <a href="/wiki/National_Historic_Preservation_Act_of_1966" id="w">U.S. federal law</a>, last revised in 2004.<sup id="_ref-nrhp_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp" title="">[6]</a></sup> According to the Register definition a historic district is: </p><blockquote>&#34;a geographically definable area, urban or rural, possessing a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united by past events or aesthetically by plan or physical development. A district may also comprise individual elements separated geographically but linked by association or history.&#34;<sup id="_ref-nrhp_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp" title="">[6]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Districts established under U.S. federal guidelines generally begin the process of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of <a href="/wiki/Cultural_resources_management" id="w">cultural resources</a> worthy of preservation.<sup id="_ref-register_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-register" title="">[8]</a></sup> While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the <a href="/wiki/U.S._government" id="w">federal government</a>. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the <a href="/wiki/Property_types#Site" id="w">site</a>, property or district no protections.<sup id="_ref-nps_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nps" title="">[9]</a></sup> For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.<sup id="_ref-nps_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nps" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In general, the criteria for acceptance to the National Register are applied consistently, but there are considerations for exceptions to the criteria and historic districts have influence on some of those exceptions. Usually, the National Register does not list religious structures, moved structures, reconstructed structures, or properties that have achieved significance within the last 50 years. However, if a property falls into one of those categories and are &#34;<a href="/wiki/Contributing_property" id="w">integral parts</a> of districts that do meet the criteria&#34; then an exception allowing their listing will be made.<sup id="_ref-nrhp_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp" title="">[6]</a></sup> Historic district listings, like all National Register nominations, can be rejected on the basis of owner disapproval. In the case of historic districts, a majority of owners must object in order to nullify a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. If such an objection occurred, then the nomination would become a determination of National Register eligibility only.<sup id="_ref-nrhp_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

Most <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">U.S. state</a> governments have a listing similar to the National Register of Historic Places. State listings can have similar benefits to federal designation, such as granting qualification and tax incentives. In addition, the property can become protected under specific state laws.<sup id="_ref-nps_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nps" title="">[9]</a></sup> The laws can be similar or different from the federal guidelines that govern the National Register. A state listing of a historic district on a &#34;State Register of Historic Places,&#34; usually by the <a href="/wiki/State_Historic_Preservation_Office" id="w">State Historic Preservation Office</a>, can be an &#34;honorary status,&#34; much like the National Register. For example, in <a href="/wiki/Nevada" id="w">Nevada</a>, listing in the State Register places no limits on property owners.<sup id="_ref-review_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-review" title="">[10]</a></sup> In contrast, state law in <a href="/wiki/Tennessee" id="w">Tennessee</a> requires that property owners within historic districts follow a strict set of guidelines, from the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Interior" id="w">U.S. Department of Interior</a>, when altering their properties.<sup id="_ref-planning_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-planning" title="">[11]</a></sup> Though, according to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, all states must have a State Historic Preservation Office, not all states must have a &#34;state historic district&#34; designation.

Local historic districts usually enjoy the greatest level of protection, under law, from any threats that may compromise their historic integrity. This is due to the fact that many land-use decisions are made at the local level.<sup id="_ref-nps_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nps" title="">[9]</a></sup> There are more than 2,300 local historic districts in the United States.<sup id="_ref-nps2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nps2" title="">[13]</a></sup> Local historic districts can be administered at the <a href="/wiki/County_(United_States)" id="w">county</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Municipal" id="w">municipal</a> level; both entities are involved in land use decisions.<sup id="_ref-county_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-county" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the National Park Service, historic districts are one of the oldest forms of protection for historic properties. The city of <a href="/wiki/Charleston%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Charleston, South Carolina</a> is credited with beginning the modern day historic districts movement.<sup id="_ref-nps3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nps3" title="">[15]</a></sup> In 1931 Charleston enacted an <a href="/wiki/Local_ordinance" id="w">ordinance</a> which designated an &#34;Old and Historic District&#34; which was administered by a Board of Architectural Review.<sup id="_ref-nps3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nps3" title="">[15]</a></sup> Charleston&#39;s early ordinance reflected the strong protection that local historic districts often enjoy under local law. It asserted that no alteration could be made to any architectural features which could be viewed by the public from the street.<sup id="_ref-nps3_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nps3" title="">[15]</a></sup> Other local historic districts, such as that in <a href="/wiki/Savannah%2C_Georgia" id="w">Savannah, Georgia</a>, predate the Register by 10 years or more as well.<sup id="_ref-defender_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-defender" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Local historic districts are most likely to generate resistance because of the restrictions they tend to place on property owners.<sup id="_ref-nythu_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nythu" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-nyt06_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nyt06" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-fosters_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fosters" title="">[19]</a></sup> Local laws can cause residents to &#34;manage . .  . obligations to comply with (local historic district) ordinances.&#34;<sup id="_ref-yale_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-yale" title="">[20]</a></sup> Examples of  local preservation laws  can be found in <a href="/wiki/Nashville%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, where the city has adopted the stricter of two sets of criteria.<sup id="_ref-planning_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-planning" title="">[11]</a></sup> In Nashville, per state and local law, building design criteria for structures that are designated as parts of local &#34;preservation districts&#34; are derived from the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_Interior" id="w">Secretary of Interior</a>&#39;s Standards for the Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings. For property owners within these preservation districts to make alterations they must adhere to a set of guidelines which concern roof form and materials, front and side porches (no <a href="/wiki/Window_screen" id="w">screens</a> allowed), shape, style and placement of windows and doors, construction materials (no <a href="/wiki/Hardboard" id="w">hardboard</a>, <a href="/wiki/Masonite" id="w">masonite</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aluminum_siding" id="w">aluminum</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Vinyl_siding" id="w">vinyl</a> cladding allowed), lighting fixtures, fences, paving, and paint color (for <a href="/wiki/Masonry" id="w">masonry</a> structures).<sup id="_ref-planning_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-planning" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Resistance to historic district designations and expansions is fairly widespread. In <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>, in 2006, residents resisted the designation of historic district for <a href="/wiki/Fieldston%2C_Bronx" id="w">Fieldston</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Bronx" id="w">Bronx</a> neighborhood, because of the increase in regulations and decrease in <a href="/wiki/Property_value" id="w">property values</a> associated with historic districts.<sup id="_ref-nythu_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nythu" title="">[17]</a></sup> In April 2007 residents and politicians in <a href="/wiki/Rochester%2C_New_Hampshire" id="w">Rochester, New Hampshire</a> resisted a historic district boundary increase.

The original concept of an American historic district was as a protective area surrounding more important, individual historic sites. As the field of historic preservation progressed, those involved came to realize that the structures acting as &#34;buffer zones&#34; were actually key elements of the historic integrity of larger, <a href="/wiki/Landmark" id="w">landmark</a> sites. Preservationists came to the view that districts should be more encompassing, blending together a mesh of structures, streets, open space and landscaping to define the historical character of a historic district.<sup id="_ref-chronicle1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chronicle1" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>As early as 1981 the <a href="/wiki/National_Trust_for_Historic_Preservation" id="w">National Trust for Historic Preservation</a> identified 882 American cities and towns that had some form of &#34;historic district zoning&#34; in place; local laws meant specifically to protect historic districts. Before 1966, historic preservation in the United States was in its infancy. That year the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Conference_of_Mayors" id="w">U.S. Conference of Mayors</a> penned an influential report which concluded, in part, that Americans suffered from a sense of &#34;rootlessness.&#34;<sup id="_ref-datel_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-datel" title="">[1]</a></sup> They recommended <a href="/wiki/Historic_preservation" id="w">historic preservation</a> to help provide Americans with a sense of orientation.
