<p>The <a href="/wiki/Church_Fathers" id="w">Church Father</a> and Saint <b>Methodius of Olympus</b> (died ca. <a href="/wiki/311" id="w">311</a>) was a Christian <a href="/wiki/Bishop" id="w">bishop</a>, ecclesiastical author, and <a href="/wiki/Martyr" id="w">martyr</a>.</p>
<a id="Life" name="Life"></a><h2>Life</h2>
<p>Few reports have survived on the life of this first scientific opponent of <a href="/wiki/Origen" id="w">Origen</a>; even these short accounts present many difficulties. <a href="/wiki/Eusebius" id="w">Eusebius</a> does not mention him in his &#34;Church History&#34;, probably because he opposed various theories of Origen. We are indebted to <a href="/wiki/Jerome" id="w">Saint Jerome</a> for the earliest accounts of him (<a href="/wiki/Jerome%26%2339%3Bs_De_Viris_Illustribus" id="w">De viris illustribus, chapter 83</a>). According to him, Methodius was Bishop of <a href="/wiki/Olympus" id="w">Olympus</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lycia" id="w">Lycia</a> and afterwards Bishop of <a href="/wiki/Tyre_(Lebanon)" id="w">Tyre</a>. The latter statement is not reliable; no later Greek author knows anything of his being Bishop of Tyre; and according to Eusebius (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i>, VIII, xiii), Tyrannio was Bishop of Tyre during the persecutions of <a href="/wiki/Diocletian" id="w">Diocletian</a> and died a martyr; after the persecution Paulinus was elected bishop of the city. Jerome further states that Methodius suffered martyrdom at the end of the last persecution, i.e., under <a href="/wiki/Maximinus" id="w">Maximinus Daia</a> (311). Although he then adds, &#34;that some assert&#34;, that this may have happened under <a href="/wiki/Decius" id="w">Decius</a> and <a href="/wiki/Valerian_(emperor)" id="w">Valerian</a> at <a href="/wiki/Chalcis" id="w">Chalcis</a>, this statement (<i>ut alii affirmant</i>), adduced even by him as uncertain, is unlikely. Various attempts have been made to clear up the error concerning the mention of Tyre as a subsequent bishopric of Methodius; it is possible that he was transported to Tyre during the persecution and died there.</p>
<a id="Works" name="Works"></a><h2>Works</h2>
<p>Methodius had a comprehensive philosophical education, and was an important <a href="/wiki/Theology" id="w">theologian</a> as well as a prolific and polished author. Chronologically, his works can only be assigned in a general way to the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth century. He became of special importance in the history of theological literature, in that he combated various views of the great <a href="/wiki/Alexandria" id="w">Alexandrian</a>, Origen. He particularly attacked his doctrine that man&#39;s body at the <a href="/wiki/Resurrection" id="w">resurrection</a> is not the same body as he had in life, as well as his idea of the world&#39;s eternity. Nevertheless he recognized the great services of Origen in ecclesiastical theology. </p>
<p>Like Origen, he is strongly influenced by <a href="/wiki/Plato" id="w">Plato</a>&#39;s philosophy, and uses to a great extent the allegorical explanation of <a href="/wiki/Scripture" id="w">Scripture</a>. Of his numerous works only one has come down to us complete in a Greek text: the dialogue on virginity, under the title <i>Symposium, or on Virginity</i> (<i>Symposion he peri hagneias</i>) in P.G., XVIII, 27-220. In the dialogue, composed with reference to <a href="/wiki/Symposium_(Plato)" id="w">Plato&#39;s &#39;&#39;Symposium&#39;&#39;</a>, he depicts a festive meal of ten virgins in the garden of <a href="/wiki/Arete_(virtue)" id="w">Arete</a>, at which each of the participators extols Christian virginity and its sublime excellence. It concludes with a hymn on Jesus as the Bridegroom of the Church. Larger fragments are preserved of several other writings in Greek; we know of other works from old versions in <a href="/wiki/Slavonic_languages" id="w">Slavonic</a>, though some are abbreviated.</p>
<p>The following works are in the form of dialogue: 
</p>
<ol>
<li><i>On Free Will</i> (<i>peri tou autexousiou</i>), an important treatise attacking the <a href="/wiki/Gnosticism" id="w">Gnostic</a> view of the origin of evil and in proof of the freedom of the human will</li>
<li><i>On the Resurrection</i> (<i>Aglaophon he peri tes anastaseos</i>), in which the doctrine that the same body that man has in life will be awakened to incorruptibility at the resurrection is specially put forward in opposition to Origen. </li></ol>
<p>While large portions of the original Greek text of both these writings are preserved, we have only Slavonic versions of the four following shorter treatises: 
</p>
<ol>
<li><i>De vita</i>, on life and rational action, which exhorts in particular to contentedness in this life and to the hope of the life to come </li>
<li><i>De cibis</i>, on the <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jewish</a> <a href="/wiki/Kashrut" id="w">dietary laws</a>, and on the young cow, which is mentioned in <a href="/wiki/Leviticus" id="w">Leviticus</a>, with allegorical explanation of the Old Testament food-legislation and the red cow (<a href="/wiki/Book_of_Numbers" id="w">Num.</a>, xix)</li>
<li><i>De lepra</i>, on <a href="/wiki/Leprosy" id="w">leprosy</a>, to Sistelius, a dialogue between Eubulius (Methodius) and Sistelius on the mystic sense of the Old Testament references to lepers (Lev., xiii)</li>
<li><i>De sanguisuga</i>, on the <a href="/wiki/Leech" id="w">leech</a> in Proverbs (Prov., xxx, 15 sq.) and on the text, &#34;the heavens show forth the glory of God&#34; (Ps. xviii, 2). </li></ol>
<p>Of other writings, no longer extant, Jerome mentions (loc. cit.) a voluminous work against <a href="/wiki/Porphyry_(philosopher)" id="w">Porphyry</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Neoplatonism" id="w">Neoplatonist</a> who had published a book against Christianity; a treatise on the <i>Pythonissa</i> directed against Origen, commentaries on <a href="/wiki/Genesis" id="w">Genesis</a> and the Canticle of Canticles. Other authors attributed a work <i>On the Martyrs</i>, and a dialogue <i>Xenon</i> to Methodius; in the latter he opposes the doctrine of Origen on the eternity of the world. The 7th-century <a href="/wiki/Apocalypse_of_Pseudo-Methodius" id="w">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</a> is <a href="/wiki/Pseudepigraphy" id="w">falsely attributed</a> to him. His <a href="/wiki/Feast_day" id="w">feast day</a> is <a href="/wiki/September_18" id="w">September 18</a>. Among the editions of his works are: P.G., XVIII; <a href="/wiki/Jahn" id="w">Jahn</a>, <i>S. Methodii opera et S. Methodius platonizans</i> (Halle, 1865); <a href="/wiki/Bonwetsch" id="w">Bonwetsch</a>, <i>Methodius von Olympus: I, Schriften</i> (Leipzig, 1891).</p>
