<b>Ecclesiastical heraldry</b> is the tradition of <a href="/wiki/Heraldry" id="w">heraldry</a> developed by <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christian</a> <a href="/wiki/Clergy" id="w">clergy</a>. Initially used to mark documents, <a href="/wiki/Ecclesiology" id="w">ecclesiastical</a> heraldry evolved as a system for identifying people and <a href="/wiki/Diocese" id="w">dioceses</a>. It is most formalized within the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Church" id="w">Catholic Church</a>, where most <a href="/wiki/Bishop" id="w">bishops</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/Pope" id="w">Pope</a>, have a personal <a href="/wiki/Coat_of_arms" id="w">coat of arms</a>. Clergy in <a href="/wiki/Anglicanism" id="w">Anglican</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lutheranism" id="w">Lutheran</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Churches" id="w">Eastern Catholic</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Christianity" id="w">Orthodox churches</a> follow similar customs. Institutions such as schools and dioceses bear arms called impersonal or corporate arms.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastical heraldry differs notably from other heraldry in the use of special symbols around the <a href="/wiki/Escutcheon" id="w">shield</a> to indicate rank in a church or <a href="/wiki/Religious_denomination" id="w">denomination</a>. The most prominent of these symbols is the ecclesiastical hat, commonly the Roman <a href="/wiki/Galero" id="w">galero</a> or <a href="/wiki/Geneva_Bonnet" id="w">Geneva Bonnet</a>. The color and ornamentation of this hat carry a precise meaning. <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" id="w">Cardinals</a> are famous for the &#34;red hat&#34;, but other offices are assigned a distinctive hat color. The hat is ornamented with <a href="/wiki/Tassel" id="w">tassels</a> in a quantity commensurate with the office.</p>
<p>Other symbols include the <a href="/wiki/Christian_cross" id="w">cross</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mitre" id="w">mitre</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Crosier" id="w">crosier</a>. Eastern traditions favor the use of the <a href="/wiki/Mantle_(vesture)" id="w">mantle</a> or cloak rather than the galero. The <a href="/wiki/Motto" id="w">motto</a> and certain shapes of shields are more common in ecclesiastical heraldry, while <a href="/wiki/Supporters" id="w">supporters</a> and <a href="/wiki/Crest_(heraldry)" id="w">crests</a> are less common. The <a href="/wiki/Papal_coat_of_arms" id="w">papal coat of arms</a> has its own heraldic customs, primarily the <a href="/wiki/Papal_Tiara" id="w">Papal Tiara</a> (or mitre), the keys of <a href="/wiki/Saint_Peter" id="w">Saint Peter</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Ombrellino" id="w">ombrellino</a> (umbrella). Institutional arms have slightly different traditions, using the mitre and crozier more often than personal arms.</p>

<a href="/wiki/Heraldry" id="w">Heraldry</a> developed in <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">medieval Europe</a> from the late 11th century, originally as a system of personal badges of the warrior classes, which served, among other purposes, as identification on the battlefield. The same insignia were used on <a href="/wiki/Seal_(device)" id="w">seals</a> to identify documents. The earliest seals bore a likeness of the owner of the seal, with the shield and heraldic insignia included.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Over time, the seals of the <a href="/wiki/Nobility" id="w">nobility</a> were reduced to just the shield.</p>
<p>The Church likewise identified the origin and ownership of documents and buildings with seals, which were typically oval in shape to distinguish from secular round seals.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Synods_of_Westminster" id="w">Synod of London</a> required seals for all religious authorities in 1237, and <a href="/wiki/Edward_I_of_England" id="w">Edward I of England</a> decreed in 1307 that no document would be valid without one.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Personal seals of bishops and <a href="/wiki/Abbot" id="w">abbots</a> continued to be used after their deaths, gradually becoming an impersonal seal.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> These seals initially depicted a person, but as secular seals began to depict only a shield, clergy followed this development by adopting seals with heraldic insignia.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> As non-combatants, the clergy tended to replace military elements with clerical elements. The shield was retained, but ecclesiastical hats often replaced helmets and <a href="/wiki/Coronet" id="w">coronets</a>.</p>
<p>There was no structured Church heraldry until the 17th century, when a system for ecclesiastical hats attributed to Pierre Palliot came into use.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> The full system of emblems around the shield was regulated in the Catholic Church by the letter of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_X" id="w">Pope Pius X</a> <i>Inter multiplices curas</i> of <a href="/wiki/February_21" id="w">February 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1905" id="w">1905</a>. The composition of the shield itself was regulated and registered with the Heraldry Commission of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Curia" id="w">Roman Curia</a>, but since this office was abolished by <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_XXIII" id="w">Pope John XXIII</a> in 1960, shield design has had no official guidance.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> The Collegio Araldico (College of Heraldry) in <a href="/wiki/Rome" id="w">Rome</a> is recognized by the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See" id="w">Holy See</a> but has no enforcement powers, and the <i><a href="/wiki/Annuario_Pontificio" id="w">Annuario Pontificio</a></i> ceased publishing the arms of Cardinals and previous Popes after 1969.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> International custom and national law govern limited aspects of heraldry, but since 1960, shield composition has depended on expert advice. Archbishop <a href="/wiki/Bruno_Heim" id="w">Bruno Heim</a>, a noted ecclesiastical <a href="/wiki/Armory_(heraldry)" id="w">armorist</a> (designer of arms), said</p>
<dl><dd>&#34;Ecclesiastical heraldry is not determined by heraldic considerations alone, but also by <a href="/wiki/Doctrine" id="w">doctrinal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Liturgy" id="w">liturgical</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canon_law" id="w">canonical</a> factors. It not only produces arms denoting members of the ecclesiastical state but shows the rank of the bearer.... In the eyes of the Church it is sufficient to determine who has a right to bear an ecclesiastical coat of arms and under what conditions the different insignia are acquired or lost... The design of <a href="/wiki/Prelate" id="w">prelatial</a> arms is often a disastrous defiance of the rules of heraldry, if only as a breach of good taste.&#34;<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>A similar system in the <a href="/wiki/Anglican_Communion" id="w">Anglican Communion</a> was approved in 1976.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The traditions of <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Christianity" id="w">Eastern Christian</a> heraldry have less developed regulation. Eastern secular coats of arms often display a shield before a mantle topped with a crown. Eastern clergy often display coats of arms according to this style, replacing the crown with an appropriate hat drawn from the liturgy.</p>
<p>Marking documents is the most common use of arms in the Church today. A Catholic bishop&#39;s coat of arms was formerly painted on miniature wine barrels and presented during the ordination ceremony.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Cardinals may place their coat of arms outside the church of their title in Rome.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Impersonal arms are often used as the banner of a school or religious community.</p>

The <a href="/wiki/Escutcheon" id="w">shield</a> is the normal device for displaying a coat of arms. Clergy have used less-military shapes such as the oval <a href="/wiki/Cartouche" id="w">cartouche</a>, but the shield has always been a clerical option. Clergy in <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a> often use a shield shaped like a horse&#39;s face-armor.

<a id="Personal_design" name="Personal_design"></a><h2>Personal design</h2>
<p>Unless a new bishop has a family coat of arms, he typically adopts within his shield symbols that indicate his interests or past service. Devotion to a particular <a href="/wiki/Saint" id="w">saint</a> is represented by symbols established in <a href="/wiki/Iconography" id="w">iconography</a> and heraldic tradition.</p>
<p>The first rule of heraldry is the <a href="/wiki/Rule_of_tincture" id="w">rule of tincture</a>, which says &#34;colour must not appear upon colour, nor metal upon metal.&#34;<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The heraldic metals are <a href="/wiki/Or_(heraldry)" id="w">gold</a> and <a href="/wiki/Argent" id="w">silver</a>, usually represented as yellow and white, while red, green, blue, purple and black normally comprise the colors. Heraldic insignia are intended for recognition at a distance (in battle), and a contrast of light metal against dark color is desirable. The same principle can be seen in the choice of colors for most <a href="/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plate" id="w">license plates</a>.</p>
<p>This rule of tincture is often broken in clerical arms; the flag and arms of <a href="/wiki/Vatican_City" id="w">Vatican City</a> notably have yellow and white placed together. In <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Rite" id="w">Byzantine</a> tradition, colors have a mystical interpretation. Since gold and silver express sublimity and solemnity, combinations of the two are often used regardless of the rule of tincture.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

If a bishop is a diocesan bishop, it is customary for him to combine his arms with the arms of the diocese following normal heraldic rules.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> This combining is termed <a href="/wiki/Heraldry#Marshalling" id="w">marshalling</a>, and is normally accomplished by <a href="/wiki/Impalement_(heraldry)" id="w">impalement</a>, placing the arms of the diocese to the viewer&#39;s left (<i>dexter</i> in heraldry) and the personal arms to the viewer&#39;s right. The arms of <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Arundel" id="w">Thomas Arundel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury" id="w">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, are found impaled with those of the See in a document from 1411.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> and <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quartering_(heraldry)" id="w">quartering</a> is the norm rather than impalement. <a href="/wiki/Guy_Selvester" id="w">Guy Selvester</a>, an American ecclesiastical heraldist, says if arms are not designed with care, marshalling can lead to &#34;busy&#34;, crowded shields. This can be avoided by placing a smaller shield overlapping the larger shield, known as an <a href="/wiki/Inescutcheon" id="w">inescutcheon</a> or escutcheon of pretense. In the arms of <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Mussinghoff" id="w">Heinrich Mussinghoff</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Aachen" id="w">Bishop of Aachen</a>, the personal arms are placed in front of the diocesan arms, but the opposite arrangement is found in front on the arms of <a href="/wiki/Paul_Gregory_Bootkoski" id="w">Paul Gregory Bootkoski</a>, Bishop of <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Metuchen" id="w">Metuchen</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" id="w">Cardinals</a> sometimes combine their personal arms with the arms of the Pope who named them a cardinal.

<p><a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Great_Britain" id="w">Catholic bishops in England</a> use only their personal arms, as dioceses established by the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See" id="w">See of Rome</a> are not part of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" id="w">state-established Church</a> and cannot be recognized in law.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> If a <a href="/wiki/Suffragan_bishop" id="w">suffragan</a> or <a href="/wiki/Auxiliary_bishop" id="w">auxiliary bishop</a> has a personal coat of arms, he does not combine it with the arms of the diocese he serves.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Ecclesiastical_hat" name="Ecclesiastical_hat"></a><h2>Ecclesiastical hat</h2>
<p>The hat called a galero (or gallero) is a distinctive part of the achievement of a Roman Catholic cleric. The galero was originally a pilgrim&#39;s-style hat like a sombrero, granted in red to cardinals by <a href="/wiki/Pope_Innocent_IV" id="w">Pope Innocent IV</a> at the <a href="/wiki/First_Council_of_Lyon" id="w">First Council of Lyon</a> in the 13th century, and was adopted by heraldry almost immediately. The galero in various colors and forms was used in heraldic achievements starting with its adoption in the arms of bishops in the 16th century. By the 19th century it was viewed as specifically &#34;Catholic&#34;.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> The galero is ornamented with tassels (also termed <i>houppes</i> or <i>fiocchi</i>) indicating the cleric&#39;s place in the hierarchy; the number became significant beginning in the 16th century, and the meaning was fixed in 1832.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> A bishop&#39;s heraldic galero is green with six tassels on each side; the color originated in <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Spain" id="w">Spain</a> where formerly the green hat was actually worn by bishops.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> A <a href="/wiki/Territorial_abbot" id="w">territorial abbot</a> is equivalent to a bishop and uses a green galero. An <a href="/wiki/Archbishop" id="w">archbishop</a>&#39;s galero is green but has ten tassels. <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Switzerland" id="w">Bishops in Switzerland</a> formerly used ten tassels like an archbishop because they were under the immediate jurisdiction of the Holy See and not part of an archiepiscopal <a href="/wiki/Ecclesiastical_province" id="w">province</a>.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Both <a href="/wiki/Patriarch" id="w">patriarchs</a> and cardinals have a galero with fifteen tassels, but a patriarch&#39;s galero is green while a cardinal&#39;s is red or scarlet. The patriarch&#39;s tassels are interwoven with gold.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Primate_(religion)" id="w">Primates</a> may use the same external ornaments as patriarchs.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>The depiction of the galero in arms can vary greatly depending on the artist&#39;s style. Typically the top of the hat is flat and the brim is wide. However, the brim can be rendered much narrower, and the top can be domed. Such variants look like a <a href="/wiki/Cappello_romano" id="w">cappello romano</a> with tassels, but in heraldry it is still considered a galero. The tassels may be represented simply as knotted cords.

<a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_China" id="w">Chinese bishops</a> often avoid using green galero in their arms since &#34;wearing a green hat&#34; is the Chinese idiom for <a href="/wiki/Cuckold" id="w">cuckold</a>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Rather than green, these bishops use a variety of colors from violet and black to blue, or scarlet if a cardinal.</p>
<p>Lesser prelates use other colors. The <a href="/wiki/Superior_general" id="w">superior general</a> of an order displays a black galero with six tassels on each side, while provincial superiors and abbots use a black galero with six or three tassels on each side, although <a href="/wiki/Premonstratensian" id="w">Norbertines</a> (White Canons) use a white galero.

The lowest grade of monsignor, a Chaplain of His Holiness, uses a black hat with violet tassels.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Although a <a href="/wiki/Priesthood_(Catholic_Church)" id="w">priest</a> would rarely assume arms unless he had an ancestral right to arms independent of his clerical state, a priest would use a simple black galero with a single tassel on each side. Priests who hold an office such as <a href="/wiki/Rector" id="w">rector</a> would have two tassels on each side.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Cross" name="Cross"></a><h2>Cross</h2>
<p>The display of a cross behind the shield is restricted to bishops as a mark of their dignity.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> The cross of an ordinary bishop has a single horizontal bar or traverse, also known as a <a href="/wiki/Christian_cross#Forms of the Cross" id="w">Latin cross</a>. A <a href="/wiki/Patriarch" id="w">patriarch</a> uses the <a href="/wiki/Patriarchal_cross" id="w">patriarchal cross</a> with two traverses, also called the <a href="/wiki/Cross_of_Lorraine" id="w">cross of Lorraine</a>. The papal cross has three traverses, but this is never displayed behind the papal arms.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 15th century, the cross with a double traverse is seen on the arms of archbishops, and relates to their processional cross and the jurisdiction it symbolizes.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Except for cardinals of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Curia" id="w">Roman Curia</a>, most cardinals head an archdiocese and use an archiepiscopal cross on their arms. Other cardinals use a simple Latin cross,<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> as is found in the arms of Cardinal <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Zen" id="w">Joseph Zen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Diocese_of_Hong_Kong" id="w">bishop of Hong Kong</a>, because Hong Kong is not an archdiocese.</p>
<p>Today all cardinals are required to be bishops, but priests named cardinal at an advanced age often petition the Pope for an exception to this rule. Since the cross is one heraldic emblem that only bishops have the right to bear, cardinals who are not consecrated bishops do not use it.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> Notable examples are Cardinals <a href="/wiki/Albert_Vanhoye" id="w">Albert Vanhoye</a> and <a href="/wiki/Avery_Dulles" id="w">Avery Dulles</a>, although curiously the latter&#39;s arms do display a cross.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>

The <a href="/wiki/Mitre" id="w">mitre</a> was placed above the shield of all persons who were entitled to wear the mitre, including abbots.

In the Roman Catholic Church, the use of the mitre above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969,<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> and is now found only on some corporate arms.

The <a href="/wiki/Crosier" id="w">crosier</a> was displayed as a symbol of pastoral jurisdiction by bishops, abbots, abbesses, and cardinals even if they were not bishops. The crosier of a bishop is turned outward or to the right. Frequently the crosier of an abbot or abbess is turned inward, either toward the mitre or to the left, but this distinction is disputed and is not an absolute rule.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VII" id="w">Pope Alexander VII</a> decreed in 1659 that the crosiers of abbots include a <i>sudarium</i> or veil, but this is not customary in English heraldry.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> The veil may have arisen because abbots, unlike bishops, did not wear gloves when carrying an actual crosier.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> Because the cross has similar symbolism,<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> the crosier was suppressed for cardinals and bishops by the Catholic Church in 1969, and is now used only on some corporate arms, and the personal arms of abbots and some abbesses.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> In English custom and in the Anglican Church, two crosiers are often found crossed <i>in saltire</i> behind the shield.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> In the Lutheran <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Sweden" id="w">Church of Sweden</a>, the crosier is displayed in the arms of bishops in office but is removed when a bishop retires.</p>

<a href="/wiki/Mantling" id="w">Mantling</a> was originally a piece of material attached to a helmet and covering the shoulders, possibly to protect from the sun. In secular heraldry the mantling was depicted shredded, as if from battle. In the 17th and 18th centuries, another form of mantling called a &#34;robe of estate&#34; became prominent.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> This form is used especially in the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" id="w">Orthodox Churches</a>, where bishops display a mantle tied with cords and tassels above the shield. The heraldic mantle is similar to the <a href="/wiki/Mantle_(vesture)" id="w">mantiya</a>, and represents the bishop&#39;s authority. It can also be found in the arms of the Grand Master of the <a href="/wiki/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta" id="w">Sovereign Military Order of Malta</a>.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>The outside of the mantle may be any color, typically red, while the inside is white or sometimes yellow to distinguish it from a secular mantle.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> David Johnson has suggested that the mantle of all bishops should be white inside, excepting only patriarchs who use <a href="/wiki/Ermine_(heraldry)" id="w">ermine</a>, to indicate that all bishops are equally bishops and to emphasize the <a href="/wiki/Synod" id="w">consular</a> nature of Orthodoxy.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> Above the mantle is a mitre (of the Eastern style) between a processional cross and a crosier. The earliest examples of the arms of Orthodox hierarchs have the cross to the dexter of the mitre and the bishop&#39;s staff to sinister, but opposite examples exist. An abbot (<a href="/wiki/Archimandrite" id="w">archimandrite</a> or <a href="/wiki/Hegumen" id="w">hegumen</a>) should display a veiled abbot&#39;s staff to distinguish it from the bishop&#39;s staff.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Archpriest" id="w">Archpriests</a> and priests would use a less ornate mantle in their arms, and an ecclesiastical hat of the style they wear liturgically. While an <a href="/wiki/Monk#Eastern Orthodox monks" id="w">Orthodox monk</a> (not an abbot) displaying personal arms is rare, a <a href="/wiki/Hieromonk" id="w">hieromonk</a> would appropriately display a monastic hat and a cloak or veil suggestive of his attire, and a heirodeacon would display an <a href="/wiki/Orarion" id="w">orarion</a> behind the shield.</p>
<p>A shield in front of a mantle or cloak may be found among bishops of the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Churches" id="w">Eastern Catholic Churches</a>.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> However, some Eastern ecclesiastical variations omit the mantle but retain the mitre, cross and staff.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Maronite_Church" id="w">Maronite</a> bishops traditionally display a pastoral staff behind the shield, topped with a globe and cross or a cross within a globe.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> Eastern Catholic bishops may follow the Roman style with a galero, although the shield itself is often rendered in a Byzantine artistic style, and a mitre if present would be in the appropriate liturgical style.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Motto" name="Motto"></a><h2>Motto</h2>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Motto" id="w">motto</a> is a short phrase usually appearing below the shield as a statement of belief. Catholic bishops and Presbyterian churches use a motto in their arms,<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> though it is rare among Anglican bishops.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> A notable exception is the motto on the coat of arms of <a href="/wiki/Rowan_Williams" id="w">Rowan Williams</a>, <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury" id="w">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Gustavo_Testa" id="w">Gustavo Testa</a>, designated cardinal in December 1959, quickly selected as his arms a shield with the words <i>sola gratia tua</i> and the motto <i>et patria et cor</i> in order to meet a publishing deadline.

<a href="/wiki/Saint_Peter" id="w">Saint Peter</a> was represented holding keys as early as the fifth century.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Papal_Tiara" id="w">Papal Tiara</a> or <i>triregnum</i> is the three-tiered crown used by the Pope as a sovereign power.
