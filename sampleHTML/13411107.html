<p>The <b>2007 United States Air Force nuclear weapons incident</b> occurred at <a href="/wiki/Minot_Air_Force_Base" id="w">Minot Air Force Base</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barksdale_Air_Force_Base" id="w">Barksdale Air Force Base</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>. Six <a href="/wiki/AGM-129_ACM" id="w">AGM-129 ACM</a> <a href="/wiki/Cruise_missile" id="w">cruise missiles</a>, each armed with a <a href="/wiki/W80" id="w">W80-1</a> <a href="/wiki/Variable_yield" id="w">variable yield</a> <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_warhead" id="w">nuclear warhead</a>, were mistakenly loaded on a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" id="w">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) <a href="/wiki/B-52H" id="w">B-52H</a> <a href="/wiki/Heavy_bomber" id="w">heavy bomber</a> at Minot and transported to Barksdale.  The nuclear warheads in the missiles were supposed to have been removed before taking the missiles from their storage bunker.  The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for a period of 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions required for nuclear weapons.  The incident was reported to the top levels of the United States (U.S.) military as a <a href="/wiki/United_States_military_nuclear_incident_terminology#Bent Spear" id="w">Bent Spear</a> incident, which indicates a nuclear weapon incident that is of significant concern, but does not involve the immediate threat of nuclear war.</p>
<p>In response to the incident, the U.S. <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" id="w">Department of Defense</a> (DoD) and USAF conducted an investigation, the results of which were released on <a href="/wiki/October_19" id="w">October 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.  The investigation concluded that nuclear weapons handling standards and procedures had not been followed by numerous USAF personnel involved in the incident.  As a result, four USAF commanders were relieved of their commands, numerous other USAF personnel were disciplined and/or decertified to perform certain types of sensitive duties, and further cruise missile transport missions from Minot Air Force Base were suspended.</p>
<p>Several more reviews of nuclear procedures within the USAF are, as of November 2007, ongoing.  In addition, the USAF stated that further disciplinary action in relation to the incident may yet occur.</p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h2>Background</h2>
<p>Minot Air Force Base is the home of the <a href="/wiki/5th_Bomb_Wing" id="w">5th Bomb Wing</a> and Barksdale Air Force Base the home of <a href="/wiki/2nd_Bomb_Wing" id="w">2nd Bomb Wing</a>, both of which fall under the <a href="/wiki/Eighth_Air_Force" id="w">8th Air Force</a>, also based at Barksdale.  The 8th is part of <a href="/wiki/Air_Combat_Command" id="w">Air Combat Command</a> (ACC) in the USAF.  In August 2007 the 5th Bomb Wing was commanded by <a href="/wiki/Colonel" id="w">Colonel</a> Bruce Emig, the 2nd Bomb Wing by Colonel Robert Wheeler, the 8th Air Force by <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_General" id="w">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_J._Elder%2C_Jr." id="w">Robert Elder Jr.</a>, and ACC by <a href="/wiki/General_(United_States)" id="w">General</a> <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Keys" id="w">Ronald Keys</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The 5th Bomb Wing, according to the USAF&#39;s statement on the wing&#39;s mission, serves with its B-52 bombers as part of the USAF&#39;s conventional and strategic combat force.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  The &#34;strategic&#34; portion of the 5th&#39;s mission includes the ability to deliver nuclear weapons against potential targets worldwide.  Thus, Minot Air Force Base stores and maintains a ready arsenal of nuclear bombs, nuclear warheads, and associated delivery systems, including, as of August 2007, the AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missile.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">An AGM-129 cruise missile in flight.</div> AGM-129 was fielded in 1987 as a stealthy cruise missile platform to deliver the W80-3 variable yield nuclear warhead.  Although originally designed to equip the <a href="/wiki/B-1_Lancer" id="w">B-1 bomber</a>, it was later decided that the AGM-129 would only be carried by the B-52, mounted on external pylons on the wings.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In March 2007, the USAF decided to retire its AGM-129 complement in order to help comply with international arms-control treaties and to replace them with <a href="/wiki/AGM-86_ALCM" id="w">AGM-86</a> missiles.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  In order to do so, the USAF began to transport its AGM-129s stored at Minot by B-52s to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana for ultimate disposal.  By <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> according to the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Post" id="w">Washington Post</a>, more than 200 AGM-129s had been shipped from Minot to Barksdale in this manner.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Incident" name="Incident"></a><h2>Incident</h2>
<p>Between <a href="/wiki/24_hour_clock" id="w">08:00</a> and 09:00 on <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> a group of USAF <a href="/wiki/Airman" id="w">airmen</a> entered one of the weapons storage bunkers at Minot to prepare AGM-129 missiles for transport to Barksdale.  That day&#39;s missile transport, the sixth of 12 scheduled ferry missions, was to have consisted of 12 AGM-129s, installed with training warheads, with six missiles per <a href="/wiki/Pylon" id="w">pylon</a> and one pylon mounted under each wing of a Barksdale-assigned B-52 aircraft.  When the airmen entered the bunker, the missiles were already installed on the underwing pylons and the nuclear warheads in the missiles were supposed to have been already replaced with the dummy training warheads.  In this case, however, six of the missiles still carried nuclear warheads.  A later investigation found that the reason for the error was that the formal electronic scheduling system for tracking the missiles &#34;had been subverted in favor of an informal process that did not identify this pylon as prepared for the flight.&#34;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>  The airmen assigned to handle the missiles used an outdated paper schedule that contained incorrect information on the status of the missiles.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">An AGM-129 pylon is loaded onto the wing of a B-52 at Minot.</div> the airmen in the weapons storage began to inspect the missiles, an early-arriving transport crew hooked-up the pylons and towed them away without inspecting or ensuring that the missiles had been inspected or cleared for removal.  The munitions control center failed to verify that the pylon had received proper clearance and inspection and approved the pylon for loading on the B-52 aircraft at 09:25.  The munitions loading crew at the aircraft then failed to inspect the missiles to ensure that they all contained dummy warheads, done by looking through a small glass porthole on the missiles, before loading them on the aircraft.  After taking eight hours to attach the pylons to the aircraft, the aircraft with the missiles loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without special guard as required for nuclear weapons.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the morning of <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a>, one of the transport aircraft&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Flight_officer" id="w">flight officers</a>, a Barksdale-assigned B-52 instructor radar navigator (name unknown), only closely inspected the six missiles on the right wing, which were all properly uploaded with training warheads, before signing the manifest listing the cargo as a dozen unarmed AGM-129 missiles.  The B-52 command pilot did not do a final verification check before preparing to depart Minot.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The B-52 departed Minot at 08:40 and landed at Barksdale at 11:23 on <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a>.  The aircraft remained parked and without special guard until <a href="/wiki/24_hour_clock" id="w">20:30</a>, when a munitions team arrived to remove the missiles.  After a member of the munitions crew noticed something unusual about some of the missiles, at 22:00 a &#34;skeptical&#34; supervisor finally determined that nuclear warheads were present and ordered them secured and the incident reported, 36 hours after the missiles were removed from the bunker at Minot.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Response_by_the_U.S._government" name="Response_by_the_U.S._government"></a><h2> Response by the U.S. government </h2>
<p>The USAF and DoD at first decided to conceal the incident, in part because of the USAF policy not to comment on the storage or movement of nuclear weapons and an apparent belief that the incident wouldn&#39;t generate much public concern.  In fact, the DoD Broken Spear incident report reportedly contained the passage, &#34;No press interest anticipated.&#34;  Details of the incident, however, were leaked by unknown DoD officials to the <a href="/wiki/Army_Times_Publishing_Company" id="w">Military Times</a> newspaper, which published a small article on the incident on <a href="/wiki/September_5" id="w">September 5</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

The USAF announced that within days of the incident, the USAF relieved the Minot <a href="/wiki/AMMO_(U.S._Air_Force)" id="w">munitions squadron</a> commander and disciplined several airmen.  USAF <a href="/wiki/Major_General" id="w">Major General</a> Doug Raaberg was assigned by General Keys to lead an investigation into the incident.  Also, the USAF inventory of nuclear warheads was checked to ensure that all warheads were accounted for.  In addition, the DoD announced that a Pentagon-appointed scientific advisory panel would study the mishap as part of a larger review of procedures for handling nuclear weapons.  Furthermore, on <a href="/wiki/September_28" id="w">September 28</a>, the USAF announced that General Keys was retiring and would be replaced as ACC commander by General <a href="/wiki/John_D._W._Corley" id="w">John Corley</a>, effective <a href="/wiki/October_2" id="w">October 2</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
