<p><b>Patrick Lafcadio Hearn </b> (<a href="/wiki/June_27" id="w">June 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1850" id="w">1850</a> - <a href="/wiki/September_26" id="w">September 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1904" id="w">1904</a>), also known as <b>Koizumi Yakumo</b> (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/小">小</a><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/泉">泉</a><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/八">八</a><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/雲">雲</a>) after gaining Japanese citizenship, was an author, best known for his books about <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>. He is especially well-known for his collections of Japanese <a href="/wiki/Legend" id="w">legends</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kwaidan" id="w">ghost stories</a>, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Kwaidan:_Stories_and_Studies_of_Strange_Things" id="w">Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things</a></i>.</p>

<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h3>Early life</h3>
<p>Hearn was born in <a href="/wiki/Lefkada" id="w">Lefkada</a> (the origin of his middle name), one of the <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greek</a> <a href="/wiki/Ionian_Islands" id="w">Ionian Islands</a>. He was the son of Surgeon-major Charles Hearn (of <a href="/wiki/County_Offaly" id="w">King&#39;s County</a>, Ireland) and Rosa Antonia Kassimati <sup id="_ref-hearnparents_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hearnparents" title="">[1]</a></sup>, who had been born on <a href="/wiki/Kythera" id="w">Kythera</a>, another of the Ionian Islands. His father was stationed in Lefkada during the British occupation of the islands. Lafcadio was initially baptized <b><i>Patricio Lefcadio Tessima Carlos Hearn</i></b> in the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Greece" id="w">Greek Orthodox Church</a>.</p>
<p>Hearn moved to <a href="/wiki/Dublin" id="w">Dublin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a>, at the age of two. Artistic and rather <a href="/wiki/Bohemianism" id="w">bohemian</a> tastes were in his blood. His father&#39;s brother Richard was at one time a well-known member of the <a href="/wiki/Barbizon" id="w">Barbizon</a> set of artists, though he made no mark as a painter due to his lack of energy. Young Hearn had a rather casual education, but in 1865 was at <a href="/wiki/Ushaw_Roman_Catholic_College" id="w">Ushaw Roman Catholic College</a>, <a href="/wiki/Durham" id="w">Durham</a>. He was injured in a playground accident in his teens, causing loss of vision in his left eye.</p>
<a id="Emigration" name="Emigration"></a><h3>Emigration</h3>
<p>The religious faith in which he was brought up was, however, soon lost, and at 19 he was sent to live in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States of America</a>, where he settled in <a href="/wiki/Cincinnati%2C_Ohio" id="w">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>. For a time, he lived in utter poverty, which may have contributed to his later <a href="/wiki/Paranoia" id="w">paranoia</a> and distrust of those around him. He eventually found a friend in the English printer and communalist <a href="/wiki/Henry_Watkin" id="w">Henry Watkin</a>. With Watkin&#39;s help, Hearn picked up a living in the lower grades of newspaper work.</p>
<p>Through the strength of his talent as a writer, Hearn quickly advanced through the newspaper ranks and became a reporter for the <i><a href="/wiki/Cincinnati_Enquirer" id="w">Cincinnati Daily Enquirer</a></i>, working for the paper from <a href="/wiki/1872" id="w">1872</a> to <a href="/wiki/1875" id="w">1875</a>. With creative freedom in one of Cincinnati&#39;s largest circulating newspapers, he developed a reputation as the paper&#39;s premier sensational journalist, as well as the author of sensitive, dark, and fascinating accounts of Cincinnati&#39;s disadvantaged. He continued to occupy himself with journalism and with out-of-the-way observation and reading, and meanwhile his erratic, romantic, and rather morbid idiosyncrasies developed.</p>
<p>While in Cincinnati, he married Alethea (&#34;Mattie&#34;) Foley, a <a href="/wiki/African-American" id="w">black</a> woman, an illegal act at the time. When the scandal was discovered and publicized, he was fired from the <i>Enquirer</i> and went to work for the rival <i>Cincinnati Commercial</i>. </p>
<p>In 1874 Hearn and the young <a href="/wiki/Henry_Farny" id="w">Henry Farny</a>, later a renowned painter of the American West, wrote, illustrated, and published a weekly journal of art, literature, and satire they titled <i>Ye Giglampz</i> that ran for nine issues. The Cincinnati Public Library reprinted a facsimile of all nine issues in 1983.</p>

<a id="New_Orleans" name="New_Orleans"></a><h3>New Orleans</h3>
<p>In the autumn of 1877, Hearn left Cincinnati for <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana" id="w">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>, where he initially wrote dispatches on his discoveries in the &#34;Gateway to the Tropics&#34; for the <i>Cincinnati Commercial</i>. He lived in New Orleans for nearly a decade, writing first for the <i>Daily City Item</i> and later for the <i>Times Democrat</i>. The vast number of his writings about New Orleans and its environs, many of which have not been collected, include the city&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_Creole_people" id="w">Creole</a> population and distinctive cuisine, the French Opera, and <a href="/wiki/Vodou" id="w">Vodou</a>. His writings for national publications, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Harper%26%2339%3Bs_Weekly" id="w">Harper&#39;s Weekly</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Scribner%26%2339%3Bs_Magazine" id="w">Scribner&#39;s Magazine</a></i>, helped mold the popular image of New Orleans as a colorful place with a distinct culture more akin to Europe and the Caribbean than to the rest of North America. His best-known <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a> works are <i><a href="/wiki/Gombo_Zh%C3%A8bes" id="w">Gombo Zhèbes</a>, Little Dictionary of Creole Proverbs in Six Dialects</i> (<a href="/wiki/1885" id="w">1885</a>); <i>La Cuisine Créole</i> (1885), a collection of culinary recipes from leading chefs and noted Creole housewives who helped make New Orleans famous for its cuisine; and <i>Chita: A Memory of Last Island</i>, a novella based on the <a href="/wiki/1856_Last_Island_Hurricane" id="w">hurricane of 1856</a> first published in <i>Harper&#39;s Monthly</i> in 1888. Little known then, even today he is relatively unknown in New Orleans culture. However, more books have been written about him than any other former resident of New Orleans other than <a href="/wiki/Louis_Armstrong" id="w">Louis Armstrong</a>. His footprint in the history of Creole cooking is visible even today. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Harper&#39;s</i> sent Hearn to the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" id="w">West Indies</a> as a correspondent in <a href="/wiki/1889" id="w">1889</a>. He spent two years in the islands and produced <i>Two Years in the French West Indies</i> and <i>Youma, The Story of a West-Indian Slave</i> (both <a href="/wiki/1890" id="w">1890</a>).</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/1890" id="w">1890</a>, Hearn went to Japan with a commission as a newspaper correspondent, which was quickly broken off. It was in Japan, however, that he found his home and his greatest inspiration. Through the goodwill of <a href="/wiki/Basil_Hall_Chamberlain" id="w">Basil Hall Chamberlain</a>, Hearn gained a teaching position in the summer of 1890 at the Shimane Prefectural Common Middle School and Normal School in <a href="/wiki/Matsue%2C_Shimane" id="w">Matsue</a>, a town in western Japan on the coast of the Sea of Japan. Most Japanese identify Hearn with Matsue, as it was here that his image of Japan was molded. Today, <a href="/wiki/The_Lafcadio_Hearn_Memorial_Museum" id="w">The Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum</a> (小泉八雲記念館) and <a href="/wiki/Lafcadio_Hearn%26%2339%3Bs_Old_Residence" id="w">Lafcadio Hearn&#39;s Old Residence</a> (小泉八雲旧居) are still two of Matsue&#39;s most popular tourist attractions. During his 15-month stay in Matsue, Hearn married Setsu Koizumi, the daughter of a local samurai family, and became a naturalized Japanese, taking the name Koizumi Yakumo.</p>
<p>In late 1891, Hearn took another teaching position in <a href="/wiki/Kumamoto" id="w">Kumamoto</a>, Kyushu, at the Fifth Higher Middle School, where he spent the next three years and completed his book <i>Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan</i> (1894). In October 1894 he secured a journalism position with the English-language <i>Kobe Chronicle</i>, and in 1896, with some assistance from Chamberlain, he began teaching English literature at <a href="/wiki/University_of_Tokyo" id="w">Tokyo (Imperial) University</a>, a post he held until 1903. On <a href="/wiki/September_26" id="w">September 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1904" id="w">1904</a>, he died of heart failure at the age of 54.</p>
<p>In the late <a href="/wiki/19th_century" id="w">19th century</a> Japan was still largely unknown and exotic to the Western world. With the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> aesthetics, however, particularly at the <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> <a href="/wiki/World%26%2339%3Bs_Fair" id="w">World&#39;s Fair</a> in <a href="/wiki/1900" id="w">1900</a>, the West had an insatiable appetite for exotic Japan, and Hearn became known to the world through the depth, originality, sincerity, and charm of his writings. In later years, some critics would accuse Hearn of <a href="/wiki/Exoticism" id="w">exoticizing</a> Japan, but as the man who offered the West some of its first glimpses into pre-industrial and <a href="/wiki/Meiji_Era" id="w">Meiji Era</a> Japan, his work still offers valuable insight today.</p>
<a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>The Japanese director <a href="/wiki/Masaki_Kobayashi" id="w">Masaki Kobayashi</a> adapted four Hearn tales into his <a href="/wiki/1965" id="w">1965</a> <a href="/wiki/Film" id="w">film</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Kwaidan_(film)" id="w">Kwaidan</a></i>. </p>
<p>Several Hearn stories have been adapted by <a href="/wiki/Ping_Chong" id="w">Ping Chong</a> into his trademark <a href="/wiki/Puppet" id="w">puppet</a> theatre, including the 1999 <i>Kwaidan</i> and the 2002 <i><a href="/wiki/OBON:_Tales_of_Moonlight_and_Rain" id="w">OBON: Tales of Moonlight and Rain</a></i>. </p>
<p>Hearn&#39;s life and works were celebrated in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dream_of_a_Summer_Day" id="w">The Dream of a Summer Day</a></i>, a play that toured Ireland in April and May <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, which was staged by the Storytellers Theatre Company and directed by Liam Halligan. It is a detailed dramatization of Hearn&#39;s life, with four of his ghost stories woven in.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Yone_Noguchi" id="w">Yone Noguchi</a> is quoted as saying about Hearn, <i>&#34;His Greek temperament and French culture became frost-bitten as a flower in the North.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-yonenoguchi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-yonenoguchi" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>There is also a cultural center named for Hearn at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Durham" id="w">University of Durham</a>.</p>
<p>Hearn was a major translator of the short stories of <a href="/wiki/Guy_de_Maupassant" id="w">Guy de Maupassant</a><sup id="_ref-hearnbiblio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hearnbiblio" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In Ian Fleming&#39;s <i>You only Live Twice</i>, James Bond retorts to his nemesis Blofeld&#39;s comment of &#34;Have you ever heard the Japanese expression <i>kirisute gomen</i>?&#34; with &#34;Spare me the Lafcadio Hearn, Blofeld.&#34;</p>
