<p>The <b>New Madrid Earthquake</b>, the largest <a href="/wiki/Earthquake" id="w">earthquake</a> ever recorded in the <a href="/wiki/Continental_United_States" id="w">contiguous United States</a>, occurred on <a href="/wiki/February_7" id="w">February 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1812" id="w">1812</a>. (The largest recorded earthquake in the entire <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> was the <a href="/wiki/Alaska" id="w">Alaskan</a> <a href="/wiki/Good_Friday_Earthquake" id="w">Good Friday Earthquake</a> on <a href="/wiki/March_27" id="w">March 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1964" id="w">1964</a>.) It got its name from its primary location in the <a href="/wiki/New_Madrid_Seismic_Zone" id="w">New Madrid Seismic Zone</a>, near <a href="/wiki/New_Madrid%2C_Missouri" id="w">New Madrid</a>, <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_Territory" id="w">Louisiana Territory</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Missouri" id="w">Missouri</a>). This earthquake was preceded by three other major quakes: two on <a href="/wiki/December_16" id="w">December 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1811" id="w">1811</a>, and one on <a href="/wiki/January_23" id="w">January 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1812" id="w">1812</a>. These earthquakes destroyed approximately half the town of New Madrid. There were also numerous aftershocks in the area for the rest of that winter. There are estimates that the earthquakes were felt strongly over {{convert}}, and moderately across nearly one million square miles. The historic <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_earthquake_of_1906" id="w">San Francisco earthquake of 1906</a>, by comparison, was felt moderately over {{convert}}.</p>
<a id="Effects" name="Effects"></a><h1>Effects</h1>
<p>Based on the effects of these earthquakes, it can be estimated that they had a magnitude of 8.0 on the <a href="/wiki/Richter_scale" id="w">Richter scale</a>. As a result of the quakes, large areas sank into the earth, new lakes were formed (notably <a href="/wiki/Reelfoot_Lake" id="w">Reelfoot Lake</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tennessee" id="w">Tennessee</a>), and the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a> changed its course, creating <a href="/wiki/Kentucky_Bend" id="w">Kentucky Bend</a>. Nearby sections of the Mississippi River appeared to run backwards for a short time. <a href="/wiki/Sand_volcano" id="w">Sandblows</a> were common throughout the area, and their effects can still be seen from the air in cultivated fields. Church bells were reported to ring in <a href="/wiki/Boston%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Boston, Massachusetts</a> and sidewalks were reported to have been cracked and broken in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a> .<sup id="_ref-usgs-factsheet_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-usgs-factsheet" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>A request, dated <a href="/wiki/January_13" id="w">January 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1814" id="w">1814</a>, by <a href="/wiki/William_Clark_(explorer)" id="w">William Clark</a>, the governor of <a href="/wiki/Missouri_Territory" id="w">Missouri Territory</a> (the territory was renamed soon after the quake to eliminate confusion with the new state of <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a>), asked for federal relief for the &#34;inhabitants of New Madrid County&#34;. This was possibly the first example of a request for disaster relief from the US Federal government, which would later become the job of the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency" id="w">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>.</p>
<p>This area was much less developed at the time and a comparable event today would cause significant damage.</p>

The <a href="/wiki/Reelfoot_Rift" id="w">Reelfoot Rift</a> goes back about 750 million years, to when the entire landmass of the earth constituted a single <a href="/wiki/Supercontinent" id="w">supercontinent</a>, designated now as <a href="/wiki/Rodinia" id="w">Rodinia</a>.  At the time a constructive <a href="/wiki/Geologic_fault" id="w">fault zone</a> began to form, now called the Reelfoot Rift, but it failed, and the zone became inactive.  About 550 million years later, at the time of the supercontinent called <a href="/wiki/Pangaea" id="w">Pangaea</a>, the fault zone again became active but no longer functioned as a constructive plate and remains in the same condition today.  The earthquakes are therefore traced to seismic activity 5 to 25 kilometers (3-15&#160;mi) below the <a href="/wiki/Crust_(geology)" id="w">crust</a> of the earth.</p>
<a id="New_Madrid_Seismic_Zone" name="New_Madrid_Seismic_Zone"></a><h1> New Madrid Seismic Zone</h1>
<p>{{main}}
The epicenters of over 4,000 earthquakes can be identified from seismic measurements taken since 1974. It can be seen that the earthquakes originate from the seismic activity of the Reelfoot Rift.   The zone which is strongly colored in red on the map is called the <i>New Madrid Seismic Zone</i>.</p>
<p>The zone remains active today.  In recent decades minor earthquakes have continued.<sup id="_ref-usgs-factsheet_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-usgs-factsheet" title="">[1]</a></sup>  New forecasts estimate a 7 to 10 percent chance, in the next 50 years, of a repeat of a major earthquake like those that occurred in 1811-1812, which likely had magnitudes of between 7.5 and 8.0.  There is a 25 to 40 percent chance, in a 50-year time span, of a magnitude 6.0 or greater earthquake.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The situation is more precarious than it was 200 years ago.  The area is now more densely populated, and many buildings have no <a href="/wiki/Earthquake_construction" id="w">earthquake resistant construction</a>.  A few states have joined forces and founded a special institute  for their earthquake zone, to prepare as well as possible for a major earthquake.  The Mississippi River will probably present one of the incalculable problems.   A few emergency funds for earthquake victims have been founded.  Measures are also being ordered to mitigate any <a href="/wiki/Natural_disaster" id="w">natural disaster</a> resulting from an earthquake; thus in the construction of dams, bridges, and highways, earthquake safety is particularly being taken into account.
Understanding of this earthquake zone is growing slowly in comparison to awareness of the <a href="/wiki/San_Andreas_fault" id="w">San Andreas fault</a>.</p>
<p>Almost 200 years after the earthquakes in 1811 and 1812, the course of the Mississippi River as it was before the events is still visible in the landscape of the affected areas today. Along and parallel to the <a href="/wiki/Tennessee" id="w">Tennessee</a>/<a href="/wiki/Arkansas" id="w">Arkansas</a> state line, the shrunk riverbed is still present.</p>
