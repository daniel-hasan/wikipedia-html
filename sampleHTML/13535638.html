<p>Like many families in Liverpool, the McCartney and Mohan families are from <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Irish</a> descent.

Mary was Paul&#39;s inspiration for the song, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Let_It_Be_(song)" id="w">Let It Be</a>&#34;. After Mary’s death, Jim married Angela Williams and adopted her daughter from a previous marriage, <a href="/wiki/Ruth_McCartney" id="w">Ruth McCartney</a>. </p>

After a year she chose to live with her aunts.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp74_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp74" title="">[11]</a></sup> In 1923, at 14 years old, Mary started her training to become a nurse at the <a href="/wiki/Alder_Hey" id="w">Alder Hey</a> Hospital.

<a id="Marriage" name="Marriage"></a><h1>Marriage</h1>
<p>Mary met her future husband during an air raid on Liverpool in 1940, when Jim was 40-years-old, and had settled into what his friends thought was, &#34;a confirmed bachelorhood.&#34; Mary had been too career-conscious to think of marriage and, at 31-years-old, was thought of as a <a href="/wiki/Spinster" id="w">spinster</a>.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp73_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp73" title="">[31]</a></sup> They met in June 1940, at 11 Scargreen Avenue, <a href="/wiki/West_Derby" id="w">West Derby</a>, as the McCartney family had gathered to celebrate the wedding of Jim&#39;s sister, Jin, to Harry Harris. Mary was staying with Harris family because of the lack of accommodation in Liverpool at the time.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp72_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp72" title="">[32]</a></sup> During the celebration, Mary sat quietly in an armchair, until the air-raid sirens sounded at 9:30. At that time, the group moved to the cellars to wait for the all-clear, but as there was an intensive bombing raid, the message did not come. Everyone was thus forced to sit in the cellar until dawn. Mary talked long enough with Jim to become romantically interested in him, and thought that he was &#34;utterly charming and uncomplicated,&#34; as well as being entertained by his &#34;considerable good humour.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Spitzp73_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp73" title="">[31]</a></sup> They took out a marriage licence at Liverpool Town Hall on <a href="/wiki/8_April" id="w">8 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, and were married a week later at St. Swithin’s Roman Catholic chapel in Gillmoss, West Derby, on <a href="/wiki/15_April" id="w">15 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp75_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp75" title="">[33]</a></sup> They first lived at 10 Sunbury Road, Liverpool, and then resided for a short time at 92 Broadway, <a href="/wiki/Wallasey" id="w">Wallasey</a>, during November 1942. Jim&#39;s job at Napiers was classified as war work, so the McCartneys were given a small, but temporary, <a href="/wiki/Prefabricated_home" id="w">prefab</a> house at 3 Roach Avenue, <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Knowsley" id="w">Knowsley</a>.<sup id="_ref-MilesPage5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MilesPage5" title="">[34]</a></sup> </p>

Jim and Mary would often take Paul and Michael for a walk to the local rustic village of Hale (home of the giant Childe of <a href="/wiki/Hale%2C_Halton" id="w">Hale</a>&#39;s gravesite).

Joe McCartney, Jim&#39;s father, was a traditionalist who liked opera and played an E-flat <a href="/wiki/Tuba" id="w">tuba</a> in the local Territorial Army band that played in Stanley Park, and the Copes&#39; Tobacco factory <a href="/wiki/Brass_Band" id="w">Brass Band</a> where he worked.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp71_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp71" title="">[10]</a></sup> He also played the <a href="/wiki/Double_bass" id="w">double bass</a> at home, sang, and hoped to interest his children in music.<sup id="_ref-MilesPage23_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MilesPage23" title="">[62]</a></sup> Jim learned how to play the <a href="/wiki/Trumpet" id="w">trumpet</a> and <a href="/wiki/Piano" id="w">piano</a> by ear, and at the age of 17 started playing ragtime music.

Jim&#39;s first public appearance was at St Catherine’s Hall, Vine Street, Liverpool, with a band that wore black masks as a gimmick, calling themselves the Masked Melody Makers.
