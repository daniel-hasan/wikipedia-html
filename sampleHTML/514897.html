<p>The <b>Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands</b>, <a href="/wiki/October_26" id="w">October 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>, sometimes referred to as the <b>Battle of Santa Cruz</b> or in Japanese sources as the <b>Battle of the South Pacific</b> (南太平洋海戦), was the fourth <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_carrier" id="w">carrier</a> battle of the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_War" id="w">Pacific campaign</a> of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> and the fourth of five major engagements fought between the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" id="w">United States Navy</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy" id="w">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> during the lengthy and strategically important <a href="/wiki/Guadalcanal_campaign" id="w">Guadalcanal campaign</a>. In similar fashion to the battles of <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Coral_Sea" id="w">Coral Sea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Midway" id="w">Midway</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Eastern_Solomons" id="w">Eastern Solomons</a>, the ships of the two adversaries were rarely in direct <a href="/wiki/Visual_perception" id="w">visual</a> range of each other. Instead, almost all attacks by both sides were mounted by carrier or land-based <a href="/wiki/List_of_aircraft_of_World_War_II" id="w">aircraft</a>.</p>
<p>In an attempt to drive <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" id="w">Allied</a> forces from <a href="/wiki/Guadalcanal" id="w">Guadalcanal</a> and nearby islands and end the stalemate which had existed since September 1942, the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army" id="w">Imperial Japanese Army</a> planned a major ground offensive on Guadalcanal for <a href="/wiki/October_20" id="w">October 20</a>–<a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>. In support of this offensive, and with the hope of engaging Allied naval forces, Japanese carriers and other large warships moved into a position near the southern <a href="/wiki/Solomon_Islands" id="w">Solomon Islands</a>.  From this location, the Japanese naval forces hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) naval forces, especially carrier forces, that responded to the ground offensive. Allied naval forces also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle, with the same objectives of breaking the stalemate and decisively defeating their adversary.</p>
<p>The Japanese ground offensive on Guadalcanal was defeated by Allied ground forces in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_for_Henderson_Field" id="w">Battle for Henderson Field</a>. Nevertheless, the naval warships and aircraft from the two adversaries confronted each other on the morning of <a href="/wiki/October_26" id="w">October 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>, just north of the <a href="/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Islands" id="w">Santa Cruz Islands</a>. After an exchange of carrier <a href="/wiki/Airstrike" id="w">air attacks</a>, Allied <a href="/wiki/Surface_ship" id="w">surface ships</a> were forced to retreat from the battle area with the loss of one carrier sunk and another heavily damaged. The participating Japanese carrier forces, however, also retreated because of high aircraft and <a href="/wiki/Aircrew_member" id="w">aircrew</a> losses plus significant damage to two carriers. Although an apparent tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk and damaged, the loss of many irreplaceable, veteran aircrews by the Japanese provided a long-term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low.</p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h2>Background</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_7" id="w">August 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="/wiki/Tulagi" id="w">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Florida_Islands" id="w">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Solomon_Islands" id="w">Solomon Islands</a>.  The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as <a href="/wiki/Military_base" id="w">bases</a> for threatening the <a href="/wiki/Materiel" id="w">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, and to secure the islands as starting points for a <a href="/wiki/Military_campaign" id="w">campaign</a> with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at <a href="/wiki/Rabaul" id="w">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="/wiki/New_Guinea_campaign" id="w">New Guinea campaign</a>.  The landings initiated the six-month-long <a href="/wiki/Guadalcanal_campaign" id="w">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Eastern_Solomons" id="w">Battle of the Eastern Solomons</a>, in which the aircraft carrier <a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(CV-6)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Enterprise&#39;&#39;</a> was heavily damaged and forced to travel to <a href="/wiki/Pearl_Harbor" id="w">Pearl Harbor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" id="w">Hawaii</a>, for a month of major repairs, three U.S. carrier <a href="/wiki/Task_force" id="w">task forces</a> remained in the South Pacific area.  The task forces included the carriers <a href="/wiki/USS_Wasp_(CV-7)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Wasp&#39;&#39;</a>, <a href="/wiki/USS_Saratoga_(CV-3)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Saratoga&#39;&#39;</a>, and <a href="/wiki/USS_Hornet_(CV-8)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Hornet&#39;&#39;</a> plus their respective <a href="/wiki/Group_(air_force_unit)" id="w">air groups</a> and supporting surface warships, including <a href="/wiki/Battleships" id="w">battleships</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cruiser" id="w">cruisers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Destroyer" id="w">destroyers</a>, and were primarily stationed between the Solomons and <a href="/wiki/New_Hebrides" id="w">New Hebrides</a> (<a href="/wiki/Vanuatu" id="w">Vanuatu</a>) islands.  At this location, the carriers were charged with guarding the line of communication between the major Allied bases at <a href="/wiki/New_Caledonia" id="w">New Caledonia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Espiritu_Santo" id="w">Espiritu Santo</a>, supporting the Allied ground forces at Guadalcanal and Tulagi against any Japanese counteroffensives, covering the movement of supply ships to Guadalcanal, and engaging and destroying any Japanese <a href="/wiki/Warship" id="w">warships</a>, especially carriers, that came within range.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The area of ocean in which the U.S. carrier task forces operated was known as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Torpedo" id="w">Torpedo</a> Junction&#34;<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> by U.S. forces because of the high concentration of Japanese <a href="/wiki/Submarine" id="w">submarines</a> in the area.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  On <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a>, <i>Saratoga</i> was torpedoed by Japanese submarine <a href="/wiki/Japanese_submarine_I-26" id="w">&#39;&#39;I-26&#39;&#39;</a> and was out of action for three months for repairs.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  On <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, while supporting a major reinforcement and resupply convoy to Guadalcanal, and almost engaging Japanese carriers <a href="/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Sh%C5%8Dkaku" id="w">&#39;&#39;Shōkaku&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Zuikaku" id="w">&#39;&#39;Zuikaku&#39;&#39;</a> (who withdrew just before the two adversaries came into range of each other&#39;s aircraft), <i>Wasp</i> was hit by three torpedoes fired by Japanese submarine <a href="/wiki/Japanese_submarine_I-19" id="w">&#39;&#39;I-19&#39;&#39;</a>.  With power knocked out from torpedo damage, <i>Wasp</i>’s <a href="/wiki/Damage_control" id="w">damage-control</a> teams were unable to contain the ensuing large fires, and she was abandoned and <a href="/wiki/Scuttling" id="w">scuttled</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the U.S. now had only one operational carrier (<i>Hornet</i>) in the South Pacific, the Allies still maintained <a href="/wiki/Air_superiority" id="w">air superiority</a> over the southern Solomon Islands because of their aircraft based at <a href="/wiki/Honiara_International_Airport" id="w">Henderson Field</a> on Guadalcanal.  However, at night, when aircraft were not able to operate effectively, the Japanese were able to operate their ships around Guadalcanal almost at will.  Thus, a <a href="/wiki/Stalemate" id="w">stalemate</a> in the battle for Guadalcanal developed, with the Allies delivering supplies and reinforcements to Guadalcanal during the day, and the Japanese delivering supplies and reinforcements by warship (called the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Express" id="w">Tokyo Express</a>&#34; by the Allies) at night with neither side able to deliver enough troops to the island to secure a decisive advantage.  By mid-October, both sides had roughly an equal number of troops on the island.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>  The stalemate was briefly interrupted by two large-ship naval actions.  On the night of <a href="/wiki/October_11" id="w">October 11</a>–<a href="/wiki/October_12" id="w">October 12</a>, a U.S. warship force intercepted and defeated a Japanese warship force that was enroute to bombard Henderson Field in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_Esperance" id="w">Battle of Cape Esperance</a>.  But, just two nights later a Japanese force that included battleships <a href="/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Haruna" id="w">&#39;&#39;Haruna&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Kong%C5%8D" id="w">&#39;&#39;Kongō&#39;&#39;</a> successfully bombarded Henderson Field, destroying most of the U.S. aircraft and inflicting severe damage on the field&#39;s facilities.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>  Although still marginally operational, it took several weeks for the airfield to recover from the damage and replace the destroyed aircraft.</p>

At this time, the U.S. made two moves to try to break the stalemate in the battle for Guadalcanal.  First, repairs to <i>Enterprise</i> were expedited so that she could return to the South Pacific as soon as possible.  On <a href="/wiki/October_10" id="w">October 10</a>, <i>Enterprise</i> received her new air groups; on <a href="/wiki/October_16" id="w">October 16</a>, she left Pearl Harbor; and on <a href="/wiki/October_23" id="w">October 23</a>,<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> she arrived back in the South Pacific and rendezvoused with <i>Hornet</i> and the rest of the Allied South Pacific naval forces on <a href="/wiki/October_24" id="w">October 24</a>, 273&#160;<a href="/wiki/Nautical_mile" id="w">nautical miles</a> (505&#160;km) northeast of <a href="/wiki/Espiritu_Santo" id="w">Espiritu Santo</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Second, on <a href="/wiki/October_18" id="w">October 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/Admiral" id="w">Admiral</a> <a href="/wiki/Chester_Nimitz" id="w">Chester Nimitz</a>, Allied Commander in Chief of Pacific Forces, replaced <a href="/wiki/Vice_Admiral" id="w">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_L._Ghormley" id="w">Robert L.

Halsey was reportedly respected throughout the U.S. naval fleet as a &#34;fighter.&#34;<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>  Upon assuming command, Halsey immediately began making plans to draw the Japanese naval forces into a battle, writing to Nimitz, &#34;I had to begin throwing punches almost immediately.&#34;<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Japanese Combined Fleet was also seeking to draw Allied naval forces into what was hoped to be a decisive battle.  Two fleet carriers, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Hiy%C5%8D" id="w">&#39;&#39;Hiyō&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Juny%C5%8D" id="w">&#39;&#39;Junyō&#39;&#39;</a>, plus one light carrier, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Zuih%C5%8D" id="w">&#39;&#39;Zuihō&#39;&#39;</a>, arrived at the main Japanese naval base at <a href="/wiki/Chuuk" id="w">Truk</a> from Japan in early October and joined <i>Shōkaku</i> and <i>Zuikaku.</i>  With five carriers fully equipped with air groups, plus their numerous battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, the Japanese Combined Fleet, directed by Admiral <a href="/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto" id="w">Isoroku Yamamoto</a>, was confident that they could make up for their defeat at the Battle of Midway.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>  Apart from a couple of air raids on Henderson Field in October, the Japanese carriers and their supporting warships stayed out of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Guadalcanal" id="w">battle for Guadalcanal</a> in the northwestern area of the <a href="/wiki/Solomon_Islands" id="w">Solomon Islands</a>, waiting for a chance to approach and engage the U.S. carriers.  With the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Japanese_Imperial_Army" id="w">Army&#39;s</a> next planned major ground attack on Allied forces on Guadalcanal set for <a href="/wiki/October_20" id="w">October 20</a>, Yamamoto&#39;s warships began to position themselves towards the southern Solomons to support the army offensive on Guadalcanal, and to be ready to engage any Allied (primarily U.S.) ships, especially carriers, that approached to support the Allied defenses on Guadalcanal.  The Japanese believed that U.S. Navy forces were likely to be in the Solomons Island area because they had read a report from the <a href="/wiki/United_Press" id="w">United Press</a> dated <a href="/wiki/October_20" id="w">October 20</a> that stated that the United States Navy was preparing for a major sea and air battle in the South Pacific.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Battle" name="Battle"></a><h2>Battle</h2>
<a id="Prelude" name="Prelude"></a><h3>Prelude</h3>
<p>From <a href="/wiki/October_20" id="w">October 20</a> to <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a>, Japanese land forces on Guadalcanal attempted to capture Henderson Field with a large-scale attack against U.S. troops defending the airfield.

<p>Incorrectly believing that the Japanese army troops had succeeded in capturing Henderson Field, a force of Japanese warships approached Guadalcanal on the morning of <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a> to provide further support for the army offensive.

Despite the failure of the Japanese ground offensive and the loss of <i>Yura</i>, the rest of the Combined Fleet continued to maneuver near the southern Solomon Islands on <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a> with the hope of encountering Allied naval forces in battle.  The Japanese naval forces included four carriers, because <i>Hiyō</i> had suffered an accidental, damaging fire on <a href="/wiki/October_22" id="w">October 22</a> that forced her to return to Truk for repairs.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>  The Japanese naval forces were divided into three groups:  The &#34;Advanced&#34; force contained <i>Junyō</i>, plus two battleships, four <a href="/wiki/Heavy_cruiser" id="w">heavy cruisers</a>, one light cruiser, and 10 destroyers, and was commanded by Vice Admiral <a href="/wiki/Nobutake_Kondo" id="w">Nobutake Kondo</a> in heavy cruiser <a href="/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_Atago" id="w">&#39;&#39;Atago&#39;&#39;</a>; the &#34;Main Body&#34; consisted of <i>Shōkaku</i>, <i>Zuikaku</i>, and <i>Zuihō</i> plus one heavy cruiser and eight destroyers, and was commanded by Vice Admiral <a href="/wiki/Chuichi_Nagumo" id="w">Chuichi Nagumo</a> in <i>Shōkaku</i>; the &#34;Vanguard&#34; force contained two battleships, three heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and seven destroyers, and was commanded by Rear Admiral <a href="/wiki/Hiroaki_Abe" id="w">Hiroaki Abe</a> in battleship <a href="/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Hiei" id="w">&#39;&#39;Hiei&#39;&#39;</a>.  In addition to commanding the Advanced force, Kondo acted as the overall commander of the three forces.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the U.S. side, the <i>Hornet</i> and <i>Enterprise</i> task groups, under the overall command of Rear Admiral <a href="/wiki/Thomas_C._Kinkaid" id="w">Thomas Kinkaid</a> swept around to the north of the Santa Cruz Islands on <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a> searching for the Japanese naval forces.  The U.S. warships were deployed as two separate carrier groups, each centered on either <i>Hornet</i> or <i>Enterprise</i>, and separated from each other by about 10&#160;<a href="/wiki/Nautical_mile" id="w">nmi</a> (19&#160;km).  A U.S. <a href="/wiki/PBY_Catalina" id="w">PBY Catalina</a> based in the Santa Cruz Islands located the Japanese Main body carriers at 11:03.  However, the Japanese carriers were about 355&#160;nmi (655&#160;km) from the U.S. force, just beyond carrier aircraft range.  Kinkaid, hoping to close the range to be able to execute an attack that day, steamed towards the Japanese carriers at top speed and, at 14:25, launched a strike force of 23 aircraft.  But the Japanese, knowing that they had been spotted by U.S. aircraft and not knowing where the U.S. carriers were, turned to the north to stay out of range of the U.S. carriers&#39; aircraft.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>  Thus, the U.S. strike force returned to their carriers without finding or attacking the Japanese warships.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

<p>At 02:50 on <a href="/wiki/October_26" id="w">October 26</a>, the Japanese naval forces reversed direction and the naval forces of the two adversaries closed the distance until they were only 200&#160;nmi (370&#160;km) away from each other by 05:00.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>  Both sides launched search aircraft and prepared their remaining aircraft to attack as soon as the other side&#39;s ships were located.  Although a <a href="/wiki/Radar" id="w">radar</a>-equipped <a href="/wiki/PBY_Catalina" id="w">PBY Catalina</a> sighted the Japanese carriers at 03:10, the report did not reach Kinkaid until 05:12.

With the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Combat_air_patrol" id="w">combat air patrol</a> (CAP) busy chasing other U.S. scout aircraft away, the two U.S. aircraft were able to approach and drop both of their bombs on <i>Zuihō</i>, causing heavy damage and preventing the carrier&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Flight_deck" id="w">flight deck</a> from being able to land aircraft.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kondo ordered Abe&#39;s Vanguard force to race ahead to try to intercept and engage the U.S. warships.  Kondo also brought his own Advanced force forward at maximum speed so that <i>Junyō’s</i> aircraft could join in the attacks on the U.S. ships.

<p>The U.S. strike aircraft were running about 20 minutes behind the Japanese.  Believing that a speedy attack was more important than a massed attack, the U.S. aircraft proceeded in small groups towards the Japanese ships instead of forming into one large strike force.  The first group, consisting of 15 SBD dive bombers, six <a href="/wiki/TBF_Avenger" id="w">TBF Avenger</a> torpedo bombers, and eight <a href="/wiki/F4F_Wildcat" id="w">F4F Wildcat</a> fighters from <i>Hornet</i>, was on its way by about 08:00.  A second group, consisting of three SBDs, seven TBFs, and eight Wildcats from <i>Enterprise</i> was off by 08:10.  A third group, which included nine SBDs, eight TBFs, and seven Wildcats from <i>Hornet</i>, was on its way by 08:20.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>At 08:30, the opposing aircraft strike formations began passing within sight of each other.  Nine Zeros from <i>Zuihō</i> broke off from their formation and attacked the <i>Enterprise</i> group of aircraft.  In the resulting engagement, four Zeros, three Wildcats, and two TBFs were shot down, with another two TBFs forced to return to <i>Enterprise</i> with heavy damage.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>At 08:50, the lead U.S. attack formation from <i>Hornet</i> spotted four ships from Abe&#39;s Vanguard force.  Pressing on, the U.S. aircraft sighted the Japanese carriers and prepared to attack.  Three Zeros from <i>Zuihō</i> attacked the formation&#39;s Wildcats, drawing them away from the bombers they were assigned to protect.  Thus, the dive bombers in the first group initiated their attacks without fighter escort.  Twenty Zeros from the Japanese carrier CAP attacked the SBD formation and shot down four of them.  The remaining 11 SBDs commenced their attack dives on <i>Shōkaku</i> at 09:27, hitting her with three to six bombs, ruining her flight deck and causing serious damage to the interior of the ship.  The final SBD of the 11 lost track of the <i>Shōkaku</i> and instead dropped its bomb near the Japanese destroyer <a href="/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Teruzuki" id="w">&#39;&#39;Teruzuki&#39;&#39;</a>, causing minor damage.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>  The six TBFs in the first strike force, having become separated from their strike group, missed finding the Japanese carriers and eventually turned-back towards <i>Hornet</i>.

At 09:09, the <a href="/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare" id="w">anti-aircraft</a> guns of <i>Hornet</i> and her escorting warships opened fire as the 20 untouched Japanese Kates and remaining 16 Vals commenced their attacks on the carrier.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup>  At 09:12, a Val placed its 250-kilogram, semi-armor-piercing bomb dead center on <i>Hornet</i>’s flight deck, across from the island, which penetrated three decks before exploding, killing 60 men.  Moments later, a <a href="/wiki/List_of_Japanese_World_War_II_navy_bombs" id="w">242-kilogram &#34;land&#34; bomb</a> struck the flight deck, detonating on impact and creating an 11-foot (3.3 m) hole as well as killing 30 men.  A minute or so later, a third bomb hit <i>Hornet</i> near where the first bomb hit, penetrating three decks before exploding, causing severe damage but no direct loss of life.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup>  At 09:14, a diving Val was hit and damaged by anti-aircraft fire directly over <i>Hornet</i>.

<p>At the same time that the Vals were attacking, the Japanese Kate torpedo bombers were also attacking <i>Hornet</i> from two different directions. Despite suffering heavy losses from anti-aircraft fire, the Kates planted two torpedoes in <i>Hornet</i> between 09:13 and 09:17, knocking-out her engines.  As <i>Hornet</i> glided to a stop, a damaged Val approached and purposely crashed into the carrier&#39;s side, starting a fire near the ship&#39;s main supply of aviation fuel.  At 09:20, the surviving Japanese aircraft departed, leaving <i>Hornet</i> dead in the water and burning.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup>  Twenty-five Japanese<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> and six U.S. aircraft were destroyed in this first attack on <i>Hornet</i>.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the assistance of firehoses from three escorting destroyers, the fires on <i>Hornet</i> were under control by 10:00.  Wounded personnel were evacuated from the carrier, and an attempt was made by the cruiser <a href="/wiki/USS_Northampton_(CA-26)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Northampton&#39;&#39;</a> to tow <i>Hornet</i> away from the battle area.  However, the effort to rig the towline took some time, and more attack waves of Japanese aircraft were inbound.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

At 15:23, one torpedo struck <i>Hornet</i>, destroying the repairs to the power system, causing heavy flooding and a 14-degree list.  With no power to pump out the water, <i>Hornet</i> was given up for lost, and the crew abandoned ship.  The third strike from <i>Zuikaku</i> attacked <i>Hornet</i> during this time, hitting the sinking ship with one more bomb.  All of the <i>Hornet</i>’s crewmen were off by 16:27.

During the U.S. retreat from the battle area towards Espiritu Santo and New Caledonia, <i>South Dakota</i> collided with destroyer <a href="/wiki/USS_Mahan_(DD-364)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Mahan&#39;&#39;</a>, heavily damaging the destroyer.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>

The loss of <i>Hornet</i> was a severe blow for Allied forces in the South Pacific, leaving just one operational, albeit damaged, Allied carrier in the entire Pacific theater.  <i>Enterprise</i>, however, received temporary repairs at New Caledonia and, although still somewhat damaged, returned to the southern Solomons area just two weeks later to support Allied forces during the <a href="/wiki/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal" id="w">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a>, playing an important role in what turned out to be the decisive naval engagement in the overall battle for Guadalcanal.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk, it came at a high cost for Japanese naval forces.  Both damaged carriers were forced to return to Japan for extensive repairs and refitting.  After repair, <i>Zuihō</i> returned to Truk in late January 1943.  <i>Shōkaku</i> was under repair until March 1943 and did not return to the front until July 1943, when she was reunited with <i>Zuikaku</i> at Truk.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>The most significant losses for the Japanese Navy, however, were in aircrew.  The U.S. lost 26 aircrew members in the battle.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup>  The Japanese, on the other hand, lost 148 aircrew members including two dive bomber group leaders, three torpedo squadron leaders, and 18 other section or flight leaders.  Forty-nine percent of the Japanese torpedo bomber aircrews involved in the battle were killed along with 39% of the dive bomber crews and 20% of the fighter pilots.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup>  The Japanese lost so many aircrew members that undamaged <i>Zuikaku</i> and <i>Hiyō</i> were also forced to return to Japan because of a scarcity of trained aircrew to man their air groups.  Admiral Nagumo, upon being relieved of command shortly after the battle and reassigned to shore duty in Japan, stated, {{Cquote}}</p>
<p>With its carrier aircrew ranks decimated, and with no quick way to replace them, Japan lost its strategic opportunity to defeat Allied naval forces in a single, decisive battle before the industrial might of the U.S. placed that goal out of reach.  Although they returned to Truk by the summer of 1943, the Japanese carriers played no further offensive role in the decisive Solomon Islands campaign.  <a href="/wiki/Historian" id="w">Historian</a> <a href="/wiki/Eric_M._Hammel" id="w">Eric Hammel</a> sums up the significance of the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands this way:
