<a id="Leadership_and_death" name="Leadership_and_death"></a><h2> Leadership and death </h2>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1660" id="w">1660</a>, Massasoit died and Wamsutta assumed leadership of the Wampanoag. He substantially increased the power of the Wampanoag by selling land to other colonies (as a result of a collapse of the <a href="/wiki/Fur_trade" id="w">fur trade</a>), and in <a href="/wiki/1662" id="w">1662</a> this resulted in his being summoned to and seized by the <a href="/wiki/Plymouth_Colony" id="w">Plymouth</a> Court. After being questioned Wamsutta became ill and died. The cause of death was disputed, and his brother Metacomet (who now assumed leadership of the Wampanoag) suspected that he was poisoned.</p>
<p>Wamsutta&#39;s death was one of the factors that would eventually lead to the <a href="/wiki/1675" id="w">1675</a> <a href="/wiki/King_Philip%26%2339%3Bs_War" id="w">King Philip&#39;s War</a>.</p>
