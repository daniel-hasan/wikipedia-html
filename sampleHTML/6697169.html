<p>The <b>weapon dance</b> employs <a href="/wiki/Weapon" id="w">weapons</a>—or stylized versions of weapons—traditionally used in <a href="/wiki/Combat" id="w">combat</a> in order to simulate, recall, or reenact combat or the moves of combat in the form of <a href="/wiki/Dance" id="w">dance</a>, usually for some <a href="/wiki/Ceremony" id="w">ceremonial</a> purpose. Such dancing is quite common to folk <a href="/wiki/Ritual" id="w">ritual</a> in many parts of the world. Weapon dancing is certainly ancient; among the earliest historical references we have are those that refer to the <i>pyrhhic</i>, a weapon dance in ancient <a href="/wiki/Sparta" id="w">Sparta</a>, in which the dance was used as a kind of ritual training for battle.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>There are virtually no parts of the world left where the weapon dance is directly connected with imminent or recent combat. This is especially true of <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>, the nation states of which have long since transcended the <a href="/wiki/Tribalism" id="w">tribalism</a> that gave rise to such folk dances. It is, however, also true of parts of the world where tribal traditions have succumbed only quite recently to <a href="/wiki/Colonialism" id="w">colonialism</a> and the forces of <a href="/wiki/Globalization" id="w">globalism</a>. Thus, the dances that one sees today are part of general movements to preserve and rejuvenate tribal or local traditions—a backlash, if you will, against the leveling forces of globalism. Some of these movements are quite strong now, such as those among native North American tribes and the aboriginal peoples of Australia.</p>
<p>Beyond the scope of this article are the many examples around the world of ritual combat, which, though not dance, has its anthropologically fascinating aspects of purification, getting rid of hostile or dangerous spirits, acting as a surrogate for real battle and even, in ancient times, of being a kind of human sacrifice. Some writers have suggested that even Roman gladiatorial combat was a kind of human sacrifice, a ritual weapon display with the winner often going free.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Function_of_the_weapon_dance" name="Function_of_the_weapon_dance"></a><h2>Function of the weapon dance</h2>
<p>In the modern world, dance has come to be regarded as something one does for recreation, thus distancing dance from the important place it has held in many human cultures throughout history—that is, a method of expression, preservation and transmission of the culture and history of a people. Many of the activities that humans have engaged in for millennia (religion and courtship, for example) have traditionally found expression in various kinds of dance. Another activity—combat—has obviously been central to the life of most human cultures; thus, one expects to find dances that celebrate skill in the use of weapons. Indeed, there is a wide range of such weapon dances in the world; they vary from general displays of prowess in the use of weapons to reenactments of real episodes of combat specific to a given culture.</p>

Sword dancing exists in some parts of Europe. The weapon may be used to act out mock combat during the dance, or may be incorporated as an element of the dance itself, intertwining with other swords. In some places, sticks are used instead of swords. Iberian stick dances (<i><a href="/wiki/Paulitos" id="w">paulitos</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Paloteos" id="w">paloteos</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Ball_de_bastons" id="w">ball de bastons</a></i>) display two opposite rows of dancers.  A common sword dance in Europe is the <i><a href="/wiki/Moresca" id="w">moresca</a></i> in Spain, in which the dance recalls <a href="/wiki/Reconquista" id="w">the strife between Christians and Muslims</a> in that country from the 12th-15th century.<sup id="_ref-Wolfram_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wolfram" title="">[4]</a></sup>

Northern-Portuguese <i><a href="/wiki/Jogo_do_pau" id="w">jogo do pau</a></i> involves two rivals with long sticks.

Hilt-and-point sword dances exist in many places in Europe. In this kind of dance the swords interlock to form a “rose,” or “lock,” that is placed around the neck of a participant to simulate decapitation. As well, crossed-sword dances are common in Europe. Typically, dancers execute complicated patterns of steps over and between the swords. In some variations, <a href="/wiki/Clay_pipe" id="w">clay pipes</a> may replace the swords. Many European sword dances were appropriated by trade guilds, with tools replacing the swords. In Turkey and Greece there exists a <a href="/wiki/Butchers%E2%80%99_dance" id="w">butchers’ dance</a> called the <i><a href="/wiki/Hassapikos" id="w">hassapikos</a></i>. It is now a social dance, but goes back to a battle mime in the Middle Ages performed with swords and performed by members of by the butchers&#39; guild.  Also in Turkey are the so-called “guerrilla dances”, performed by dances arranged in a circle who make swishing and whiffling sounds with their swords (possibly to clear the area of evil spirits), followed by mock combat.  </p>
<p>Chain-sword dance is a group dance in which the dancers first use a sword or other implement (stick, stave, etc.) to link themselves in a chain. In the <a href="/wiki/Hungarian_folklore" id="w">Hungarian tradition</a>, the <i><a href="/wiki/Erd%C5%91b%C3%A9nye" id="w">Erdőbénye</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Cooper_dance" id="w">cooper dance</a> represents this form of dance. A dance similar to the <i>moresca</i> exists on the Adriatic island of <a href="/wiki/Kor%C4%8Dula" id="w">Korčula</a>, recalling combat between Christians and Muslims. Historically, the Hungarin <i><a href="/wiki/Heyduck" id="w">heyduck</a></i> dance was a soldiers&#39; dance that involved vituoso whirling of weapons and free-form compositions with battle practice motifs. Such dances also appear in <a href="/wiki/Roma_people" id="w">Gypsy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Slovaks" id="w">Slovak</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ruthenian" id="w">Ruthenian</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Transylvanian" id="w">Transylvanian</a> folklore.

<p>The <i>Jerusema</i> (or <i>Mbenede</i>) dance of the Zezuru people in <a href="/wiki/Zimbabwe" id="w">Zimbabwe</a> is an interesting kind of hybrid war dance--&#34;hybrid&#34; in the sense that music and dance formed a part of the actual battle-field preparations, themselves, as well as of the ritual dance recalling the battle.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> (The Zezuru are one of the <a href="/wiki/Shona" id="w">Shona</a> peoples who were the builders of the great monuments of the <a href="/wiki/Monomotapa" id="w">Monomotapa</a> kingdom in Zimbabwe between the 10th and 15th centuries.)

So-called “war dances” of indigenous North American tribes may also be classified as weapon dances.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>  Recent interest in preserving Native American traditions has led to such groups as <a href="/wiki/The_Warriors_of_AniKituhwa" id="w">The Warriors of AniKituhwa</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Cherokee" id="w">Cherokee</a> dance group who recreate Cherokee dances, including the war dance, do research and offer dance workshops for their community.

<p>Also, the <i>moresca</i> (or <i><a href="/wiki/Morisca" id="w">morisca</a></i>) (<a href="/wiki/#Europe" id="w">above</a>) exists in some areas in the Americas that used to be Spanish colonies--Mexico, for example.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup>
In the <a href="/wiki/Jamiltepec" id="w">Jamiltepec</a> region of <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a>, there exists perhaps the most colorful version of that kind of dance, the <a href="/wiki/Chareos" id="w">Chareos</a> dance.

Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, <a href="/wiki/Red_flag" id="w">red</a> symbolizing the blood spilt by James&#39; soldiers and <a href="/wiki/White_flag" id="w">white</a> symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory.

These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where one sees them and under what conditions—it is plausible to read into the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration from the fact that the natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders. <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

The performance of this dance represents a battle between Aztecs and Spaniards, and dancers perform with rattles made of thin metal plates and wooden <a href="/wiki/Cudgel" id="w">cudgels</a>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

<p>The landscape of all dance in a large country such as Brazil is rich and complex due to the mixing of three separate traditions—Indian native, Black African, and Portuguese.<sup id="_ref- Andrade _a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- Andrade " title="">[29]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/Brazil" id="w">Brazil</a>, the African influence on Brazilian folkdances is considerable. For example, <i>capoeira</i> – a dance-like fighting style -- and the <i>maculelê</i> fighting dance are strongly reminiscent of African dances. <a href="/wiki/Capoeira" id="w">Capoeira</a> is of particular interest. In the 1800s, Capoeira was played mostly by slaves who had been brought from West Central Africa and was a complex form of social interaction, expressing the participants&#39; physical skills and spiritual essence, involving the gods and the spirits of the ancestral fathers. The participants played during festivals and holidays, jumping and leaping in front of musical bands, military troops, and religious processions. This dance “game” was considered dangerous to public order and was eventually criminalized in the late 1800s.<sup id="_ref- Chvaicer _a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- Chvaicer " title="">[30]</a></sup>
Today, <i>capoeira</i> has staged somewhat of a comeback and is even studied in dance academies as part of a general movement to rejuvenate folk traditions. Capoeira may be played unarmed or with blades held in the hands or feet.</p>
<p>The sticks used as mock weapons in some of these dances also serve as  percussion instruments.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> In the southern state of <a href="/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul" id="w">Rio Grande do Sul</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Machete" id="w">machete</a>, a tool used to cut jungle brush, is used in a dance called <i>dança dos facões</i> (dance of the machetes). In this dance (historically performed only by men, although this trend changes as the dance spreads), the dancers knock their machetes while dancing, simulating a battle.</p>
<a id="Weapon_dance_as_art" name="Weapon_dance_as_art"></a><h2>Weapon dance as art</h2>

<p>Since dance is already an art form, “weapon dance as art” may seem redundant; yet, “art” is used here to mean the re-creation, say, of a folk weapon dance in a more professional staged venue, such as a ballet, or when an Australian, Native American, or African troupe of professional musicians and dancers present a reenactment on stage of a weapon dance, or when the use of weapons is introduced in stylized dance enactments of fighting. For example, recent ballets such as the New York City Ballet’s version of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> (to the music of <a href="/wiki/Sergei_Prokofiev" id="w">Sergei Prokofiev</a>) employ highly choreographed sword-fight/dance sequences. <sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Additionally, there is overlap between weapon dance and stylized forms of stage combat, i.e., choreographed enactments of “real fights,” from bar-room brawls to sword-fighting to large-scale battle scenes. Stage combat uses the services of professionals called “fight directors,”  “weapon choreographers,” etc. An early example of this kind of staged combat in Europe was in Italy in the late 19th century, where the term <i>tramagnini</i> came to be used generically in the sense of “extra” or “stunt man” for those who fought on the stage in enactments of battle scenes in grand opera, for example. <i>Tramagnini</i> was originally a family name in Florence and referred to members of the family who started a gymnastics club and soon wound up appearing on stage in enactments of fighting, both bare-handed and with weapons. <sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Elsewhere, the <a href="/wiki/Kabuki" id="w">Kabuki</a> theater tradition in Japan employs ritualized representations of violence on the stage. While Kabuki is technically theater and not dance, the movements, for example, of the sword-fighting termed <i>tachimawari</i> in Kabuki are gymnastic to the point even of employing somersaults, and elaborate fight scenes are so deliberate and stylized that they provide at least an area of overlap between theater and dance. <sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also, the Communist revolution in China produced the view that art—including dance—must support the “armed struggle of the proletariat.” By the 1970s, weapons commonly appeared in such works as ‘’Red Detachment of Women,’’ a ballet about a women’s revolutionary armed force in the 1930s in China. <sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>  
<p>Interesting, perhaps, in the use of weapons in these recent “revolutionary” works is that they are, generally speaking, not reenactments of traditional folk dances. The introduction of weaponry into Chinese ballet—regardless of the revolutionary message—was, itself, a revolution.</p>
