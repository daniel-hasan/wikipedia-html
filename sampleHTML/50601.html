<b>Cystic fibrosis</b> (<b>CF</b>) is a <a href="/wiki/Genetic_disorder" id="w">hereditary disease</a> that affects mainly the lungs and digestive system, causing progressive disability, and, for most, early death.  Formerly known as cystic fibrosis of the <a href="/wiki/Pancreas" id="w">pancreas</a>, this entity has increasingly been labeled simply <i>cystic fibrosis</i>.<sup id="_ref-pancreas_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pancreas" title="">[1]</a></sup> Average life expectancy is around 36.8 years, although improvements in treatments mean a baby born today could expect to live longer.<sup id="_ref-median_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-median" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Dypsnea" id="w">Difficulty breathing</a> and insufficient enzyme production in the pancreas are the most common symptoms. Thick mucus production, as well as a less competent immune system, results in frequent <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" id="w">lung infections</a>, which are treated, though not always cured, by oral and intravenous <a href="/wiki/Antibiotics" id="w">antibiotics</a> and other medications. A multitude of other symptoms, including <a href="/wiki/Sinusitis" id="w">sinus infections</a>, <a href="/wiki/Failure_to_thrive" id="w">poor growth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diarrhea" id="w">diarrhea</a>, and potential <a href="/wiki/Infertility" id="w">infertility</a> (mostly in males, due to the condition <a href="/wiki/CBAVD" id="w">Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens</a>) result from the effects of CF on other parts of the body.  Often, symptoms of CF appear in infancy and childhood;  these include <a href="/wiki/Meconium_ileus" id="w">meconium ileus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Failure_to_thrive" id="w">failure to thrive</a>, and recurrent lung infections.</p>
<p>Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common life-shortening, childhood-onset inherited diseases.  In the United States, 1 in 3900 children is born with CF.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  It is most common among <a href="/wiki/European_ethnic_groups" id="w">Europeans</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews" id="w">Ashkenazi Jews</a>; one in twenty-two people of European descent <a href="/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier" id="w">carry</a> one gene for CF, making it the most common genetic disease among such people.</p>
<p>Individuals with cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed prior to birth by <a href="/wiki/Genetic_testing" id="w">genetic testing</a> or in early childhood by a <a href="/wiki/Sweat_test" id="w">sweat test</a>. Newborn screening tests are increasingly common and effective. There is no cure for CF, and most individuals with cystic fibrosis die young: many in their 20s and 30s from lung failure.  However, with the continuous introduction of many new treatments, the life expectancy of a person with CF is increasing. <a href="/wiki/Lung_transplantation" id="w">Lung transplantation</a> is often necessary as CF worsens.</p>
<p>CF is caused by a <a href="/wiki/Mutation" id="w">mutation</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Gene" id="w">gene</a> called the <a href="/wiki/CFTR_(gene)" id="w">cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator</a> (CFTR).  The <a href="/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis_transmembrane_conductance_regulator" id="w">product of this gene</a> is a chloride ion channel important in creating sweat, <a href="/wiki/Digestion" id="w">digestive</a> juices, and <a href="/wiki/Mucus" id="w">mucus</a>. Although most people without CF have two working copies of the CFTR gene, only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis. CF develops when neither gene works normally. Therefore, CF is considered an <a href="/wiki/Autosome" id="w">autosomal</a> <a href="/wiki/Recessive_gene" id="w">recessive</a> disease. The name <i>cystic fibrosis</i> refers to the characteristic &#39;fibrosis&#39; (tissue scarring) and cyst formation within the pancreas, first recognized in the 1930s.<sup id="_ref-andersen_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-andersen" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The symptoms of cystic fibrosis depend on the age of an individual, the extent the disease affects specific organs, prior therapy, and the types of infections experienced. Cystic fibrosis affects the entire body and impacts breathing, digestion, and sexual reproduction. The newborn period may be marked by poor weight gain and intestinal blockage caused by thick feces. Other symptoms of CF appear during the remainder of childhood and early adulthood. These include continued problems with growth, the onset of lung disease, and increasing difficulties with poor absorption of vitamins and nutrients by the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, difficulties with fertility may become apparent when reproduction is attempted.</p>

<a id="Lung_and_sinus_disease" name="Lung_and_sinus_disease"></a><h3>Lung and sinus disease</h3>
<p>Lung disease results from clogging of airways due to inflammation. <a href="/wiki/Inflammation" id="w">Inflammation</a> and infection cause injury to the lungs and structural changes that lead to a variety of symptoms. In the early stages, incessant coughing, copious <a href="/wiki/Phlegm" id="w">phlegm</a> production, and decreased ability to exercise are common. Many of these symptoms occur when <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" id="w">bacteria</a> that normally inhabit the thick mucus grow out of control and cause pneumonia. In later stages of CF, changes in the architecture of the lung further exacerbate chronic difficulties in breathing. <div style="wigth:200px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:200px-Aspergillus_fumigatus_01.jpg" title="&#39;&#39;&#39;Aspergillus fumigatus -&#39;&#39;&#39; A common fungus which can lead to worsening lung disease in people with CF"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200px-Aspergillus_fumigatus_01.jpg" alt="&#39;&#39;&#39;Aspergillus fumigatus -&#39;&#39;&#39; A common fungus which can lead to worsening lung disease in people with CF" title="&#39;&#39;&#39;Aspergillus fumigatus -&#39;&#39;&#39; A common fungus which can lead to worsening lung disease in people with CF" class="location-left type-thumb" width="200px" />

 symptoms include coughing up blood (<a href="/wiki/Hemoptysis" id="w">hemoptysis</a>), changes in the major airways in the lungs (<a href="/wiki/Bronchiectasis" id="w">bronchiectasis</a>), high <a href="/wiki/Blood_pressure" id="w">blood pressure</a> in the lung (<a href="/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension" id="w">pulmonary hypertension</a>), <a href="/wiki/Heart_failure" id="w">heart failure</a>, difficulties getting enough <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" id="w">oxygen</a> to the body, and respiratory failure requiring support with breathing masks such as <a href="/wiki/Bilevel_positive_airway_pressure" id="w">bilevel positive airway pressure</a> machines or <a href="/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation" id="w">ventilators</a>.<sup id="_ref-Rowe_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rowe" title="">[5]</a></sup> In addition to typical bacterial infections, people with CF more commonly develop other types of lung disease. Among these is <a href="/wiki/Allergic_bronchopulmonary_aspergillosis" id="w">allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis</a>, in which the body&#39;s response to the common <a href="/wiki/Fungus" id="w">fungus</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Aspergillus_fumigatus" id="w">Aspergillus fumigatus</a></i> causes worsening of breathing problems. Another is infection with <i><a href="/wiki/Mycobacterium_avium_complex" id="w">mycobacterium avium complex</a></i> (MAC), a group of bacteria related to <a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis" id="w">tuberculosis</a>, which can cause further lung damage and does not respond to common antibiotics. 
Mucus in the <a href="/wiki/Paranasal_sinus" id="w">paranasal sinuses</a> is equally thick and may also cause blockage of the sinus passages, leading to infection. This may cause facial pain, fever, nasal drainage, and <a href="/wiki/Headache" id="w">headaches</a>. Individuals with CF may develop overgrowth of the nasal tissue (<a href="/wiki/Nasal_polyp" id="w">nasal polyps</a>) due to inflammation from chronic sinus infections These polyps can block the nasal passages and increase breathing difficulties.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Gastrointestinal%2C_liver_and_pancreatic_disease" name="Gastrointestinal%2C_liver_and_pancreatic_disease"></a><h3>Gastrointestinal, liver and pancreatic disease</h3>
<p>Prior to prenatal and <a href="/wiki/Newborn_screening" id="w">newborn screening</a>, cystic fibrosis was often diagnosed when a newborn infant failed to pass faeces (<a href="/wiki/Meconium" id="w">meconium</a>). Meconium may completely block the <a href="/wiki/Small_intestine" id="w">intestines</a> and cause serious illness. This condition, called <a href="/wiki/Meconium_ileus" id="w">meconium ileus</a>, occurs in 10% of newborns with CF.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> In addition, protrusion of internal <a href="/wiki/Rectum" id="w">rectal</a> membranes (<a href="/wiki/Rectal_prolapse" id="w">rectal prolapse</a>) is more common in CF because of increased fecal volume, malnutrition, and <a href="/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver" id="w">increased intra–abdominal pressure</a> due to coughing.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The thick mucus seen in the lungs has its counterpart in thickened secretions from the pancreas, an organ responsible for providing <a href="/wiki/Pancreatic_juice" id="w">digestive juices</a> which help break down food. These secretions block the movement of the digestive enzymes into the <a href="/wiki/Duodenum" id="w">duodenum</a> and result in irreversible damage to the pancreas, often with painful inflammation (<a href="/wiki/Pancreatitis" id="w">pancreatitis</a>).<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The lack of digestive enzymes leads to difficulty absorbing nutrients with their subsequent excretion in the faeces, a disorder known as <a href="/wiki/Malabsorption" id="w">malabsorption</a>. Malabsorption leads to <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" id="w">malnutrition</a> and poor growth and development because of calorie loss. Individuals with CF also have difficulties absorbing the fat-soluble vitamins <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_A" id="w">A</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_D" id="w">D</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_E" id="w">E</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_K" id="w">K</a>. In addition to the pancreas problems, people with cystic fibrosis experience more <a href="/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease" id="w">heartburn</a>, intestinal blockage by <a href="/wiki/Intussusception_(medical_disorder)" id="w">intussusception</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Constipation" id="w">constipation</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Older individuals with CF may also develop <a href="/wiki/Distal_intestinal_obstruction_syndrome" id="w">distal intestinal obstruction syndrome</a> when thickened faeces cause intestinal blockage.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thickened secretions also may cause liver problems in patients with CF. <a href="/wiki/Bile" id="w">Bile</a> secreted by the liver to aid in digestion may block the <a href="/wiki/Bile_duct" id="w">bile ducts</a>, leading to liver damage.

<p>The pancreas contains the <a href="/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans" id="w">islets of Langerhans</a>, which are responsible for making insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood <a href="/wiki/Glucose" id="w">glucose</a>.

<p>Poor growth is a hallmark of CF. Children with CF typically do not gain weight or height at the same rate as their peers, and occasionally are not diagnosed until investigation is initiated for poor growth. The causes of growth failure are multi&#8211;factorial and include chronic lung infection, poor absorption of nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract, and increased metabolic demand due to chronic illness.</p>
<a id="Infertility" name="Infertility"></a><h3>Infertility</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Infertility" id="w">Infertility</a> affects both men and women. At least 97 percent of men with cystic fibrosis are infertile.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> These men make normal <a href="/wiki/Spermatozoon" id="w">sperm</a> but are missing the tube (<a href="/wiki/Vas_deferens" id="w">vas deferens</a>), which connects the <a href="/wiki/Testicle" id="w">testes</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Ejaculatory_duct" id="w">ejaculatory ducts</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Penis" id="w">penis</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> Many men found to have <a href="/wiki/Congenital_absence_of_the_vas_deferens" id="w">congenital absence of the vas deferens</a> during evaluation for infertility have a mild, previously undiagnosed form of CF.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Some women have fertility difficulties due to thickened cervical mucus or malnutrition.

<a id="Diagnosis_and_monitoring" name="Diagnosis_and_monitoring"></a><h2>Diagnosis and monitoring</h2>
<p>Cystic fibrosis may be diagnosed by <a href="/wiki/Newborn_screening" id="w">newborn screening</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sweat_test" id="w">sweat testing</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Genetic_testing" id="w">genetic testing</a>. As of 2006 in the United States, ten percent of cases are diagnosed shortly after birth as part of newborn screening programs. The newborn screen identifies decreased amounts of the enzyme <a href="/wiki/Trypsin" id="w">trypsin</a>. However, most states and countries do not screen for CF routinely at birth. Therefore, most individuals are diagnosed after symptoms prompt an evaluation for cystic fibrosis. The most commonly-used form of testing is the sweat test. Sweat-testing involves application of a medication that stimulates sweating (<a href="/wiki/Pilocarpine" id="w">pilocarpine</a>) to one <a href="/wiki/Electrode" id="w">electrode</a> of an apparatus and running <a href="/wiki/Electric_current" id="w">electric current</a> to a separate electrode on the skin. This process, called <a href="/wiki/Iontophoresis" id="w">iontophoresis</a>, causes sweating; the sweat is then collected on filter paper or in a capillary tube and analyzed for abnormal amounts of <a href="/wiki/Sodium" id="w">sodium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chloride" id="w">chloride</a>. People with CF have increased amounts of sodium and chloride in their sweat. CF can also be diagnosed by identification of mutations in the CFTR gene.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>A multitude of tests is used to identify complications of CF and to monitor disease progression. <a href="/wiki/Radiology" id="w">X-rays</a> and <a href="/wiki/Computed_tomography" id="w">CAT scans</a> are used to examine the lungs for signs of damage or infection. <a href="/wiki/Sputum_culture" id="w">Examination of the sputum</a> under a <a href="/wiki/Microscope" id="w">microscope</a> is used to identify which bacteria are causing infection so that <a href="/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance" id="w">effective</a> antibiotics can be given. <a href="/wiki/Spirometry" id="w">Pulmonary function tests</a> measure how well the lungs are functioning, and are used to measure the need for and response to antibiotic therapy. <a href="/wiki/Blood_test" id="w">Blood tests</a> can identify liver problems, <a href="/wiki/Avitaminosis" id="w">vitamin deficiencies</a>, and the onset of diabetes. <a href="/wiki/Dual_energy_X-ray_absorptiometry" id="w">DEXA scans</a> can <a href="/wiki/Screening_(medicine)" id="w">screen</a> for osteoporosis and testing for <a href="/wiki/Fecal_elastase" id="w">fecal elastase</a> can help diagnose insufficient digestive enzymes.</p>
<a id="Prenatal_diagnosis" name="Prenatal_diagnosis"></a><h3>Prenatal diagnosis</h3>
<p>Couples who are pregnant or who are planning a pregnancy can themselves be tested for CFTR gene mutations to determine the likelihood that their child will be born with cystic fibrosis. Testing is typically performed first on one or both parents and, if the risk of CF is found to be high, testing on the <a href="/wiki/Fetus" id="w">fetus</a> can then be performed. Cystic fibrosis testing is offered to many couples in the US.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/American_College_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists" id="w">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a> (ACOG) recommends testing for couples who have a personal or close family history.  Additionally, ACOG recommends that carrier testing be offered to all Caucasian couples and be made available to couples of other ethnic backgrounds.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because development of CF in the fetus requires each parent to pass on a mutated copy of the CFTR gene and because CF testing is expensive, testing is often performed on just one parent initially. If that parent is found to be a carrier of a CFTR gene mutation, the other parent is then tested to calculate the risk that their children will have CF. CF can result from more than a thousand different mutations and, as of 2006, it is not possible to test for each one. Testing analyzes the blood for the most common mutations such as ΔF508 &#8212; most commercially-available tests look for 32 or fewer different mutations. If a family has a known uncommon mutation, specific screening for that mutation can be performed. Because not all known mutations are found on current tests, a negative screen does not guarantee that a child will not have CF.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> In addition, because the mutations tested are necessarily those most common in the highest risk groups, testing in lower risk ethnicities is less successful because the mutations commonly seen in these groups are less common in the general population.  These couples may therefore consider testing through labs that offer CF screens with a high number of mutations tested.</p>
<p>Couples who are at high risk for having a child with CF will often opt to perform further testing before or during pregnancy. <a href="/wiki/In_vitro_fertilization" id="w">In vitro fertilization</a> with <a href="/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis" id="w">preimplantation genetic diagnosis</a> offers the possibility to examine the <a href="/wiki/Embryo" id="w">embryo</a> prior to its placement into the uterus. The test, performed 3 days after <a href="/wiki/Fertilization" id="w">fertilization</a>, looks for the presence of abnormal CF genes. If two mutated CFTR genes are identified, the embryo is not used for <a href="/wiki/Embryo_transfer" id="w">embryo transfer</a> and an embryo with at least one normal gene is implanted. </p>
<p>During pregnancy, testing can be performed on the <a href="/wiki/Placenta" id="w">placenta</a> (<a href="/wiki/Chorionic_villus_sampling" id="w">chorionic villus sampling</a>) or the fluid around the fetus (<a href="/wiki/Amniocentesis" id="w">amniocentesis</a>). However, <a href="/wiki/Chorionic_villus_sampling" id="w">chorionic villus sampling</a> has a risk of fetal death of 1 in 100 and amniocentesis of 1 in 200,<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> so the benefits must be determined to outweigh these risks prior to going forward with testing. Alternatively, some couples choose to undergo <a href="/wiki/Third_party_reproduction" id="w">third party reproduction</a> with <a href="/wiki/Egg_donor" id="w">egg</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sperm_donation" id="w">sperm donors</a>.</p>
<a id="Pathophysiology" name="Pathophysiology"></a><h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
<p>Cystic fibrosis occurs when there is a mutation in the CFTR gene. The protein created by this gene is anchored to the <a href="/wiki/Cell_membrane" id="w">outer membrane</a> of <a href="/wiki/Cell_(biology)" id="w">cells</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Sweat_gland" id="w">sweat glands</a>, lung, pancreas, and other affected <a href="/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)" id="w">organs</a>. The protein spans this membrane and acts as a <a href="/wiki/Ion_channel" id="w">channel</a> connecting the inner part of the cell (<a href="/wiki/Cytoplasm" id="w">cytoplasm</a>) to the <a href="/wiki/Extracellular_fluid" id="w">surrounding fluid</a>. This channel is primarily responsible for controlling the movement of chloride from inside to outside of the cell. When the CFTR protein does not work, chloride is trapped inside the cell in the lung and outside in the skin. Because chloride is <a href="/wiki/Electric_charge" id="w">negatively charged</a>, positively charged <a href="/wiki/Ion" id="w">ions</a> also cannot cross into the cell because they are affected by the <a href="/wiki/Electrostatics" id="w">electrical attraction</a> of the chloride ions. Sodium is the most common ion in the extracellular space and the combination of sodium and chloride creates the <a href="/wiki/Sodium_chloride" id="w">salt</a>, which is lost in high amounts in the sweat of individuals with CF. This lost salt forms the basis for the sweat test.<sup id="_ref-Rowe_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rowe" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>How this malfunction of cells in cystic fibrosis causes the clinical manifestations of CF is not well understood. One theory suggests that the lack of chloride exodus through the CFTR protein leads to the accumulation of more viscous, nutrient-rich mucus in the lungs that allows bacteria to hide from the body&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Immune_system" id="w">immune system</a>. Another theory proposes that the CFTR protein failure leads to a paradoxical increase in sodium and chloride uptake, which, by leading to increased water reabsorption, creates dehydrated and thick mucus. Yet another theory focuses on abnormal chloride movement <i>out</i> of the cell, which also leads to dehydration of mucus, pancreatic secretions, biliary secretions, etc. These theories all support the observation that the majority of the damage in CF is due to blockage of the narrow passages of affected organs with thickened secretions. These blockages lead to remodeling and infection in the lung, damage by accumulated digestive enzymes in the pancreas, blockage of the intestines by thick faeces, etc.<sup id="_ref-Rowe_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rowe" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_role_of_chronic_infection_in_lung_disease" name="The_role_of_chronic_infection_in_lung_disease"></a><h3>The role of chronic infection in lung disease</h3>
<p>The lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis are colonized and infected by bacteria from an early age. These bacteria, which often spread amongst individuals with CF, thrive in the altered mucus, which collects in the small airways of the lungs. This mucus encourages the development of bacterial microenvironments (<a href="/wiki/Biofilm" id="w">biofilms</a>) that are difficult for immune cells (and antibiotics) to penetrate. The lungs respond to repeated damage by thick secretions and chronic infections by gradually remodeling the lower airways (<a href="/wiki/Bronchiectasis" id="w">bronchiectasis</a>), making infection even more difficult to eradicate.<sup id="_ref-Saiman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Saiman" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Over time, both the types of bacteria and their individual characteristics change in individuals with CF. In the initial stage, common bacteria such as <i><a href="/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus" id="w">Staphylococcus aureus</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Hemophilus_influenzae" id="w">Hemophilus influenzae</a></i> colonize and infect the lungs. Eventually, however, <i><a href="/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa" id="w">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a></i> (and sometimes <i><a href="/wiki/Burkholderia_cepacia_complex" id="w">Burkholderia cepacia</a></i>) dominates. Once within the lungs, these bacteria adapt to the environment and develop <a href="/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance" id="w">resistance</a> to commonly used antibiotics. <i>Pseudomonas</i> can develop special characteristics that allow the formation of large colonies, known as &#34;mucoid&#34; <i>Pseudomonas</i> and rarely seen in people that do not have CF.<sup id="_ref-Saiman_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Saiman" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>One way in which infection has spread is by passage between different individuals with CF.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> In the past, people with CF often participated in summer &#34;CF Camps&#34; and other recreational gatherings.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Hospitals grouped patients with CF into common areas and routine equipment (such as <a href="/wiki/Nebulizer" id="w">nebulizers</a>)<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> was not sterilized between individual patients.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> This led to transmission of more dangerous strains of bacteria among groups of patients. As a result, individuals with CF are routinely isolated from one another in the healthcare setting and healthcare providers are encouraged to wear gowns and gloves when examining patients with CF in order to limit the spread of virulent bacterial strains.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Often, patients with particularly damaging bacteria will attend clinics on different days and in different buildings than those without these infections.</p>

The most common mutation, <a href="/wiki/ΔF508" id="w">ΔF508</a> is a deletion (Δ) of three nucleotides that results in a loss of the amino acid <a href="/wiki/Phenylalanine" id="w">phenylalanine</a> (F) at the 508th (508) position on the protein. This mutation accounts for seventy percent of CF worldwide and 90 percent of cases in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. There are over 1,400 other mutations that can produce CF, however.

<p>There are several mechanisms by which these mutations cause problems with the CFTR protein. ΔF508, for instance, creates a protein that does not <a href="/wiki/Protein_folding" id="w">fold</a> normally and is degraded by the cell. Several mutations, which are common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, result in proteins that are too short because <a href="/wiki/Translation_(genetics)" id="w">production</a> is ended prematurely. Less common mutations produce proteins that do not use energy normally, do not allow chloride to cross the membrane appropriately, or are degraded at a faster rate than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced.<sup id="_ref-Rowe_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rowe" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

The most consistent aspect of therapy in cystic fibrosis is limiting and treating the lung damage caused by thick mucus and infection with the goal of maintaining <a href="/wiki/Quality_of_life" id="w">quality of life</a>. <a href="/wiki/Intravenous_therapy" id="w">Intravenous</a>, <a href="/wiki/Inhalation" id="w">inhaled</a>, and oral antibiotics are used to treat chronic and acute infections. Mechanical devices and inhalation medications are used to alter and clear the thickened mucus. Other aspects of CF therapy involve treatment of diabetes with insulin, pancreatic disease with enzyme replacement, and infertility with advanced reproductive techniques. In addition, therapies such as <a href="/wiki/Organ_transplant" id="w">transplantation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gene_therapy" id="w">gene therapy</a> aim to cure some of the effects of cystic fibrosis.</p>
<a id="Antibiotics_to_treat_lung_disease" name="Antibiotics_to_treat_lung_disease"></a><h3>Antibiotics to treat lung disease</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Antibiotics" id="w">Antibiotics</a> are given whenever pneumonia is suspected or there has been a decline in lung function. Antibiotics are often chosen based on information about prior infections. Many bacteria common in cystic fibrosis are resistant to multiple antibiotics and require weeks of treatment with intravenous antibiotics such as <a href="/wiki/Vancomycin" id="w">vancomycin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tobramycin" id="w">tobramycin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Meropenem" id="w">meropenem</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ciprofloxacin" id="w">ciprofloxacin</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Piperacillin" id="w">piperacillin</a>. This prolonged therapy often necessitates hospitalization and insertion of a more permanent <a href="/wiki/Intravenous_therapy#Peripheral IV lines" id="w">IV</a> such as a <a href="/wiki/Peripherally-inserted_central_catheter" id="w">PICC line</a> or <a href="/wiki/Port-a-Cath" id="w">Port-a-Cath</a>. Inhaled therapy with antibiotics such as tobramycin and <a href="/wiki/Colistin" id="w">colistin</a> is often given for months at a time in order to improve lung function by impeding the growth of colonized bacteria.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> Oral antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin or <a href="/wiki/Azithromycin" id="w">azithromycin</a> are sometimes given to help prevent infection or to control ongoing infection.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> Some individuals spend years between hospitalizations for antibiotics, whereas others require several antibiotic treatments each year.</p>
<p>Several common antibiotics such as tobramycin and vancomycin can cause <a href="/wiki/Ototoxicity" id="w">hearing loss</a> or <a href="/wiki/Renal_failure" id="w">kidney problems</a> with long-term use.

<a id="Other_methods_to_treat_lung_disease" name="Other_methods_to_treat_lung_disease"></a><h3>Other methods to treat lung disease</h3>
<p>Several mechanical techniques are used to dislodge sputum and encourage its expectoration. In the hospital setting, physical therapy is utilized; a therapist pounds an individual&#39;s chest with his or her hands several times a day. Devices that recreate this percussive therapy include the <a href="/wiki/ThAIRapy_Vest" id="w">ThAIRapy Vest</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Intrapulmonary_percussive_ventilator" id="w">intrapulmonary percussive ventilator</a> (IPV). Newer methods such as <a href="/wiki/Biphasic_Cuirass_Ventilation" id="w">Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation</a>, and associated clearance mode available in such devices, now integrate a cough assistance phase, as well as a vibration phase for dislodging secretions. <a href="/wiki/Biphasic_Cuirass_Ventilation" id="w">Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation</a> is also shown to provide a bridge to transplantation.

Newborns with meconium ileus typically require surgery, whereas adults with <a href="/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location#Proximal and distal" id="w">distal</a> intestinal obstruction syndrome typically do not. Treatment of pancreatic insufficiency by replacement of missing digestive enzymes allows the duodenum to properly absorb nutrients and vitamins that would otherwise be lost in the faeces. Even so, most individuals with CF take additional amounts of vitamins <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_A" id="w">A</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_D" id="w">D</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_E" id="w">E</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_K" id="w">K</a> and eat high-calorie meals. It should be noted, however, that nutritional advice given to patients is, at best, mixed: Often, literature encourages the eating of high-fat foods without differentiating between <a href="/wiki/Saturated_fat" id="w">saturated</a> and <a href="/wiki/Unsaturated_fat" id="w">unsaturated fats</a>/<a href="/wiki/Trans_fat" id="w">trans-fats</a>; this lack of clear information runs counter to health advice given to the general population, and creates the risk of further serious health problems for people with cystic fibrosis as they grow older. So far, no large-scale research involving the incidence of <a href="/wiki/Atherosclerosis" id="w">atherosclerosis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coronary_heart_disease" id="w">coronary heart disease</a> in adults with cystic fibrosis has been conducted.</p>

<a id="Transplantation_and_gene_therapy" name="Transplantation_and_gene_therapy"></a><h3>Transplantation and gene therapy</h3>

<p><a href="/wiki/Lung_transplantation" id="w">Lung transplantation</a> often becomes necessary for individuals with cystic fibrosis as lung function and <a href="/wiki/Exercise_intolerance" id="w">exercise tolerance</a> declines. Although single lung transplantation is possible in other diseases, individuals with CF must have both lungs replaced because the remaining lung would contain bacteria that could infect the transplanted lung. A pancreatic or liver transplant may be performed at the same time in order to alleviate liver disease and/or diabetes.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> Lung transplantation is considered when lung function approaches a point where it threatens survival or requires assistance from mechanical devices.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Gene_therapy" id="w">Gene therapy</a> holds promise as a potential avenue to cure cystic fibrosis. Gene therapy attempts to place a normal copy of the CFTR gene into affected cells.

<div class="thumbcaption">Cystic Fibrosis has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.</div></p>
<p>Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disease among people of <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">European</a> heritage. In the United States, approximately 30,000 individuals have CF; most are diagnosed by six months of age. <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> has approximately 3,000 citizens with CF. Approximately 1 in 25 people of European descent and 1 in 29 people of <a href="/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews" id="w">Ashkenazi Jewish</a> descent is a carrier of a cystic fibrosis mutation. Although CF is less common in these groups, approximately 1 in 46 <a href="/wiki/Hispanic" id="w">Hispanics</a>, 1 in 65 <a href="/wiki/Africa#Demographics" id="w">Africans</a> and 1 in 90 <a href="/wiki/Asian_people" id="w">Asians</a> carry at least one abnormal CFTR gene.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li>Cholera: With the discovery that <a href="/wiki/Cholera" id="w">cholera</a> <a href="/wiki/Toxin" id="w">toxin</a> requires normal host CFTR proteins to function properly, it was hypothesized that carriers of mutant CFTR genes benefited from resistance to cholera and other causes of diarrhea.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> Further studies have not confirmed this hypothesis.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> </li>

<li>Diarrhoea: It has also been hypothesized that the prevalence of CF in Europe might be connected with the development of cattle domestication.

<a id="Public_Awareness" name="Public_Awareness"></a><h3>Public Awareness</h3>
<p>Some children with cystic fibrosis in the United States call their disease <i>65 Roses</i> because the words are easier to pronounce. This trademarked phrase has been popularized by the <a href="/wiki/Cystic_Fibrosis_Foundation" id="w">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</a>. The phrase came into being when it was used by a young boy who had overheard his mother, a volunteer for the Foundation, speaking of his illness. He later informed her that he knew she was working to help with &#34;sixty-five roses&#34;<sup id="_ref-65roses_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65roses" title="">[68]</a></sup> The term has since been used as a symbol by organizations and families of cystic fibrosis victims.</p>
<p>The fight against cystic fibrosis has been a news story in <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, where on <a href="/wiki/April_30" id="w">April 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, the rising pop singer <a href="/wiki/Gr%C3%A9gory_Lemarchal" id="w">Grégory Lemarchal</a> died from the illness at the age of 23. Grégory won the fourth round of <a href="/wiki/Star_Academy" id="w">Star Academy</a> (equivalent of Pop Idol) in 2004 with an unmatched voting score of 80% at the grand final - a percentage unmatched in the history of the show
(the runner-up, Lucie Silvas, only received 20% of votes).  On <a href="/wiki/May_4" id="w">May 4</a>, a special television programme was broadcast on <a href="/wiki/TF1" id="w">TF1</a> to commemorate his life, and its 10.5 million viewers were asked to donate money to help progress research into finding a cure.  More than 7.5 million euros have been raised.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> Following his death, his family started <a href="/wiki/Association_Gr%C3%A9gory_Lemarchal" id="w">Association Grégory Lemarchal</a>, an advocacy organization supporting people with cystic fibrosis.</p>
