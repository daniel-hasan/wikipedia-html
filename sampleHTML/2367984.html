<p><b><i>Absolute Beginners</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/1986" id="w">1986</a> slick <a href="/wiki/Mod_(lifestyle)" id="w">mod</a>-stylish <a href="/wiki/Rock_musical" id="w">rock musical</a> movie adapted from <a href="/wiki/Colin_MacInnes" id="w">Colin MacInnes</a> book <i><a href="/wiki/Absolute_Beginners" id="w">Absolute Beginners</a></i> about life in late 1950s <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>. The film was directed by <a href="/wiki/Julien_Temple" id="w">Julien Temple</a> and features roles by <a href="/wiki/David_Bowie" id="w">David Bowie</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sade_Adu" id="w">Sade</a>. Also a breakout role for <a href="/wiki/Patsy_Kensit" id="w">Patsy Kensit</a>, later known for her marriage to <a href="/wiki/Liam_Gallagher" id="w">Liam Gallagher</a>.</p>
<p>At the time <i>Absolute Beginners</i> was released, it received immense coverage in the British media. At the time, the British film industry was perceived as being on the point of collapse (with the recent failure of the film <i><a href="/wiki/Revolution_(film)" id="w">Revolution</a></i>).  </p>
<p><i>Absolute Beginners</i> was panned by critics and became a box office flop. Some of the criticisms included stylistic anachronisms, such as the mini-skirt and decidedly 1980s music from the likes of the <a href="/wiki/Style_Council" id="w">Style Council</a> and Sade, the <a href="/wiki/Bowdlerisation" id="w">bowdlerisation</a> of Kensit&#39;s character (Crepe Suzette had been depicted as a promiscuous negrophile in the book), and the casting of Bowie, who made it a condition of his musical contribution. </p>
<p>It has subsequently gained status as a cult movie, in part due to its soundtrack. Some people compare the movie as the British equivalent of <i><a href="/wiki/Streets_of_Fire" id="w">Streets of Fire</a></i>, a <a href="/wiki/1984" id="w">1984</a> American movie that was a retro-stylized rock movie with a notable soundtrack, also a commercial failure. </p>
<p>The commercial failure of <i>Absolute Beginners</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Mission_(film)" id="w">The Mission</a></i> led to the collapse of <a href="/wiki/Goldcrest_Films" id="w">Goldcrest</a>, a major British film studio.</p>
