<a id="Operation_RYAN" name="Operation_RYAN"></a><h2>Operation RYAN</h2>
<p>The greatest catalyst to the Able Archer war scare occurred more than two years earlier. In a May 1981 closed-session meeting of senior <a href="/wiki/KGB" id="w">KGB</a> officers and <a href="/wiki/Soviet" id="w">Soviet</a> leaders, <a href="/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" id="w">General Secretary</a> <a href="/wiki/Leonid_Brezhnev" id="w">Leonid Brezhnev</a> and KGB chairman <a href="/wiki/Yuri_Andropov" id="w">Yuri Andropov</a> bluntly announced that the United States was preparing a secret nuclear attack on the USSR. To combat this threat, Andropov announced, the KGB and <a href="/wiki/GRU" id="w">GRU</a> would begin <a href="/wiki/VRYAN" id="w">Operation RYAN</a>. RYAN (РЯН) was a Russian <a href="/wiki/Acronym" id="w">acronym</a> for &#34;Nuclear Missile Attack&#34; (Ракетное Ядерное Нападение); Operation RYAN was the largest, most comprehensive peacetime <a href="/wiki/Intelligence_(information_gathering)" id="w">intelligence</a>-gathering operation in Soviet history. Agents abroad were charged with monitoring the figures who would decide to launch a nuclear attack, the service and technical personnel who would implement the attack, and the facilities from which the attack would originate. In all probability, the unlikely-sounding goal of Operation RYAN was to discover the first <i>intent</i> of a nuclear attack and then prevent it.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Fischer Conundrum RYANII_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fischer Conundrum RYANII" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The impetus for the implementation of Operation RYAN is still largely unknown. <a href="/wiki/Oleg_Gordievsky" id="w">Oleg Gordievsky</a>, the highest-ranking KGB official ever to <a href="/wiki/Defection" id="w">defect</a>, suspected that it was born of the increased &#34;Soviet Paranoia&#34; coupled with &#34;<a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" id="w">Reaganite</a> Rhetoric&#34;. Gordievsky conjectured that Brezhnev and Andropov, who &#34;were very, very old-fashioned and easily influenced… by Communist dogmas,&#34; truly believed that an antagonistic Reagan would push the nuclear button and relegate the Soviet Union to the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Ash_heap_of_history" id="w">ash heap of history</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Fischer Conundrum KGB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fischer Conundrum KGB" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Gordievsky_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gordievsky" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Reagan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reagan" title="">[14]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" id="w">CIA</a> historian <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_B._Fischer" id="w">Benjamin B.

In contrast to the extremely secretive PSYOPs against the Soviet Union, the Soviet attack on the <a href="/wiki/Korean_Air" id="w">Korean civilian airliner</a> <a href="/wiki/Korean_Air_Flight_007" id="w">Korean Air Flight 007</a> (KAL 007), on <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a>, brought relations between the two <a href="/wiki/Superpower" id="w">superpowers</a> to a new public low. Illustrating the historically antagonistic relations between the USA and USSR in the early 1980s, the Soviet attack on KAL 007 also lends several insights into Able Archer 83. The Soviet Union, perhaps due to PSYOP penetrations, strongly guarded its territorial airspace. The disaster demonstrated the hair-trigger mindset held by many in the Soviet Union. Reagan assessed in his memoirs, &#34;If, as some people speculated, the Soviet pilots simply mistook the airliner for a military plane, what kind of imagination did it take to think of a Soviet military man with his finger close to a nuclear <a href="/wiki/Push-button" id="w">push-button</a> making an even more tragic mistake?&#34;<sup id="_ref-Fischer Conundrum KAL_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fischer Conundrum KAL" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Reagan Life 548_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reagan Life 548" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>The flightpath of KAL 007 sent the Boeing 747 aircraft over the northern Pacific Ocean area toward the proximal area of the Soviet Union&#39;s southern border with the Pacific.  In that general area, a highly sensitive Soviet nuclear air-base was located at Sakhalin.</p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_23" id="w">March 23</a> <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a>, Reagan proposed the <a href="/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative" id="w">Strategic Defense Initiative</a>, labeled by the media and critics as &#34;Star Wars&#34;. While Reagan viewed the initiative as a safety net against nuclear war, leaders in the Soviet Union viewed it as a definitive departure from the relative weapons parity of <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A9tente" id="w">détente</a> and an <a href="/wiki/Militarisation_of_space" id="w">escalation of the arms race into space</a>. Andropov &#8211; who had become General Secretary following Brezhnev&#39;s death in November 1982 &#8211; lambasted Reagan for &#34;inventing new plans on how to unleash a nuclear war in the best way, with the hope of winning it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Fischer Conundrum Star_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fischer Conundrum Star" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The US Pershing II Missile</div>
Despite the enormous Soviet outcry over the &#34;Star Wars&#34; program, the weapons plan that generated the most alarm among the Soviet Union&#39;s leadership during Able Archer 83 was the 1979 NATO approval and subsequent deployment of intermediate-range <a href="/wiki/Pershing_missile" id="w">Pershing II</a> missiles in <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe" id="w">Western Europe</a>. These missiles, deployed to counter Soviet <a href="/wiki/RSD-10_Pioneer" id="w">SS-20</a> intermediate-range missiles on its own western border, represented a major threat to the Soviets. The Pershing II was capable of destroying Soviet &#34;hard targets&#34; such as underground <a href="/wiki/Missile_silo" id="w">missile silos</a> and command and control <a href="/wiki/Bunker" id="w">bunkers</a>. The missiles could be emplaced and launched from any surveyed site in minutes, and because the guidance system was self-correcting, the missile system possessed a genuine &#34;<a href="/wiki/First_strike" id="w">first strike</a> capability&#34;.  Furthermore, it was estimated that the missiles (deployed in <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" id="w">West Germany</a>) could reach targets in the western Soviet Union within four to six minutes of their launch. These capabilities led Soviet leaders to believe that the only way to survive a Pershing II strike was to <a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war" id="w">preempt</a> it. This fear of an undetected Pershing II attack, according to CIA historian Benjamin B. Fischer, was explicitly linked to the mandate of Operation RYAN: to detect a decision by the United States to launch a nuclear attack and (it must be believed) to preempt it.<sup id="_ref-Fischer Conundrum RYANII_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fischer Conundrum RYANII" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-White 1983 25-9_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-White 1983 25-9" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Exercise_Able_Archer_83" name="Exercise_Able_Archer_83"></a><h1>Exercise Able Archer 83</h1>
<p>Thus, on <a href="/wiki/November_2" id="w">November 2</a> <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a>, as Soviet intelligence services were attempting to detect the signs of a nuclear strike, NATO began to simulate one. The exercise, codenamed Able Archer, involved numerous NATO allies and simulated NATO&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Command_and_Control" id="w">Command, Control, and Communications</a> (C³) procedures during a nuclear war. It probably emulated <a href="/wiki/The_Pentagon" id="w">the Pentagon</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Single_Integrated_Operational_Plan" id="w">Single Integrated Operational Plan</a> (SIOP) which, at the time, named 25,000 military targets, 15,000 industrial targets, and 500 targets associated with Soviet leadership. Some Soviet leadership, because of the preceding world events and the exercise&#39;s particularly realistic nature, believed — in accordance with Soviet military doctrine — that the exercise may have been a cover for an actual attack.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Fischer Conundrum Archer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fischer Conundrum Archer" title="">[22]</a></sup> Indeed, a KGB telegram of <a href="/wiki/February_17" id="w">February 17</a> described one likely scenario as such:</p>
<p>{{Cquote}}</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/February_17" id="w">February 17</a> <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a> KGB Permanent Operational Assignment assigned its agents to monitor several possible indicators of a nuclear attack. These included actions by &#34;A cadre of people associated with preparing and implementing decision about RYAN, and also a group of people, including service and technical personnel… those working in the operating services of installations connected with processing and implementing the decision about RYAN, and communication staff involved in the operation and interaction of these installations.&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because Able Archer 83 simulated an actual release, it is likely that the service and technical personnel mentioned in the memo were active in the exercise. More conspicuously, British Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" id="w">Margaret Thatcher</a> and West German Chancellor <a href="/wiki/Helmut_Kohl" id="w">Helmut Kohl</a> participated (though not concurrently) in the nuclear drill. United States President Reagan, Vice President <a href="/wiki/George_H._W._Bush" id="w">George H. W. Bush</a>, and Secretary of Defense <a href="/wiki/Caspar_Weinberger" id="w">Caspar Weinberger</a> were also intended to participate. <a href="/wiki/Robert_McFarlane" id="w">Robert McFarlane</a>, who had assumed the position of <a href="/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)" id="w">National Security Advisor</a> just two weeks earlier, realized the implications of such participation early in the exercise&#39;s planning and rejected it.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>    
<p>Another illusory indicator likely noticed by Soviet analysts was an influx of <a href="/wiki/Encryption" id="w">ciphered</a> communications between the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> and the United States. Soviet intelligence was informed that &#34;so-called nuclear consultations in NATO are probably one of the stages of immediate preparation by the adversary for RYAN.&#34;<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> To the Soviet analysts, this burst of secret communications between the United States and the UK one month before the beginning of Able Archer may have appeared to be this &#34;consultation&#34;. In reality, the burst of communication regarded the US <a href="/wiki/Invasion_of_Grenada" id="w">invasion of Grenada</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a>, which caused a great deal of diplomatic traffic as the sovereign of the island was <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Elizabeth II</a>.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>A further startling aspect reported by KGB agents regarded the NATO communications used during the exercise. According to the <a href="/wiki/Moscow" id="w">Moscow</a> Centre&#39;s <a href="/wiki/February_17" id="w">February 17</a> <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a> memo,</p>
<p>{{Cquote}}</p>
<p>Soviet Intelligence appeared to substantiate these suspicions by reporting that NATO was indeed using unique, never-before-seen procedures as well as message formats more sophisticated than previous exercises that possibly indicated the proximity of nuclear attack.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, during Able Archer 83 NATO forces simulated a move through all alert phases, from <a href="/wiki/DEFCON" id="w">DEFCON 5</a> to DEFCON 1. While these phases were simulated, alarmist KGB agents mistakenly reported them as actual. According to Soviet intelligence, NATO doctrine stated, &#34;<i>Operational readiness No 1</i> is declared when there are obvious indications of preparation to begin military operations.  It is considered that war is inevitable and may start at any moment.&#34;<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Soviet <a href="/wiki/SS-20" id="w">SS-20</a> missile</div>
Upon learning that US nuclear activity mirrored its hypothesized first strike activity, the Moscow Centre sent its residencies a flash <a href="/wiki/Telegram" id="w">telegram</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_8" id="w">November 8</a> or 9 (Oleg Gordievsky cannot recall which), incorrectly reporting an alert on American bases and frantically asking for further information regarding an American first strike. The alert precisely coincided with the seven- to ten-day period estimated between NATO&#39;s preliminary decision and an actual strike.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> This was the peak of the war scare.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, believing its only chance of surviving a NATO strike was to preempt it, readied its nuclear arsenal. The CIA reported activity in the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Military_District" id="w">Baltic Military District</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia" id="w">Czechoslovakia</a>, and it determined that nuclear capable aircraft in Poland and East Germany were placed &#34;on high alert status with readying of nuclear strike forces&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Pry Scare 43-4_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pry Scare 43-4" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Former CIA analyst Peter Vincent Pry goes further, saying he suspects that the aircraft were merely the tip of the iceberg. He hypothesizes that — in accordance with Soviet military procedure and history — <a href="/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile" id="w">ICBM</a> silos, easily readied and difficult for the United States to detect, were also prepared for a launch.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Soviet fears of the attack ended as the Able Archer exercise finished on <a href="/wiki/November_11" id="w">November 11</a>.

<a id="American_reaction" name="American_reaction"></a><h1>American reaction</h1>

<p>A still-<a href="/wiki/Classified_information" id="w">classified</a> report written by Nina Stewart for the President&#39;s Foreign Advisory Board concurs with Gates and refutes the previous CIA reports, concluding that further analysis shows that the Soviets were, in fact, genuinely fearful of US aggression.<sup id="_ref-Oberdorfer Era 67_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oberdorfer Era 67" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some historians, including Beth B. Fischer in her book <i>The Reagan Reversal</i>, pin Able Archer 83 as profoundly affecting President Reagan and his turn from a policy of confrontation towards the Soviet Union to a policy of <a href="/wiki/Rapprochement" id="w">rapprochement</a>. Most other historians say that Reagan always intended to increase the United States defensive ability and then negotiate with the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> from a position of strength. The thoughts of Reagan and those around him provide important insight upon the nuclear scare and its subsequent ripples. On <a href="/wiki/October_10" id="w">October 10</a> <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a>, just over a month before Able Archer 83, President Reagan screened a television film about <a href="/wiki/Lawrence%2C_Kansas" id="w">Lawrence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kansas" id="w">Kansas</a> being destroyed by a nuclear attack entitled <i><a href="/wiki/The_Day_After" id="w">The Day After</a></i>.

<p>Later in October, Reagan attended a Pentagon briefing on nuclear war. During his first two years in office, he had refused to take part in such briefings, feeling it irreverent to rehearse a nuclear apocalypse; finally, he consented to the Pentagon official requests. According to officials present, the briefing &#34;chastened&#34; Reagan. Weinberg said, &#34;[Reagan] had a very deep revulsion to the whole idea of nuclear weapons…  These war games brought home to anybody the fantastically horrible events that would surround such a scenario.&#34;  Reagan described the briefing in his own words: &#34;A most sobering experience with <a href="/wiki/Caspar_Weinberger" id="w">Cap W</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_William_Vessey_Jr." id="w">Gen. Vessey</a> in the <a href="/wiki/White_House_Situation_Room" id="w">Situation room</a>, a briefing on our complete plan in the event of a nuclear attack.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Reagan Life 585_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reagan Life 585" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>These two glimpses of nuclear war primed Reagan for Able Archer 83, giving him a very specific picture of what would occur had the situation further developed. After receiving intelligence reports from sources including Gordievsky, it was clear that the Soviets were unnerved. While officials were concerned with the Soviet panic, they were hesitant about believing the proximity of a Soviet attack. <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State" id="w">Secretary of State</a> <a href="/wiki/George_P._Shultz" id="w">George P. Shultz</a> thought it &#34;incredible, at least to us&#34; that the Soviets would believe the US would launch a genuine attack.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> In general, Reagan did not share the secretary&#39;s belief that cooler heads would prevail, writing:</p>

<p>Able Archer 83 was the last nuclear scare of the Cold War. By 1983 the United States, under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" id="w">Ronald Reagan</a>, was in the middle of a massive arms build up, one which would last throughout the mid and later half of the 1980s. United States policies of the 1980s, such as the <a href="/wiki/600-ship_Navy" id="w">600-ship Navy</a>, drove home the US desire to continue opposition to the Soviet Union by any means necessary.
