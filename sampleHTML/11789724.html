<p><b>Absinthe</b> (also <b>absinth, absynthe, absenta</b>) (English: {{IPAEng}}; French: {{IPA2}}) is a <a href="/wiki/Distillation" id="w">distilled</a>, highly <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" id="w">alcoholic</a> (usually 45 to 93 percent) <a href="/wiki/Anise" id="w">anise</a>-<a href="/wiki/Flavored_liquor" id="w">flavored spirit</a> derived from <a href="/wiki/Herb" id="w">herbs</a> including the flowers and leaves of the medicinal plant <i><a href="/wiki/Absinth_Wormwood" id="w">Artemisia absinthium</a></i>, also called <i>Grand Wormwood</i> or <i>Absinth Wormwood</i>. Absinthe is typically green (either naturally or with added color) or clear and is often referred to as <i>la Fée Verte</i> (&#39;The Green <a href="/wiki/Fairy" id="w">Fairy</a>&#39;). Although it is sometimes mistakenly called a <a href="/wiki/Liqueur" id="w">liqueur</a>, absinthe is not bottled with added <a href="/wiki/Sugar" id="w">sugar</a> and is therefore classified as a <a href="/wiki/Distilled_beverage" id="w">liquor</a> or spirit.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Absinthe is uncommon among spirits in that it is bottled at a high proof but consumed diluted with water to the strength of wine (see Drink Preparation/Ritual). </p>
<p>Absinthe originated in <a href="/wiki/Val-de-Travers" id="w">Val-de-Travers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>, as an <a href="/wiki/Elixir" id="w">elixir</a>/<a href="/wiki/Tincture" id="w">tincture</a>. However, it is better known for its popularity in late 19th- and early 20th-century <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, particularly among <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Parisian</a> artists and writers whose romantic associations with the drink still linger in popular culture. At the end of the 19th century over 2 million liters<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> of absinthe were consumed annually in France alone; by 1910 this number grew to 36 million.<sup id="_ref-abfaq3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abfaq3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Further, absinthe was portrayed as a dangerously <a href="/wiki/Addiction" id="w">addictive</a>, <a href="/wiki/Psychedelics%2C_dissociatives_and_deliriants" id="w">psychoactive</a> drug; the chemical <a href="/wiki/Thujone" id="w">thujone</a> was blamed for most of its deleterious effects. The <a href="/wiki/Jean_Lanfray" id="w">Lanfray murders</a> of 1906 provoked a petition to the <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Swiss</a> government leading to its prohibition in <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>, and subsequently other countries. By 1915, it was prohibited in a number of European countries and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. </p>
<p>Though it was vilified, no evidence shows it to be any more dangerous or psychoactive than ordinary alcohol.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> A modern absinthe revival began in the 1990s, as countries in the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" id="w">European Union</a> began to reauthorize its manufacture and sale.

<a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h1>Etymology</h1>
<p>{{wiktionarypar}}
The French word <i>absinthe</i> can refer either to the alcoholic beverage or to the actual wormwood plant (<i>grande absinthe</i> being <i><a href="/wiki/Absinth_Wormwood" id="w">Artemisia absinthium</a></i>, and <i>petite absinthe</i> being <i><a href="/wiki/Artemisia_pontica" id="w">Artemisia pontica</a></i>). The word derives from the <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> <i>absinthium</i>, which is in turn a stylization of the <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> <b>αψίνθιον</b> (apsínthion), wormwood. Some claim that the word means &#34;undrinkable&#34; in Greek.{{Fact}}, but it may instead be linked to the <a href="/wiki/Persian_language" id="w">Persian</a> root <i>spand</i> or <i>aspand</i>, or the variant <i>esfand</i>, which would have meant <i><a href="/wiki/Harmal" id="w">Peganum harmala</a></i>, also called Syrian Rue though not an actual variety of <a href="/wiki/Rue" id="w">rue</a>, another famously bitter herb. That this particular plant was commonly burned as a protective offering may suggest that its origins lie in the reconstructed <a href="/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language" id="w">Proto-Indo-European</a> root <i>*spend</i>, meaning &#34;to perform a ritual&#34; or &#34;make an offering.&#34; Whether the word was a borrowing from Persian into Greek, or rather from a common ancestor, is unclear.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#34;Absinth&#34; (without the &#34;e&#34;) is a spelling variation of absinthe that is often seen in <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe" id="w">central Europe</a>. Because many Bohemian-style products use this spelling{{Fact}}, it is often thought to be synonymous with Bohemian absinthe, but such is not always the case.</p>

Traditionally, absinthe is poured into a glass over which a specially designed <a href="/wiki/Slotted_spoon" id="w">slotted spoon</a> is placed. A sugar cube is then deposited in the bowl of the spoon.  Ice-cold water is poured or dripped over the sugar until the drink is diluted to between a 3:1-to-5:1 ratio. During this process, the components that are not soluble in water, mainly those from <a href="/wiki/Anise" id="w">anise</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fennel" id="w">fennel</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Star_anise" id="w">star anise</a>, come out of solution and cloud the drink. The resulting milky <a href="/wiki/Opalescence" id="w">opalescence</a> is called the <i>louche</i> (<i>Fr.</i> &#34;opaque&#34; or &#34;shady&#34;, IPA [luʃ]). The addition of water is important, causing the herbs to &#34;blossom&#34; and bringing out many of the flavors originally overpowered by the anise.  </p>
<p>Originally a waiter would serve a dose of absinthe, ice water in a <a href="/wiki/Carafe" id="w">carafe</a>, and sugar separately, and the drinker would prepare it to his preference{{Fact}}. With increased popularity, the absinthe fountain, a large jar of ice water on a base with spigots, came into use. It allowed a number of drinks to be prepared at once, and with a hands-free drip, patrons were able to socialize while louching a glass.</p>
<p>Although many bars served absinthe in standard glasses, a number of glasses were specifically made for absinthe. These had a dose line, bulge, or bubble in the lower portion denoting how much absinthe should be poured in. One &#34;dose&#34; of absinthe is around 1 ounce (30 ml), and most glasses used this as the standard, with some drinkers using as much as 1 1/2 ounces (45 ml).</p>
<p>In addition to being drunk with water poured over sugar, absinthe was a common cocktail ingredient in both Great Britain and the United States,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> and continues to be a popular ingredient today. One of the most famous of these is Ernest Hemingway&#39;s &#34;Death in the Afternoon&#34; cocktail, a concoction he contributed to a 1935 collection of celebrity recipes. His directions are as follows: &#34;Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness.  Drink three to five of these slowly.&#34;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

The main herbs used to produce absinthe are green <a href="/wiki/Anise" id="w">anise</a>, florence <a href="/wiki/Fennel" id="w">fennel</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Absinth_Wormwood" id="w">grande wormwood</a>, often called the &#34;holy trinity.&#34;{{Fact}} Many other herbs may be used as well, such as <a href="/wiki/Hyssop" id="w">hyssop</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lemon_balm" id="w">melissa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Star_anise" id="w">star anise</a>, petite wormwood (<i>Artemisia pontica</i> or Roman wormwood), <a href="/wiki/Angelica" id="w">angelica</a> root, <a href="/wiki/Sweet_Flag" id="w">Sweet Flag</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dittany" id="w">dittany</a> leaves, <a href="/wiki/Coriander" id="w">coriander</a>, <a href="/wiki/Veronica_(plant)" id="w">veronica</a>, <a href="/wiki/Juniper" id="w">juniper</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nutmeg" id="w">nutmeg</a>, and various mountain herbs.</p>
<p>The simple <a href="/wiki/Maceration_(wine)" id="w">maceration</a> of wormwood in alcohol (as called for in absinthe kits) without distillation produces an extremely bitter drink because of the presence of the water-soluble <a href="/wiki/Absinthin" id="w">absinthin</a>, one of the most bitter substances known to man. Authentic recipes call for <a href="/wiki/Distillation" id="w">distillation</a> after a primary maceration and before the optional secondary coloring maceration. The distillation of wormwood, anise, and Florence fennel first produces a colorless distillate that leaves the <a href="/wiki/Alembic" id="w">alembic</a> at around 72 percent <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" id="w">alcohol</a> by volume (144 proof). </p>
<p>The distillate can be bottled clear, to produce a <i>Blanche</i> or <i>la Bleue</i> absinthe, or it can be colored using artificial or natural coloring. Traditionally the natural coloring step is done by <a href="/wiki/Steeping" id="w">steeping</a> petite wormwood, <a href="/wiki/Hyssop" id="w">hyssop</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Melissa_(plant)" id="w">melissa</a>, among other herbs, in the liquid. <a href="/wiki/Chlorophyll" id="w">Chlorophyll</a> from these herbs gives the drink its famous green color, and this type of absinthe is known as a <i>verte</i>.  After the coloring process, the resulting product is reduced with water to the desired percentage of alcohol. </p>
<p>In at least one documented case, absinthe can be naturally colored red with a red flower or herb and called a <i>rouge</i> or <i>rose</i> absinthe. Since the color is achieved by steeping herbs, it is theoretically possible to create a &#39;naturally colored&#39; absinthe of any color by using the correct plant material, although only one historical rouge brand has been discovered thus far<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Absinthe can also be produced by mixing steam-distilled oils in high-proof alcohol, called an oil-mix.</p>
<p>Historically, most absinthes contain between 60 and 75 percent <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" id="w">alcohol</a> by volume (120 to 150 proof). It is said to improve materially with storage, and many pre-ban distilleries aged their absinthe in neutral barrels before bottling. In the late 19th century, cheap brands of absinthe were occasionally <a href="/wiki/Adulterant" id="w">adulterated</a> by profiteers with <a href="/wiki/Copper" id="w">copper</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zinc" id="w">zinc</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indigo_plant" id="w">indigo plant</a>, or other <a href="/wiki/Dye" id="w">dyes</a> to impart the green color, and with <a href="/wiki/Antimony_trichloride" id="w">antimony trichloride</a> to produce or enhance the <i>louche</i> effect. {{Fact}} It is also thought that the use of cheaper industrial alcohol and poor distillation technique by the manufacturers of cheaper brands resulted in contamination with <a href="/wiki/Methanol" id="w">methanol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fusel_alcohol" id="w">fusel alcohol</a>, and similar unwanted distillates. {{Fact}} This addition of toxic chemicals is likely to have contributed to absinthe&#39;s reputation as a hallucination-inducing or otherwise harmful beverage.</p>
<a id="Absinthe_kits" name="Absinthe_kits"></a><h2>Absinthe kits</h2>
<p>There are numerous recipes for homemade absinthe on the Internet, many of which center around soaking or mixing a kit or store-bought herbs and wormwood extract with high-proof liquor such as <a href="/wiki/Vodka" id="w">vodka</a> or <a href="/wiki/Everclear_(alcohol)" id="w">Everclear</a>. Even though these do-it-yourself kits have gained in popularity, it is simply not possible to produce absinthe without distillation.</p>
<p>Besides being unpleasant to drink<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> and not authentic distilled absinthe, these homemade concoctions do contain thujone and can sometimes be poisonous, especially when using wormwood extract.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Many of these recipes call for the use of liberal amounts of wormwood extract or essence of wormwood in the hopes of increasing the believed <a href="/wiki/Hallucinogen" id="w">psychoactive</a> effects. Consuming essential oils will not only fail to produce a high, but can be very dangerous. Wormwood extract can cause <a href="/wiki/Renal_failure" id="w">renal failure</a> and death from excessive amounts of <a href="/wiki/Thujone" id="w">thujone</a>, which in large quantities acts as a <a href="/wiki/Seizure" id="w">convulsive</a> <a href="/wiki/Neurotoxin" id="w">neurotoxin</a>. Essential oil of wormwood should never be consumed straight.</p>
<a id="Styles" name="Styles"></a><h1>Styles</h1>

<p>Most alcoholic beverages have regulations governing their classification and labeling. Modern absinthe is not governed in this way and classification is difficult, and by nature inaccurate. Historically, there were five grades of absinthe: <i>ordinaire</i>, <i>demi-fine</i>, <i>fine</i>, <i>supérieure</i> and <i>Suisse</i> (which does not denote origin), in order of increasing alcoholic strength and quality. A supérieure and Suisse would always be naturally colored and distilled. Ordinaire and demi-fine could be artificially colored and made from oil extracts. These terms are no longer used as an industry standard, but some brands today still use the <i>Suisse</i> designation on their labels. Many contemporary absinthe critics use two classifications to denote quality; Distilled and Mix Absinthe. Within these two process-based classifications exist substantial variations in quality due to variations in the raw materials used, and should not be viewed as complete measures of quality. </p>
<a id="Blanche/la_Bleue" name="Blanche/la_Bleue"></a><h2>Blanche/la Bleue</h2>
<p>Blanche absinthe (also referred to as la Bleue in Switzerland) is bottled directly following distillation and is unaltered. It is a clear liquid which contains the distilled oils of the herbs used in its production. The name la Bleue was originally a term used for bootleg Swiss absinthe, but has become a popular term for Swiss absinthe in general.</p>
<a id="Verte" name="Verte"></a><h2>Verte</h2>
<p>Verte (green in French) absinthe begins as a blanche. The distillate is altered by the &#39;coloring step&#39; whereby a new mixture of herbs remain in contact with the clear distillate. This process greatly alters the color and flavor, imparting an emerald green hue and a heavier, more intense flavor. This type of absinthe was most commonly consumed in the 19th century and is what is generally thought of as absinthe. {{Fact}}</p>
<p>Artificially colored green absinthe is called &#34;verte&#34; although it often lacks the herbal characteristic from the natural coloring step.</p>

Often called Bohemian-style, Czech-style, anise-free absinthe or just absinth (without the &#39;e&#39;), it is best described as a wormwood bitters and is produced mainly in the <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic" id="w">Czech Republic</a> where it gets its <a href="/wiki/Bohemian" id="w">Bohemian</a> and Czech designations, although not all absinthe from the Czech Republic is Bohemian style.<sup id="_ref-WSC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WSC" title="">[12]</a></sup> It contains little to no anise, fennel or other herbs normally found in traditional absinthe that was popular in the 19th century, and is often more bitter from chemicals such as absinthine. Often the only similarities with its traditional counterpart are the use of wormwood and a high alcohol content. In most cases, Bohemian-style absinths are not processed by distillation, but are rather high-proof alcohol which has been cold-mixed with herbal extracts and artificial coloring.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Contemporary Czech producers claim absinth has been produced in the Czech Republic since the 1920s,<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> but there is no independent evidence to support these claims.<sup id="_ref-WSC_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WSC" title="">[12]</a></sup> Since there are currently few legal definitions for absinthe, producers have taken advantage of its romantic 19th century associations and psychoactive reputation to market their products under a similar name. Many Bohemian-style producers heavily market thujone content,<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> exploiting the many myths and half truths that surround thujone even though none of these types of absinth appear to contain enough thujone to cause any noticeable effect.</p>
<p>Bohemian-style absinth lacks many of the oils in absinthe that create the louche,<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> and a modern ritual involving fire is often used that takes this into account. In this ritual, absinth is added to a glass and a sugar cube on a spoon is placed over it. The sugar cube is soaked in absinth then set on fire. The cube is then dropped into the absinth setting it on fire, and water is added until the fire goes out, normally a 1:1 ratio.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The crumbling sugar can provide a minor simulation of the louche seen in traditional absinthe, and the lower water ratio enhances effects of the high-strength alcohol.</p>
<p>It is sometimes claimed that this ritual is old and traditional, but there is no supporting evidence. It was first included in marketing after being observed in a Prague bar in the late 1990s<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> and incorporated into its history as the classic method, which has been accepted by many as historical fact, largely because this method has filtered its way into several contemporary movies.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Amongst many of the more traditional absinthe enthusiasts, this preparation method is scorned, and it can negatively affect the flavor of traditional absinthe.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are a few Czech products that claim to have levels of thujone, which would make them illegal to sell in Europe, as well as the rest of the world.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> Some of the most expensive Czech products go to the extent of macerating wormwood in the bottle quite similar to an absinthe kit.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> There is no historical basis for a thujone level this high.</p>
<a id="Storage" name="Storage"></a><h1>Storage</h1>
<p>Absinthe that is artificially colored or clear is relatively stable and can be bottled in a clear container. If naturally colored absinthe is exposed to light, the chlorophyll breaks down, changing the color from emerald green to yellow green to brown. Pre-ban and vintage absinthes are often of a distinct amber color as a result of this process. Though this color is considered a mark of maturity in vintage absinthes, it is regarded as undesirable in contemporary absinthe. Due to this fragility, naturally colored absinthe is typically bottled in dark UV resistant wine bottles. </p>
<p>Absinthe should be stored in a cool, <a href="/wiki/Room_temperature" id="w">room temperature</a>, dry place away from light and heat.  They should also be kept out of the refrigerator and freezer as anethole can crystalize inside the bottle, creating a &#39;scum&#39; in the bottle which may or may not dissolve back into solution as the bottle warms.  Properly stored absinthes not only maintain their quality, but many improve in aroma, flavor, and complexity with aging.</p>

The precise origin of absinthe is unclear. The medical use of wormwood dates back to <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">ancient Egypt</a> and is mentioned in the <a href="/wiki/Ebers_Papyrus" id="w">Ebers Papyrus</a>, circa 1550 BC.

According to legend, absinthe began as an all-purpose patent <a href="/wiki/Remedy" id="w">remedy</a> created by Dr. Pierre Ordinaire, a French doctor living in <a href="/wiki/Couvet" id="w">Couvet</a>, <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>, around 1792 (the exact date varies by account). Ordinaire&#39;s recipe was passed on to the Henriod sisters of Couvet, who sold absinthe as a medicinal <a href="/wiki/Tincture" id="w">elixir</a>. By other accounts, the Henriod sisters may have been making the elixir before Ordinaire&#39;s arrival. In either case, one Major Dubied acquired the formula from the sisters and in 1797, with his son Marcellin and son-in-law Henry-Louis Pernod, opened the first absinthe distillery, Dubied Père et Fils, in Couvet. In 1805 they built a second distillery in <a href="/wiki/Pontarlier" id="w">Pontarlier, France</a>, under the new company name Maison Pernod Fils.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<p>Spurred by the <a href="/wiki/Temperance_movement" id="w">temperance movement</a> and wine makers&#39; associations, absinthe was publicized in connection with violent crimes supposedly committed under its influence. This, combined with rising hard liquor consumption caused by the <a href="/wiki/Phylloxera" id="w">wine shortage in France</a> during the 1880s and 1890s, effectively labeled absinthe a social menace.</p>

In the 1990s an importer, <a href="/wiki/George_Rowley_(entrepreneur)" id="w">BBH Spirits</a>, realized that there was no <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">UK</a> law prohibiting the sale of absinthe (as it was never banned there) other than the standard regulations governing <a href="/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage" id="w">alcoholic beverages</a>. <a href="/wiki/Hill%26%2339%3Bs_Liquere" id="w">Hill&#39;s Liquere</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic" id="w">Czech Republic</a> distillery founded in 1920, began manufacturing Hill&#39;s Absinth, a Bohemian-style absinth, which sparked a modern resurgence in absinthe&#39;s popularity.</p>
<p>It has never been banned in <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a> or <a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portugal</a>, where it continues to be made. The former Spanish and Portuguese New World colonies, especially <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a>, allow the sale of absinthe, and it has retained popularity through the years.</p>
<p>France never repealed its 1915 law, but in 1988 a law was passed to clarify that only beverages that do not comply with <a href="/wiki/European_Union" id="w">European Union</a> regulations with respect to <a href="/wiki/Thujone" id="w">thujone</a> content, or beverages that call themselves &#39;absinthe&#39; explicitly, fall under that law. This has resulted in the re-emergence of French absinthes, now labeled <i>spiritueux à base de plantes d&#39;absinthe</i> (&#39;wormwood-based spirits&#39;). Interestingly, as the 1915 law regulates only the sale of absinthe in France but not its production, many manufacturers also produce variants destined for export which are plainly labeled &#39;absinthe&#39;. <a href="/wiki/La_F%C3%A9e_Absinthe" id="w">La Fée Absinthe</a>, released in 2000, was the first brand of absinthe distilled and bottled in France since the 1915 ban, initially for export from France, but now one of over twenty French &#39;spiritueux ... d&#39;absinthe&#39; available in France.</p>
<p>Absinthe has never been illegal to import or manufacture in Australia. Importation requires a permit under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation 1956 due to a restriction on importing any product containing &#34;oil of wormwood&#34;.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup>  In 2000 there was an amendment by Foods Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) as part of a new consolidation of the Food Code across Australia and New Zealand to make all wormwood species prohibited herbs for food purposes under Food Standard 1.4.4. Prohibited and Restricted Plants and Fungi but this was inconsistent with other parts of the pre-existing Food Code.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> The proposed amendment was withdrawn in 2002 during the transition between the two Codes, thereby continuing to allow absinthe manufacture and importation through the existing permit-based system.

<p>In Switzerland, the constitutional ban on absinthe was repealed in 2000 during an overhaul of the national constitution, however the prohibition was written into ordinary law instead. Later that law was repealed, so from <a href="/wiki/1_March" id="w">1 March</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, absinthe is legal in its country of origin, after nearly a century of prohibition.

<p>It is once again legal to produce and sell absinthe in practically every country where alcohol is legal, the major exception being the United States, but as of 2007 absinthe&#39;s &#34;banned status&#34; in the States is changing.

<p>German for home-made (often abbreviated HG), also called clandestine (not to be confused with the brand), hausgemacht absinthe is home distilled by hobbyists. Mainly for personal use and not for sale, clandestine absinthe is produced in small quantities allowing experienced distillers to select the best herbs and fine tune each batch. Clandestine production increased after the ban on absinthe, when small producers went underground, most notably in Switzerland. Although the Swiss produced both vertes and blanches before the ban, clear absinthe (known as La Bleue) became popular as it was easier to hide. Though the Swiss ban was recently lifted, many clandestine distillers have yet to become legal. Authorities believe high taxes on alcohol and the mystique of being underground has kept many from seeking a license.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Those that have become legal often use the &#39;clandestine&#39; moniker on their products.

It was thought that excessive absinthe drinking had worse effects than those associated with overindulgence in other forms of alcohol, which was bound to be true for those consuming cheaper adulterated products, and led to the disease of &#39;absinthism&#39;.  One of the first vilifications of Absinthe was an 1864 experiment in which Dr. Magnan exposed a <a href="/wiki/Guinea_pig" id="w">guinea pig</a> to large doses of pure wormwood oil vapor and another to alcohol vapors. The guinea pig exposed to wormwood had seizures while the other did not.  He would later blame the chemical <a href="/wiki/Thujone" id="w">thujone</a> for these effects. Based on this he concluded absinthe was more dangerous than alcohol, disregarding the small amounts of wormwood oil likely to be consumed by drinkers.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Past reports estimated thujone levels in absinthe as high — up to 260 mg per kg of absinthe.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> More recent studies have shown that very little of the thujone present in wormwood actually makes it into a properly distilled absinthe, even one using historical recipes and methods. Most proper absinthes, both vintage and modern, are within the current EU limits.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-emmert_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emmert" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> A recent French distiller has had to add pure <a href="/wiki/Essential_oil" id="w">essential oil</a> of wormwood to make a &#39;high thujone&#39; variant of his product. It can remain in higher amounts in oils produced by other methods than distillation, or when wormwood is macerated and not distilled, especially when the plant stems are used, where thujone content is the highest. Tests on mice show an <a href="/wiki/LD50" id="w">LD50</a> of around 45 mg thujone per kg of body weight,<sup id="_ref-thujone_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thujone" title="">[45]</a></sup> much higher than what is contained in absinthe and the high amount of alcohol would kill a person many times over before the thujone became a danger.<sup id="_ref-thujone_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thujone" title="">[45]</a></sup> Although direct effects on humans are unknown, many have consumed thujone in higher amounts than present in absinthe through non-controversial sources like <a href="/wiki/Common_sage" id="w">common sage</a> and its oil, which can be up to 50% thujone.<sup id="_ref-sage oil_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sage oil" title="">[46]</a></sup> Long term effects of low wormwood consumption in humans are unknown as well.  The deleterious effects of absinthe as well as its hallucinogenic properties are a persistent myth often repeated without support in modern books and scientific journals.</p>
<a id="Effects" name="Effects"></a><h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Absinthe has long been believed to be hallucinogenic.  Ten years after Dr. Magnan&#39;s experiments with wormwood oil, he studied 250 cases of alcoholism and claimed that those who drank absinthe were worse off than those drinking alcohol, and that they experienced, among other things, rapid-onset hallucinations.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup>  Few descriptions of these hallucinations exist from absinthe drinkers, beyond a few quotes from poets after a night of drinking.  In one of the most famous, <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Wilde" id="w">Oscar Wilde</a> describes the feeling of tulips on his legs after leaving a bar.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> These beliefs got a boost in the 1970s when a scientific paper mistakenly reported <a href="/wiki/Thujone" id="w">thujone</a> was related to <a href="/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol" id="w">THC</a> and most likely had similar hallucinogenic properties based on its shape.<sup id="_ref-thc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thc" title="">[49]</a></sup>  With the advent of usenet and web recipes &#39;trip reports&#39; have been circulating for many years. These home recipes sometimes call for known hallucinogenic herbs in a mistaken attempt to recreate Absinthe&#39;s supposed hallucinogenic effects.</p>
<p>Today it is known that absinthe does not cause hallucinations(expect Czech Strong), especially those described in the old studies.  Thujone, the supposed active chemical in absinthe, is a GABA antagonist and while it can produce muscle spasms in large doses, there is no evidence it causes hallucinations.</p>
<p>It has been speculated that absinthe&#39;s effects were due to poisonous chemicals being added to cheaper products in an effort by the makers to give their products a more vivid colour.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>The effects of absinthe have been described by artists as mind opening and even <a href="/wiki/Psychedelics%2C_dissociatives_and_deliriants" id="w">hallucinogenic</a> and by prohibitionists as &#34;turning good people mad and desolate.&#34; Sometimes called &#39;secondary effects&#39;, the most commonly reported experience is a &#39;clear-headed&#39; feeling of inebriation &#8212; a &#39;lucid drunkenness&#39;, said to be caused by the thujone and other compounds.  Some, such as chemist and absinthe historian Ted Breaux, say that these effects may be caused by the fact that some of the compounds act as stimulants, others as sedatives, overall creating a neutral effect.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> Most others feel that the <a href="/wiki/Placebo_effect" id="w">placebo effect</a> and individual reaction to the herbs make these secondary effects subjective and minor compared to the <a href="/wiki/Psychoactive" id="w">psychoactive</a> effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>A study in the <i>Journal of Studies on Alcohol</i><sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> concluded that a high concentration of thujone in alcohol has negative effects on attention performance. It slowed down <a href="/wiki/Reaction_time" id="w">reaction time</a>, and subjects concentrated their attention in the central field of vision. Medium doses did not produce an effect noticeably different from plain alcohol. The high dose of thujone in this study was larger than what one can get from current beyond-EU-regulation &#39;high thujone&#39; absinthe before becoming too drunk to notice, and while the effects of even this high dose were <a href="/wiki/Statistical_significance" id="w">statistically significant</a> in a double blind test, the test subjects themselves could still not reliably identify which samples were the ones containing thujone. As most people describe the effects of absinthe as a more lucid and aware drunk, this suggests that thujone alone is not the cause of these effects.</p>

The legacy of absinthe as a mysterious, addictive, and mind-altering drink continues to this day. Absinthe has been seen or featured in fine art, movies, video, music and literature. The modern absinthe revival has had an effect on its portrayal. It is often shown as an unnaturally glowing green liquid which is set on fire before drinking, even though traditionally neither is true.  In addition, it is most commonly known in the media for over the top hallucinations.</p>
<a id="Historical" name="Historical"></a><h2>Historical</h2>
<p>Numerous artists and writers living in France during the late 19th and early 20th centuries were noted absinthe drinkers and featured absinthe in their works. These include <a href="/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh" id="w">Vincent van Gogh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Édouard_Manet" id="w">Édouard Manet</a>, <a href="/wiki/Guy_de_Maupassant" id="w">Guy de Maupassant</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Rimbaud" id="w">Arthur Rimbaud</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec" id="w">Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paul_Verlaine" id="w">Paul Verlaine</a>.

<p>The mystery and illicit quality surrounding the popular view of absinthe has played into modern music, movies and television shows. These depictions vary in their authenticity, often applying <a href="/wiki/Dramatic_license" id="w">dramatic license</a> to depict the drink as everything from <a href="/wiki/Aphrodisiac" id="w">aphrodisiac</a> to <a href="/wiki/Poison" id="w">poison</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, most countries do not have a legal definition of absinthe (unlike <a href="/wiki/Scotch_whisky" id="w">Scotch whisky</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cognac_(spirit)" id="w">cognac</a>). Manufacturers can label a product &#39;absinthe&#39; or &#39;absinth&#39;, whether or not it matches the traditional definition. Due to many countries never banning absinthe, not every country has regulations specifically governing it.</p>
<a id="Australia" name="Australia"></a><h2>Australia</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Bitters" id="w">Bitters</a> can contain a maximum 35 mg/kg thujone, other alcoholic beverages can contain a maximum 10 mg/kg<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> of thujone. In Australia, import and sales require a special permit although absinthe is readily available in many <a href="/wiki/Bottle_shop" id="w">bottle shops</a>.</p>
<p>Absinthe containing wormwood cannot be sent through the Australian postal system. It is unresolved  whether or not it is permitted in luggage in non-commercial quantities for personal use.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Liquor_laws" id="w">liquor laws</a> are under the jurisdiction of the provincial governments. <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a> has no limits on thujone content, although several associations are petitioning for bans{{Fact}}; <a href="/wiki/Alberta" id="w">Alberta</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ontario" id="w">Ontario</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nova_Scotia" id="w">Nova Scotia</a> allow 10 mg/kg thujone; <a href="/wiki/Qu%C3%A9bec" id="w">Québec</a> allows 15 mg per kg (according to the <a href="/wiki/SAQ" id="w">SAQ</a>){{Fact}}; and all other provinces do not allow the sale of absinthe containing thujone (although, in <a href="/wiki/Saskatchewan" id="w">Saskatchewan</a>, one can purchase any liquor, with a minimum of one case, usually 12 bottles x 750 ml or 8 x 1L). Individual liquor boards must approve each product before it may be sold, and currently only Hill&#39;s Absinth, Czech Absinth s.r.o., Elie-Arnaud Denoix, Pernod, Absente, Versinthe and, in limited release, La Fée Absinthe are approved.  Like any alcohol, absinthe can only be imported by the proper government agencies and imports by individuals to a private address are prohibited.</p>
<p>Production is also regulated by the provincial government.  Recently, Okanagan Spirits in British Columbia was allowed to distill a traditional style of absinthe that closely resembles absinthes from France and Switzerland.  </p>
<p>Okanagan Spirits, a distillery based in Vernon BC, has produced Taboo, which has been approved for sale in BC, Alberta and Ontario and is even available on the shelves of BC&#39;s provincially run liquor stores.  This is Canada&#39;s only authentic Absinthe, made using a traditional European recipe.</p>
<a id="European_Union" name="European_Union"></a><h2>European Union</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/European_Union" id="w">European Union</a> permits a maximum thujone level of 10 mg/kg in alcoholic beverages with more than 25% <a href="/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume" id="w">ABV</a>, and 35 mg/kg in alcohol labeled as bitters.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> Member countries regulate absinthe production within this framework. Sale of absinthe is permitted in all <a href="/wiki/List_of_European_Union_member_states" id="w">EU countries</a> unless they further regulate it.

<a id="France" name="France"></a><h2>France</h2>
<p>In addition to EU standards, products explicitly called &#39;absinthe&#39; cannot be sold in France, although they can be produced for export. Absinthe is now commonly labeled as <i>spiritueux à base de plantes d&#39;absinthe</i> (&#39;wormwood-based spirits&#39;). France also regulates <a href="/wiki/Fenchone" id="w">fenchone</a>, a chemical in the herb <a href="/wiki/Fennel" id="w">fennel</a>, to 5 mg/l.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> This makes many brands of Swiss absinthe illegal without reformulation.</p>
<a id="Switzerland" name="Switzerland"></a><h2>Switzerland</h2>
<p>In Switzerland the sale and production of absinthe was prohibited from 1908 to 2005, but the ban was lifted on March 1, 2005.  To be legally made or sold in Switzerland, absinthe must be distilled and either uncolored or naturally colored.</p>
<a id="United_States" name="United_States"></a><h2>United States</h2>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection" id="w">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a> literature, &#34;The importation of Absinthe and any other liquors or liqueurs that contain <i>Artemisia absinthium</i> is prohibited.&#34;<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> On the other hand, FDA regulations  allow Artemisia species in foods or beverages, but those that contain Artemisia species, white cedar, <a href="/wiki/Oakmoss" id="w">oak moss</a>, tansy or Yarrow, must be thujone free.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> Other herbs that contain <a href="/wiki/Thujone" id="w">thujone</a> have no restrictions. For example, sage and <a href="/wiki/Sage_oil" id="w">sage oil</a> (which can be almost 50% thujone<sup id="_ref-sage oil_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sage oil" title="">[46]</a></sup>) are on the FDA&#39;s list of substances <a href="/wiki/Generally_recognized_as_safe" id="w">generally recognized as safe</a>.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>The prevailing consensus of interpretation of <a href="/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States" id="w">United States law</a> and regulations among American absinthe connoisseurs is that it is probably legal to purchase such a product for personal use in the U.S. It is prohibited to sell items meant for human consumption which contain thujone derived from <i>Artemisia</i> species. (This derives from a <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration" id="w">Food and Drug Administration</a> regulation, as opposed to a <a href="/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration" id="w">DEA</a> regulation.) Customs regulations specifically forbid the importation of &#39;absinthe&#39;. Absinthe can be and occasionally is seized by United States Customs if it appears to be for human consumption and can be seized inside the U.S. with a warrant.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>A faux-absinthe liquor called <a href="/wiki/Absente" id="w">Absente</a>, made with <i>southern wormwood</i> (<i><a href="/wiki/Artemisia_abrotanum" id="w">Artemisia abrotanum</a></i>) instead of grande wormwood (<i><a href="/wiki/Artemisia_absinthium" id="w">Artemisia absinthium</a></i>), is sold legally in the United States and does not contain Grande Wormwood.  This was the first US approval referring to &#34;absinthe&#34; on the front label; the front label says &#34;Absinthe Refined&#34; but the US <a href="/wiki/Alcohol_and_Tobacco_Tax_and_Trade_Bureau" id="w">Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau</a> (TTB) classified the product as Liqueur.</p>
<p>In 2007 the first legally available absinthe has been approved for sale in the United States. These brands must pass TTB testing, which is performed by the <a href="/wiki/Gas_chromatography-mass_spectrometry" id="w">Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry</a> method<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> and TTB considers a product to be thujone-free if the FDA&#39;s test measures less than 10ppm (equal to 10mg/kg) thujone.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Vanuatu" name="Vanuatu"></a><h2>Vanuatu</h2>
<p>The Absinthe (Prohibition) Act 1915, passed in the <a href="/wiki/New_Hebrides" id="w">New Hebrides</a>, has never been repealed, and is included in the 1988 <a href="/wiki/Vanuatu" id="w">Vanuatu</a> consolidated legislation, and contains the following all-encompassing restriction: The manufacture, importation, circulation and sale wholesale or by retail of absinthe or similar liquors in Vanuatu shall be prohibited.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
