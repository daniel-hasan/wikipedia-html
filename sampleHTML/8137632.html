<b>Joel Larson</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Rock_music" id="w">rock</a> <a href="/wiki/Drummer" id="w">drummer</a> and percussionist from California. He was born on <a href="/wiki/April_29" id="w">April 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/1947" id="w">1947</a> in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco%2C_California" id="w">San Francisco, California</a> where he lived until he was 17 years old. He took up drumming at the age of 12 and during the next five years honed his skills in the rock music scene of the early sixties. His destiny was to become one of <a href="/wiki/The_Grass_Roots" id="w">The Grass Roots</a>, a rock group that enjoyed a successful hit making output of music from 1967 to 1972.</p>
<p>In 1965, Larson joined a band called The Bedouins and helped them win a Battle of the Bands in San Mateo. Word began to spread about the band. In early 1966, they were asked to come to an audition at the San Francisco Whisky A Go Go. They performed for <a href="/wiki/Lou_Adler" id="w">Lou Adler</a> who was the head of the new label <a href="/wiki/Dunhill_Records" id="w">Dunhill Records</a> in Los Angeles. They were selected to become the original Grass Roots, a folk rock group created by songwriters <a href="/wiki/P.F._Sloan" id="w">P.F. Sloan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Steve_Barri" id="w">Steve Barri</a>.</p>
<p>The original Grass Roots were Denny Ellis on rhythm guitar, Willie Fulton on vocals and lead guitar, Joel Larson on drums and Dave Stensen on bass. They moved to <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" id="w">Los Angeles</a> in 1966, took part in recording sessions and played live performances in the exploding LA music scene. They were one of the first house bands for The Trip on the <a href="/wiki/Sunset_Strip" id="w">Sunset Strip</a>. All of The Grass Roots were under the age of 18 so their parents had to sign their contracts with Dunhill Records. They also performed as a TV back up band for <a href="/wiki/The_Mamas_and_the_Papas" id="w">The Mamas and the Papas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Johnny_Rivers" id="w">Johnny Rivers</a>. They appeared on the first color broadcast of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Ed_Sullivan_Show" id="w">The Ed Sullivan Show</a></i>. After about a year of live performances and networking in the LA rock music scene, the group wanted to have more creative control and input on the selection of songs to perform and record. Dunhill Records had a formula for the group already in mind and did not want to vary from it. The group minus Joel returned to San Francisco and continued to perform until Dunhill Records decided to replace them. Joel was offered to continue with new group members but decided to take an opportunity to play with <a href="/wiki/Gene_Clark" id="w">Gene Clark</a> of <a href="/wiki/The_Byrds" id="w">The Byrds</a> fame. He then met <a href="/wiki/Emitt_Rhodes" id="w">Emitt Rhodes</a> and formed <a href="/wiki/The_Merry-Go-Round" id="w">The Merry-Go-Round</a> that same year. He also played with <a href="/wiki/The_Turtles" id="w">The Turtles</a> in the late 60s. Starting in 1970, he played with <a href="/wiki/Lee_Michaels" id="w">Lee Michaels</a> and helped produce the huge radio hit &#34;Do You Know What I Mean&#34;.</p>
<p>In 1971, he rejoined The Grass Roots and played with them through the end of their heyday in 1975. From 1975 on, he continued to perform their hits until the mid eighties. In the new wave era, he worked as a dance night promoter in Los Angeles with live broadcasts through <a href="/wiki/KROC" id="w">KROC</a> radio. He then entered into property management and real estate investment while continuing as a musician in Los Angeles playing with members of <a href="/wiki/The_Buckinghams" id="w">The Buckinghams</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paul_Revere_%26amp%3B_The_Raiders" id="w">Paul Revere &#38; The Raiders</a>.</p>
<p>In 2000, Joel started work in the movie and TV entertainment industry as a driver and production coordinator. He has built a long list of credits which include major motion pictures such as <i><a href="/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_III" id="w">Mission: Impossible III</a></i> (2006) and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Bucket_List" id="w">The Bucket List</a></i> (2007). Joel continues as a musician playing live performances with other notable musicians in the LA area to the present day.</p>
