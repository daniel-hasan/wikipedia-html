<p>The <b>Galactic Republic</b> is the name of the interplanetary government used in the fictional <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" id="w">Star Wars</a> <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_universe" id="w">universe</a> prior to the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Star_Wars)" id="w">Galactic Empire</a>. The form of this government created by the <a href="/wiki/Senate" id="w">Senate</a>, was introduced in the <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_prequel_trilogy" id="w">Prequel Trilogy</a>. By the time of the original <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy, it is referred to as the <b>Old Republic</b>. It was a democratic, though eventually ineffectual, <a href="/wiki/Constitution" id="w">constitutional</a> <a href="/wiki/Republic" id="w">republic</a> tied up in layers of <a href="/wiki/Bureaucracy" id="w">bureaucracy</a>.</p>
<p>The Republic, as it was commonly known, was a <a href="/wiki/Republic" id="w">republican</a> government that was able to sustain itself for over twenty-five thousand years.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>

<p>The Republic itself was formed over 25,000 <a href="/wiki/Dates_in_Star_Wars" id="w">BBY</a> when the first &#34;Galactic Constitution&#34; was signed on <a href="/wiki/Coruscant" id="w">Coruscant</a>. Whether this means that Coruscant was the original homeworld of humans or simply the most powerful world at the time is still up for debate, and there has been little said about the event other than that it occurred. The Republic was made up of about a million worlds.</p>
<a id="The_Galactic_Senate" name="The_Galactic_Senate"></a><h1>The Galactic Senate</h1>
<p>The Republic began as a mutual protection and economic alliance among a number of planets in the Galactic Core. Each member world chose a Senator to represent them in the Republic Senate, a central Legislative body. Senators were ambassadors of their homeworld, and member worlds were able to maintain their government and society in accordance with local beliefs, customs, and traditions. There were a wide variety of different local governments along the political spectrum: from <a href="/wiki/Monarchies" id="w">Monarchies</a> to Republics to Hive-like <a href="/wiki/Commune_(intentional_community)" id="w">communes</a>. In some systems, the senator was elected to that post, in others the world government appointed the senator. <a href="/wiki/Naboo" id="w">Naboo</a>&#39;s monarch appointed their senator, while the <a href="/wiki/Alderaan" id="w">Alderaan</a> Council of Elders elected their senator out of their own ranks (usually the heir to the Royal House of Organa and their bloodline, as the heir was also the leader of the council).</p>
<p>When the Republic&#39;s power and influence expanded, many new areas of the galaxy were incorporated into the Republic. A reorganization of Senatorial representation occurred 1,000 BBY during the Ruusan Reformation. The most common organization for these new territories was to group regions into Sectors of about 50 inhabited worlds. Each sector is represented by a Senatorial Delegation. When the number of sectors became too large, sectors were organized into roughly a thousand regions, each represented by one delegation to the Senate. </p>
<p>The Senate served as the governing body of the Galactic Republic, while the Jedi Order served as its defenders. The Senate, and therefore the seat of government, was established on the planet <a href="/wiki/Coruscant" id="w">Coruscant</a>, coordinates 0-0-0 in the standard galactic coordinate system, signifying its central location in the galaxy.</p>
<p>The Senate, according to the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/organization/galacticsenate/?id=eu" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.starwars.com/databank/organization/galacticsenate/?id=eu">Star Wars.com Databank</a>, was an enormous building containing 1,024 floating platforms, each of which contained a senator and his or her aides. Each platform in the senate represented a &#34;sector&#34; of the galaxy, with one senator for that sector accompanied by a delegation of aides and advisers. Some platforms represented individual worlds bringing special pleas to the senate, others the <a href="/wiki/Special_interest" id="w">special interest</a> guilds such as the Trade Alliance. Along with the senators, the leaders of the individual member planets apparently also had the power to vote in the Senate and introduce legislation. Each senatorial delegation had one vote. </p>
<p>The members of the Senate then elected a <i><a href="/wiki/Supreme_Chancellor" id="w">Chancellor</a></i> from amongst their ranks who served as the Senate&#39;s presiding officer and as the Republic&#39;s de facto leader. The Chancellor was assisted by the Vice Chair, who is presumably elected in the same manner as the Chancellor; the same Vice Chair is present throughout the entire prequel trilogy. Based on the films, we can see that the Senate followed pseudo-<a href="/wiki/Parliamentary" id="w">parliamentary</a> rules. In <a href="/wiki/The_Phantom_Menace" id="w">Episode One</a>, Supreme Chancellor <a href="/wiki/Finis_Valorum" id="w">Finis Valorum</a> was forced out of office by the Senate in a <a href="/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence" id="w">motion of no confidence</a>, introduced by <a href="/wiki/Queen_Amidala" id="w">Queen Amidala</a>.</p>
<p>Senators received one vote in all matters, procedural and substantive. The President was elected from within the Senate for a set term (presumably up to two terms of four years, the Senate can also give the Chancellor emergency powers as well as remove him from office when necessary, as given throughout various books and movies of the <a href="/wiki/Prequel_Trilogy_(Star_Wars)" id="w">prequel trilogy</a>.) The assembly was in turn divided into individual committees, each specializing in specific fields of government administration, and which were responsible for creating legislation to be reviewed by the full assembly. The Senate had some form of judicial power as well, although the Republic&#39;s judicial branch was the Supreme Court and the Senate&#39;s power in this area may have been limited to trying its own members.</p>
<p>Although legislation passed by the Senate was binding to all member worlds, most of the everyday legislation followed by citizens of the Republic was created at the planetary, sector, or regional level. Therefore, the main functions of the Senate were to mediate disputes between members, provide for the common defense, and regulate inter-system trade. The Jedi, who answered to the Chancellor, became traveling representatives of the Senate responsible not only for protecting the Republic and its citizens, but also to serve as representatives of the Republic and as mediators for individual disputes.</p>
<p>The Republic&#39;s greatest failing was its lack of formal organization. Much of its operation is based on non-binding <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)" id="w">constitutional conventions</a>, which were often ignored and undermined by corrupt and power-hungry <a href="/wiki/Politician" id="w">politicians</a>. Coalition governments were common with <a href="/wiki/Special_interest" id="w">special interests</a> defining the legislative agenda.</p>
<p>However, the waning years of the Republic were a time of corruption and great social injustice. The Senate became divided between those who genuinely wished to uphold the values and ideals of the Republic and those who wished to futther their own goals. After a series of weak and ineffectual Chancellors and a crisis involving the invasion of Naboo by the <a href="/wiki/Trade_Federation" id="w">Trade Federation</a> over a <a href="/wiki/Tariff" id="w">tariff</a> passed in the Senate, the time came for strong leadership to end the corruption.</p>
<p>After Palpatine became Chancellor, he increased the power of the office from acting as commander-in-chief of the <a href="/wiki/Army_of_the_Republic" id="w">Grand Army of the Republic</a> to the institution of his personal bodyguard, <a href="/wiki/Emperor%26%2339%3Bs_Royal_Guard" id="w">the Red Guard</a>. The rights of many, including the Galactic Senate, were relinquished in the name of security. The removal of privacy screens in the Galactic Senate, which allow senators to discuss issues before the Senate in private resulted in many senators afraid to voice their response to a vote because of the installed surveillance hovercams listening in on every word and reporting to the Senate Security Chief. The Galactic Senate also met less often as the Chancellor was voted more emergency powers. </p>

</p><a id="Galactic_Senators/Politicians" name="Galactic_Senators/Politicians"></a><h2>Galactic Senators/Politicians</h2>
<p>Politicians include Senators, the Chancellor, the Vice Chair of the Senate, the Administrative Aide, various Representatives from each system, and the members of the Jedi Council. Non-council Jedi aren&#39;t necessarily non-politicians, but the special status of the Jedi Council enabled those on it them to have a substantial degree of power and moral authority. One Jedi master, <a href="/wiki/Luminara_Unduli" id="w">Luminara Unduli</a> was the only non-council member to get as much power in politics as a member of the Senate.</p>
<a id="The_Jedi_and_Jedi_Council" name="The_Jedi_and_Jedi_Council"></a><h1>The Jedi and Jedi Council</h1>
<p>{{Main}}
The <a href="/wiki/Jedi" id="w">Jedi</a> function as a peacekeeping force in the Republic, wielding considerable political power. The Jedi with the most power were members of the <a href="/wiki/Jedi_Council" id="w">Jedi Council</a>. <a href="/wiki/Yoda" id="w">Yoda</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mace_Windu" id="w">Mace Windu</a> as the two leaders of the Council had the highest authority of all Jedi. The Chancellor had nominal authority over the Jedi Council, although this power was rarely invoked before the election of <a href="/wiki/Palpatine" id="w">Palpatine</a>. The Chancellor also had a holographic projector in his office so Jedi on very important missions could contact the Chancellor, any senators, and any Jedi there. When Obi-Wan Kenobi contacted Coruscant from <a href="/wiki/Geonosis" id="w">Geonosis</a> after witnessing <a href="/wiki/Count_Dooku" id="w">Count Dooku</a>&#39;s meeting with <a href="/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems" id="w">Separatist</a> forces, his hologram appeared at Palpatine&#39;s office while being witnessed by Palpatine, Yoda, Windu and many senators, Jedi, and Council members.</p>
<a id="The_Republic_Military" name="The_Republic_Military"></a><h1>The Republic Military</h1>
<p>For most of its history since the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Ruusan" id="w">Battle of Ruusan</a>, the Republic did not maintain an <a href="/wiki/Army" id="w">army</a> except as a token force for military parades and showing the flag. This was to display the Republic&#39;s peaceful ideals, as the Republic used Jedi Knights as &#34;keepers of the peace.&#34;</p>
<p>Several trade organizations, such as the Trade Federation and <a href="/wiki/Commerce_Guild" id="w">Commerce Guild</a>, kept armies of <a href="/wiki/Droid" id="w">droids</a> in order to protect their profits, but benefited from this, such as when the Trade Federation invaded and occupied Naboo, resulting in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Naboo" id="w">Battle of Naboo</a>. Individual sectors also maintained their own security forces, such as Naboo Security Force or the <a href="/wiki/CorSec" id="w">CorSec</a> from <a href="/wiki/Corellia" id="w">Corellia</a>, and these were sometimes used to combat small threats. However there was no centralized command, and the members of the Republic were loath to change this.   Since most of the military power within the Republic&#39;s territory was not actually controlled by the Republic, but by member planets such as Naboo or organizations such as the Techno Union and the Intergalactic Banking Clan, the ability of the Senate to enforce its decrees was severely limited, and it was forced to rely on the Jedi. Conversely, however, the Trade Federation and other cartels within the Republic, some of which were represented in the Senate, held that a Republic government which lacked significant military power was just what they wanted, since it couldn&#39;t control them.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Clone_Wars_(Star_Wars)" id="w">The Clone Wars</a> changed all this. The Republic initially had no standing military to deal with the <a href="/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems" id="w">Confederacy of Independent Systems</a> therefore a <b>Military Creation Act</b> was proposed, which was strongly opposed by many of the Republic&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Pacifism" id="w">pacifist</a> leaders, such as Padmé Amidala of Naboo, who feared the possibility of going to war. Supporters included <a href="/wiki/Orn_Free_Taa" id="w">Orn Free Taa</a> of <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_(R-S)#Ryloth" id="w">Ryloth</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_Separatist_characters#Aak, Ask" id="w">Ask Aak</a> of <a href="/wiki/Planets_of_Star_Wars#Malastare" id="w">Malastare</a>.</p>
<p>However, a <a href="/wiki/Clone_troopers" id="w">Clone Army</a> had already been created in secret on the planet <a href="/wiki/Kamino" id="w">Kamino</a> ten years before. When it becomes clear the Confederacy had no intention of negotiating with the Republic, the Republic adopted this army as the Grand Army of the Republic, along with <a href="/wiki/AT-TE" id="w">AT-TE</a> walkers, <a href="/wiki/Gunship" id="w">gunships</a> and other military vehicles and spacecraft, most of which were produced by Rothan Heavy Engineering.  The Republic&#39;s war effort was initially hindered because most of the major industrial combines in the Galaxy had, under the aegis of the Techno Union, sided with the Confederacy.  The Kamino-bred clones formed the nucleus of the Republic&#39;s new army, and were swiftly augmented by clones from other sources as well as traditional recruiting; within a few years of the Battle of Geonosis, the Republic&#39;s military had expanded astronomically and had become the preeminent military force in the Galaxy. The rapid militarization of the Republic during the Clone Wars, overseen by Chancellor Palpatine, had far-reaching effects; the Senate&#39;s powers were reduced, the military became the primary arm of the government, and the Republic swiftly transitioned into Palpatine&#39;s New Order.</p>
<a id="The_End_of_the_Republic" name="The_End_of_the_Republic"></a><h1>The End of the Republic</h1>
<p>By the time of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Phantom_Menace" id="w">The Phantom Menace</a></i>, the Republic had grown unbearably corrupt. Palpatine became the Chancellor in <a href="/wiki/Dates_in_Star_Wars#SW1" id="w">32 BBY</a> after his predecessor, <a href="/wiki/Finis_Valorum" id="w">Finis Valorum</a>,  who was voted out in a <a href="/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence" id="w">no confidence vote</a> in a wave of protest against his handling of the conflict with the Trade Federation. Traditionally, the Chancellor could only serve two four-year terms, but Palpatine stayed in office much longer, due to the prolonged <a href="/wiki/Clone_Wars_(Star_Wars)" id="w">Separatist Crisis</a> as well as the threat posed by the &#34;Jedi Rebellion.&#34;</p>
<p>The crisis occurred when several of the Republic&#39;s member Star Systems and organizations united in order to separate from the Republic. This unified organization became known as the <a href="/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems" id="w">Confederacy of Independent Systems</a>. Tensions between the Republic and the Separatists eventually escalated into all-out war, and the conflicts that would later be known as the &#34;Clone Wars&#34; began (chronicled in <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_II:_Attack_of_the_Clones" id="w">Attack of the Clones</a></i>).</p>
<p>The Senate granted Palpatine <a href="/wiki/Emergency_powers" id="w">emergency powers</a> to deal with the Separatist Confederacy in a motion introduced by <a href="/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks" id="w">Representative Jar Jar Binks</a>. Palpatine&#39;s first move, widely supported at the time, was to create a vast army of <a href="/wiki/Clone_troopers" id="w">clone warriors</a> to serve as the Republic&#39;s fighting force against the Confederacy. The Republic had not previously needed an army, since until then any small conflicts with in the Republic could be solved with the &#34;peacekeeping&#34; Jedi. However, the fact that the Confederacy had access to an enormous army of <a href="/wiki/Droid" id="w">droid</a> soldiers required the Republic to construct a more formal military to effectively fight. </p>
<p>In the ensuing years, the Senate increasingly granted enormous amounts of power to Palpatine, who became the war&#39;s political <a href="/wiki/Commander-in-Chief" id="w">Commander-in-Chief</a>. Such actions were justified in the name of security, and were considered a perfectly reasonable way to increase the wartime government&#39;s efficiency. Eventually, Palpatine gained enough power that he effectively did not need the approval of the Senate. In effect, he was now a dictator (though he commanded an overwhelming majority in the Senate in any case).</p>
<p>Tension between Palpatine and the Jedi began to grow as the war progressed. Many members of the Jedi Council remained skeptical of Palpatine&#39;s growing powers, especially at the expense of the Senate- the only body they were contractually bound to serve. In time, the Jedi began to believe that Palpatine would not surrender his power at the end of the war. This suspicion was also shared by some senators, including <a href="/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala" id="w">Padmé Amidala</a> of Naboo, <a href="/wiki/Bail_Organa" id="w">Bail Organa</a> of <a href="/wiki/Alderaan" id="w">Alderaan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mon_Mothma" id="w">Mon Mothma</a> of <a href="/wiki/Chandrila" id="w">Chandrila</a>. Indeed, early in the novelization of Episode III, Palpatine has appointed regional governors over the various worlds of the Republic, buttressed by detachments of clones. </p>
<p>After the death of Separatist leader <a href="/wiki/General_Grievous" id="w">General Grievous</a>, and the discovery that Palpatine was actually <a href="/wiki/Darth_Sidious" id="w">Darth Sidious</a>, the Jedi made their move in accordance with contingency plans already made. They attempted to arrest Palpatine, but failed. Shortly afterward, Palpatine secretly issued <a href="/wiki/Order_66" id="w">Order 66</a>, a galaxy-wide instruction for all clone troops to kill their Jedi commanders.  This command had been secretly implanted in all of the clones when they were created. </p>
<p>Many of the Jedi serving as generals of the Army of the Republic quickly fell victim to the clone trooper forces. They overwhelmed the often isolated Jedi, who were taken by surprise; there was no treachery for the Jedi to sense in the minds of the clones that served them. The Jedi remaining in the Temple on Coruscant were eliminated by a detachment of an elite clone stormtroopers led by <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" id="w">Darth Vader</a>, who single-handedly cut down many Jedi himself &#8212; including many children studying as <a href="/wiki/Padawan" id="w">padawans</a> there. </p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Clone Wars, Palpatine addressed the Senate. First he related the story of the unsuccessful assassination attempt by the Jedi.  Claiming that it was a &#34;rebellion&#34; against the Republic, he declared the Order to be enemies of the Republic. Then he announced that the Galactic Republic would become a Galactic Empire so strong as to never be threatened by outside forces again:</p>
<p>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>Palpatine, who by this time had been grotesquely disfigured (he claimed this was from the Jedi assassination attempt), proclaimed himself to be the first Emperor of the galaxy. Deluded by Palpatine&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Charisma" id="w">charisma</a> and skill (and perhaps also by his considerable <a href="/wiki/Dark_side_(Star_Wars)" id="w">dark side</a> power), the majority of the Senate cheered him on loudly in approval, which provoked one of Senator Padmé Amidala&#39;s most memorable lines: <i>&#34;So this is how liberty dies: with thunderous applause.&#34;</i> After so many millennia, the Galactic Republic had ceased to exist.</p> 
<p>The Senate continued to exist after the formation of the Empire, as the Imperial Senate, but it was a virtually powerless advisory council. Palpatine remained the final authority on all laws; at most, the Senate could simply delay and discuss legislation. As the Clone Wars were winding down, however, Palpatine&#39;s once near-unanimous support began to falter. As depicted in the <i><a href="/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Sith" id="w">Revenge of the Sith</a></i> novelization and deleted scenes from the film itself, a bloc of senators began to emerge, even before the Clone Wars had ended, who opposed the Emperor&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Authoritarian" id="w">authoritarian</a> rule and resented his treatment of the Jedi and other opponents. This bloc, originally led by influential politicians such as Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, and later by Bail&#39;s foster daughter <a href="/wiki/Princess_Leia" id="w">Princess Leia Organa</a>, eventually became the political voice of the emerging <a href="/wiki/Rebel_Alliance" id="w">Rebel Alliance</a>.  </p>
<p>Decades later, shortly before the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Yavin" id="w">Battle of Yavin</a>, Palpatine found the continued existence of open political <a href="/wiki/Dissent" id="w">dissent</a> a hindrance to his total control, and disbanded the Imperial Senate &#8212; sweeping away the last remnants of the Galactic Republic. He formally placed all power of governance in the hands of the regional governors of the Imperial Military, thus abolishing civilian control of government. In truth, however, the real power had rested with the regional governors for some time. The Senate Building, however, still remained visible on the Coruscant skyline at the time of the destruction of the Second <a href="/wiki/Death_Star" id="w">Death Star</a>.</p>
