The <b>culture of Portugal</b> is rooted in the <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> culture of <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">Ancient Rome</a>, with a <a href="/wiki/Celtiberians" id="w">Celtiberian</a> background (a mixture of pre-Roman <a href="/wiki/Celts" id="w">Celts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Iberians" id="w">Iberians</a>). </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portugal</a>, as a country with a long history full of influences from external peoples, is home to magnificent architectural structures (from prehistory onwards), as well as superb art, furniture and literary collections mirroring and chronicling the events that shaped the country and its peoples. The Portuguese have a large number of cultural landmarks ranging from <a href="/wiki/Museum" id="w">museums</a> to ancient <a href="/wiki/Church" id="w">church</a> buildings to medieval <a href="/wiki/Castle" id="w">castles</a>, which testify the national cultural heritage. </p>
<p>There are many diverse cultural activities in which the Portuguese participate, indulging their appreciation of art, music, drama and dance. Portugal has a rich traditional <a href="/wiki/Folklore" id="w">folklore</a> (<i>Ranchos Folclóricos</i>), with great regional variety. Many towns have a museum and a collection of ancient monuments and buildings. Many places have at least a cinema, some venues to listen to music and locations to see arts and crafts. In the larger cities visits to the theatre, concerts or galleries of modern exhibitions are popular, and Portugal can boast not only international-scale venues in <a href="/wiki/Lisbon" id="w">Lisbon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Porto" id="w">Porto</a>, but also many acclaimed artists from various disciplines. The importance of the arts is illustrated by the fact that on the death of <a href="/wiki/Am%C3%A1lia_Rodrigues" id="w">Amália Rodrigues</a>, the &#34;Queen of Fado&#34; (<a href="/wiki/Fado" id="w">fado</a> is Portugal&#39;s national music) in October 1999, three days of national mourning was declared. In 1998, <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Saramago" id="w">José Saramago</a>, one of Portugal&#39;s well-known writers, was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize" id="w">Nobel Prize</a> for literature. In 2001, Porto was <a href="/wiki/European_Capital_of_Culture" id="w">European Capital of Culture</a>, contributing to a current renaissance in artistic creation, and in 2004 Portugal hosted the <a href="/wiki/Euro_2004" id="w">European football finals</a> in specially constructed stadia. </p>
<p>In smaller towns and villages, cultural activity may revolve around local folklore, with musical groups performing traditional dance and song. Local festivities are very popular during the summer season in all sort of localities ranging from villages to cities, as well as <a href="/wiki/Beach" id="w">beach</a> holidays from June to September. Portuguese people in the major towns and almost all cities like to go shopping in malls which are generally well equipped with modern facilities and offer a wide variety of attractions ranging from shops and stores of the most renowned brands to cinemas, restaurants and hypermarkets. <a href="/wiki/Caf%C3%A9" id="w">Café</a> culture is also regarded as an important cultural feature of the Portuguese. As the most popular sport, <a href="/wiki/Football_in_Portugal" id="w">football events</a> involving major Portuguese teams are always widely followed with great enthusiasm. There are still some <a href="/wiki/Bullring" id="w">bullrings</a> in Portugal, although the passion for <a href="/wiki/Portuguese-style_bullfighting" id="w">bullfighting</a> is not as widespread as in neighbouring <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>.</p>

<p>{{main}}
Portuguese musical traditions are diverse and dynamic, they reflect multifarious historical, cultural, and political processes with influences from non-European cultures from both North and sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil.</p>
<p>Polyphonic music, employing multiple vocal parts in harmony, was developed in the 15th century. The Renaissance fostered a rich output of compositions for solo instruments and ensembles as well as for the voice. </p>
<p>The 1960s started a period of expansion and innovation with pop, rock and jazz introduced and evolving, political song developed, the <a href="/wiki/Fado" id="w">fado</a> of Lisbon and the Coimbra were revitalized. Music from the former African colonies and Brazil occupied an increasingly important place in the capital’s musical life and local styles of rap and hip hop emerged.</p>
<p>The modern revival of academic music was primarily work of Luís de Freitas Branco, and continued by Joly Braga Santos. Composers like António Victorino d&#39;Almeida, Jorge Peixinho, Miguel Azguime, Pedro Amaral, and João Pedro Oliveira are known internationally. Orchestras include the <a href="/wiki/Orquestra_Sinf%C3%B3nica_Portuguesa" id="w">Orquestra Sinfónica Portuguesa</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Gulbenkian_Orchestra" id="w">Gulbenkian Orchestra</a>. <a href="/wiki/Oporto" id="w">Oporto</a> has had its own symphony orchestra since 1962, when the Chamber Orchestra was set up by the Gulbenkian Foundation. Lisbon also has a metropolitan orchestra, and the <a href="/wiki/National_Theatre_of_S%C3%A3o_Carlos" id="w">National Theatre of São Carlos</a> in Lisbon, which was built in the late 18th century, has its own orchestra and ballet company. Among notable pianists, Maria João Pires has won worldwide acclaim.</p>
<p>Cultural centres such as the Belém Cultural Centre and the Culturgest, both in Lisbon, have expanded opportunities for major concerts. Madredeus is among the most successful popular music groups. Singer Dulce Pontes is also widely admired, and Carlos Paredes is considered by many to be Portugal&#39;s finest guitarist. Folk music and dancing and the traditional fado remain the country&#39;s fundamental forms of musical expression.</p>

<b>Fado</b> (translated as <a href="/wiki/Destiny" id="w">destiny</a> or <a href="/wiki/Fate" id="w">fate</a>) is a <a href="/wiki/Music_genre" id="w">music genre</a> which can be traced from the <a href="/wiki/1820s" id="w">1820s</a>, but probably with much earlier origins. It is characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor. The music is usually linked to the <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_language" id="w">Portuguese</a> word <i><a href="/wiki/Saudade" id="w">saudade</a></i>, a unique word with no accurate translation in any other language . (<a href="/wiki/Home-sickness" id="w">Home-sickness</a> has an approximate meaning. It is a kind of longing, and conveys a complex mixture of mainly nostalgia, but also sadness, pain, happiness and love). Some enthusiasts claim that Fado&#39;s origins are a mixture of <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">African</a> <a href="/wiki/Slavery" id="w">slave</a> rhythms with the traditional music of Portuguese sailors and <a href="/wiki/Arabic_music" id="w">Arabic</a> influence.</p>
<p>There are two main varieties of fado, namely those of the cities of <a href="/wiki/Lisbon" id="w">Lisbon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coimbra" id="w">Coimbra</a>. The Lisbon style is the most popular, while Coimbra&#39;s is the more refined style. Modern fado is popular in Portugal, and has produced many renowned <a href="/wiki/List_of_fado_musicians" id="w">musicians</a>. According to tradition, to applaud fado in Lisbon you clap your hands, in Coimbra you cough as if clearing your throat.</p>
<p>Mainstream fado performances during the 20th century included only a singer, a <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_guitar" id="w">Portuguese guitar</a> player and a classical guitar player but more recent settings range from singer and string quartet to full orchestra.</p>
<p>The ingredients of Fado are a shawl, a guitar, a voice and heartfelt emotion.</p>
<p>Themes include: destiny, deep-seated feelings, disappointments in love, the sense of sadness and longing for someone who has gone away, misfortune, the ups and downs of life, the sea, the life of sailors and fishermen, and last but not least &#34;Saudade&#34; (one of the main themes used in fado, that means a kind of longing).</p>
<p>Fado is probably the oldest urban folk music in the world and represents the heart of the Portuguese soul, and for that matter fado performance is not successful if an audience is not moved to tears.</p>
<a id="Portuguese_rock" name="Portuguese_rock"></a><h4>Portuguese rock</h4>
<p>{{Main}}
The Portuguese rock started to be noted in 1980 with the release of Ar de Rock by <a href="/wiki/Rui_Veloso" id="w">Rui Veloso</a>, which was the first popular Portuguese rock song. Before that, Portugal had a vibrant underground progressive rock scene in the 1970s. Among the numerous bands and artists which followed its genesis, are <a href="/wiki/Xutos_%26amp%3B_Pontap%C3%A9s" id="w">Xutos &#38; Pontapés</a>, <a href="/wiki/GNR_(band)" id="w">GNR</a>, <a href="/wiki/UHF_(band)" id="w">UHF</a> and <a href="/wiki/Moonspell" id="w">Moonspell</a>.</p>
<a id="Traditional_music" name="Traditional_music"></a><h4>Traditional music</h4>
<p>In all the times and all places mankind always showed great ingenuity making sound and music from existing materials in its natural environment. The voice and the clapping of hands can certainly be considered the first instrumental forms used by man.</p>
<p>The Iberian Peninsula was home to a lot of different peoples and cultures, so its normal to these cultures to influence the others but still retain a little of their aspects - this happened with the <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_music" id="w">Portuguese music</a>. Even in the present one can find types of instruments from different places, such as the <a href="/wiki/Bagpipes" id="w">bagpipes</a> and the Arab <a href="/wiki/Adufe" id="w">adufe</a>, but they are now and forever a part of the Portuguese culture. From the <i>Pauliteiros de Miranda</i> in the <a href="/wiki/Terra_de_Miranda" id="w">Terra de Miranda</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Corridinho" id="w">Corridinho</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Algarve" id="w">Algarve</a>, the traditional music and songs transpire a poetic character that tells the history of a community to other people and generations to come.</p>

<a id="Popular_music" name="Popular_music"></a><h4>Popular music</h4>
<p>The 1980s and 1990s were marked by the search for a new musical discourse in urban popular music, the increase, commodification and industrialization of musical production, and the mediatization and expansion of music consumption. The boom in Portuguese musical production was accompanied by both the diversification of the musical domains and styles produced and consumed in Portugal and the emergence of new styles which are increasingly taking the global market into account. The denominated Pop music uses melodies easily to memorize, becoming very popular and commercial; it’s also characterized by the amount of publicity made (through videos, magazines, appealing clothing, etc).</p>
<p>It is possible to note two stylistic tendencies in the popular music of the 1980s and 1990s:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A musical discourse created by Portuguese musicians that is integrated within the major international developments experienced by commercial popular music;</li>
<li>A new musical style that vindicates its Portugueseness by both drawing upon various musical elements which musicians and audiences alike identify as Portuguese and emphasizing the Portuguese language.</li></ul>
<a id="Folk" name="Folk"></a><h4>Folk</h4>
<p>Folk music is the joint of the traditional songs of a community that express through a poetic character their beliefs and tell their history to other people and generations. The danças do vira (Minho), Pauliteiros de Miranda (Miranda), Corridinho do Algarve or Bailinho (Madeira), are some examples of dances created by the sound of folk. Some of the typical instruments used are a little guitar, bagpipes, accordion, violin, drums, Portuguese guitar and an enormous variety of wind and percussion instruments. </p>
<a id="Philharmonic_music" name="Philharmonic_music"></a><h4>Philharmonic music</h4>
<p>In the popular culture the philharmonic bands represent each locality and play different types of music, from popular to classical. Lidia Costa, Carlos Marques, Alberto Madurai, José Caminos and Railcar Morays are some of the most important names in philharmonic music.</p>
<a id="Can%C3%A7%C3%B5es_de_interven%C3%A7%C3%A3o_(political_songs)" name="Can%C3%A7%C3%B5es_de_interven%C3%A7%C3%A3o_(political_songs)"></a><h4>Canções de intervenção (political songs)</h4>
<p>Political songs (canções de intervenção) played an important part in the protests against the totalitarian regime that ruled Portugal from 1926 up to the 1974 revolution. Once it was created as an object to criticize what was wrong, mainly in a political point of view. One of its main protagonists was José (Zeca) Afonso (1929-1987) but others also contributed to its development, for example Adriano Correia de Oliveira, José Mário Branco, Luís Cilia, Francisco Fanhais, José Jorge Letria, José Barata Moura and Sérgio Godinho. They traced a new course for urban popular music and influenced a further generation of musicians, some of whom also participated in the protest movement and are still active, including Fausto, Vitorino, Janita Salomé and Júlio Pereira, among others.</p>
<p>This musical style reflects a confluence of influences from traditional music, French urban popular songs of the 1960s, African music and Brazilian popular music. By the late 1970s the revolutionary climate had subsided and the need to express political militancy through song was no longer felt by poets, composers and singers, who subsequently redefined both their role and their creative contribution.</p>
<a id="Classical_music" name="Classical_music"></a><h4>Classical music</h4>
<p>Portugal has been an important centre of practice and production of music over the centuries, as the <a href="/wiki/Music_history_of_Portugal" id="w">music history of Portugal</a> expresses. In contemporary classical music, notable Portuguese musicians include the piano players Artur Pizarro, Maria João Pires e Sequeira Costa, and the composers: Fernando Lopes-Graça, Emmanuel Nunes, João Pedro Oliveira, Jorge Peixinho, Constança Capdeville, Clotilde Rosa, Fernando Corrêa de Oliveira, Cláudio Carneyro, Frederico de Freitas, Joly Braga Santos and Isabel Soveral.</p>

<a href="/wiki/Hip_hop" id="w">Hip hop</a> has been important since the 1980s with areas like Chelas, Amadora, Cacém and the South Bank of the Tagus are considered to be the cradle of <a href="/wiki/Hip_Hop_Tuga" id="w">Hip Hop Tuga</a>.</p>
<p>The album called &#34;Rapublica&#34; released in 1994 by <a href="/wiki/Black_Company" id="w">Black Company</a> established hip hop in Portugal. The refrain from a song called &#34;Não sabe nadar, yo&#34; (&#34;Cant swim, yo!&#34;) was used by the president of Portugal, <a href="/wiki/Mario_Soares" id="w">Mario Soares</a> in a speech about the cave painting in Foz Côa saying that &#34;As gravuras não sabem nadar, yo!&#34; (&#34;The paintings can’t swim, yo!&#34;).</p>

Its first edition in 2005 carded Rodney P, NBC, Blackmastah, Bomberjack, Rui Miguel Abreu, etc. Usually the event is held outdoors, but in 2006 the heavy rains made the event relocate to the parking lot of the building, causing a really &#34;underground&#34; look.</p>

<a id="Painting" name="Painting"></a><h3>Painting</h3>
<p>Portuguese art was very restricted in the early years of nationality, during the <a href="/wiki/Reconquista" id="w">reconquista</a>, to a few paintings in churches, convents and palaces.</p>
<p><div style="wigth:120px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:120px-St-vin.jpg" title="&#39;&#39;St. Vicent Panels (detail)&#39;&#39; by Nuno Gonçalves"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120px-St-vin.jpg" alt="&#39;&#39;St. Vicent Panels (detail)&#39;&#39; by Nuno Gonçalves" title="&#39;&#39;St. Vicent Panels (detail)&#39;&#39; by Nuno Gonçalves" class="location-none type-thumb" width="120px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption"><i>St. Vicent Panels (detail)</i> by Nuno Gonçalves</div></div>
</p>
<p>It was after the <a href="/wiki/15th_century" id="w">15th century</a>, with national borders established and with the discoveries, that Portuguese art expanded. Some kings, like <a href="/wiki/John_of_Portugal" id="w">John I</a> already had royal painters. It is during this century that Gothic art was replaced by a more humanistic and Italian-like art.</p>
<p>During the reign of King <a href="/wiki/Alfonso_V_of_Portugal" id="w">Alfonso V</a>, an important Portuguese artist <a href="/wiki/Nuno_Gon%C3%A7alves" id="w">Nuno Gonçalves</a> shaped Portuguese art, leading it to gain local characteristics (<i>Escola Nacional</i>, National School). His influence on Portuguese art continued after his death. He was the royal painter for the famous <i>Retábulo do Altar das Relíquias de São Vicente</i> in the Cathedral of Lisbon (<i>Sé de Lisboa</i>). The painting caught fire and was replaced by a Baroque structure. Parts of his work still exist and can be found in the <i>Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga National</i> (Museum of Ancient Art).</p>
<p>During the Golden Age of Portugal, in the late <a href="/wiki/15th_century" id="w">15th century</a> and early <a href="/wiki/16th_century" id="w">16th century</a>, Portuguese artists were influenced by Flemish art, and were in turn influential on Flemish artists of the same period. During this period, Portuguese art became internationally well-known, mostly because of its very original and diverse characteristics, but little is known about the artists of this time due to the medieval culture that considered painters to be artisans. The anonymous artists in the Portuguese &#34;escolas&#34; produced art not only for metropolitan Portugal but also for its colonies, namely <a href="/wiki/Malacca" id="w">Malacca</a> or <a href="/wiki/Goa" id="w">Goa</a> and even <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a>, gratifying the desires of local aristrocatic clients and religious clients.</p>
<p>In the 19th century naturalist and realist painters like <a href="/wiki/Columbano_Bordalo_Pinheiro" id="w">Columbano</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henrique_Pous%C3%A3o" id="w">Henrique Pousão</a> and <a href="/wiki/Silva_Porto" id="w">Silva Porto</a> revitalized painting against a decadent academic art.</p>
<p>In the early <a href="/wiki/20th_century" id="w">20th century</a> <a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portuguese</a> art increased both in quality and quantity, mainly due to members of the <a href="/wiki/Modernist" id="w">Modernist</a> movement like <a href="/wiki/Amadeo_de_Souza_Cardoso" id="w">Amadeo de Souza Cardoso</a> and <a href="/wiki/Almada_Negreiros" id="w">Almada Negreiros</a>. In the post-war years the abstractionist painter <a href="/wiki/Vieira_da_Silva" id="w">Vieira da Silva</a> settled in Paris and gained widespread recognition, as did his contemporary <a href="/wiki/Paula_Rego" id="w">Paula Rego</a>.</p>
<a id="Theatre" name="Theatre"></a><h3>Theatre</h3>
<p>Portugal never developed a great Dramatic theatre tradition due primarily to the fact that the Portuguese were more passionate about lyric or humorous works than dramatic art. <a href="/wiki/Gil_Vicente" id="w">Gil Vicente</a> is often seen has the father of Portuguese theatre - he was the leading Portuguese <a href="/wiki/Playwright" id="w">playwright</a> in the <a href="/wiki/16th_century" id="w">16th century</a>. During the <a href="/wiki/20th_century" id="w">20th century</a>, theatre found a way to reach out to the people, specially the middle class, through what in Portugal is known as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Revista" id="w">Revista</a>&#34; - a form of humorous and cartoonish theatre designed to expose and criticize social (and political) issues, but in a way that entertains and amuses the audience.</p>
<p>Gil Vicente (1435-1536) is considered the first great Portuguese playwright. Frequently called the father of Portuguese theatre, he portrays the society of the 16th century. Anticipating the seventeenth-century French writer <a href="/wiki/Santeuil" id="w">Santeuil</a>&#39;s well-known phrase &#34;castigat ridendo mores&#34;, Gil Vicente became famous for his satirical plays such as the &#34;Triologia das Barcas&#34; (&#34;Auto da Barca do Inferno&#34; (1517), &#34;Auto da Barca do Purgatório&#34; (1518); &#34;Auto da Barca da Glória&#34; (1518)). In these plays, he creates some characters who are representative of their social group. This results in not only comical, but also strong critical situations. Gil Vicente also wrote other important plays such as &#34;Auto da Índia&#34; (1509), &#34;Auto da Fama&#34; (1510), and &#34;Farsa de Inês Pereira&#34; (1523).</p>
<p>Another relevant playwright of the 16th century is António Ferreira (1528-1569), who wrote &#34;A Castro&#34; (1587), a well-known tragedy about the forbidden love between D. Pedro I and D. <a href="/wiki/In%C3%AAs_de_Castro" id="w">Inês de Castro</a>. António Ferreira is considered the father of Renaissance culture in Portugal.</p>
<p>One of the most famous playwrights of the 18th century is António José da Silva (1705-1739), commonly known as &#34;O Judeu&#34; because of his Judaic origins. He wrote several plays such as &#34;Os Encantos de Medeia&#34; (1735), &#34;As Variedades de Proteu&#34; (1737) and &#34;Precipício de Faetonte&#34; (1738).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Almeida_Garrett" id="w">Almeida Garrett</a> (1799-1854) was a turning point in Portuguese literature as far as the themes are concerned. His most outstanding play is &#34;Frei Luís de Sousa&#34; (1844), which became a classic of Portuguese theatre. Garrett also wrote &#34;Um Auto de Gil Vicente&#34; (1838), &#34;Filipa de Vilhena&#34; (1846) and &#34;O Alfageme de Santarém&#34; (1842). These three plays as well as &#34;Frei Luís de Sousa&#34; are somehow connected with Portuguese history. Furthermore, Garrett is also the founder of the &#34;Conservatório Geral de Arte Dramática&#34; as well as of the &#34;Teatro Nacional D. Maria II&#34;.</p>
<p>As far as the 20th century is concerned, it’s worth noticing Bernardo Santareno’s (1920-1980) work. His most famous play is &#34;O Judeu&#34;, based upon the life of António José da Silva, mentioned above. Santareno also wrote &#34;A Promessa&#34; (1957), &#34;O Crime da Aldeia Velha&#34; (1959) and &#34;Anunciação&#34; (1962). Most of his plays deal with universal questions such as liberty, oppression and discrimination.</p>
<p>Born in 1926, Luís de Sttau Monteiro (1926-1993) wrote several plays, some of them portraying and criticising Portuguese society of his time. His most famous play is &#34;Felizmente Há Luar&#34; (1961), which is a strong criticism of the political context of that time (dictatorship – Estado Novo). &#34;O Barão&#34; (1965), &#34;A Guerra Santa&#34; (1967) and &#34;Sua Excelência&#34; (1971) were also written by Sttau Monteiro.</p>
<p>In the 20th century theatre in Portugal became more popular with the &#34;Revista&#34; – a comical and satirical form of theatre. It is a creative way of expressing one’s ideas as well as criticising political and social problems. The most important actors who performed this form of theatre in the 20th century were Vasco Santana (1898-1958), Beatriz Costa (1907-1996) and Ivone Silva (1935-1987). Nowadays it is worth mentioning Maria João Abreu, José Raposo and Fernando Mendes, who perform this form of theatre at the well known &#34;Parque Mayer&#34; (a theatre in Lisbon where the &#34;Revista&#34; used to be performed).</p>
<p>Important Portuguese actors are <a href="/wiki/Ruy_de_Carvalho" id="w">Ruy de Carvalho</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eunice_Mu%C3%B1oz" id="w">Eunice Muñoz</a>, Rui Mendes, Irene Cruz, <a href="/wiki/Lu%C3%ADs_Miguel_Cintra" id="w">Luís Miguel Cintra</a>, just to name a few.</p>
<p>In later years,  theatre in Portugal has developed into many other forms as in any other European country. Almost every repertoire can be seen in Portugal. Many companies have the works of Shakespeare, Moliere, Brecht, Becket or Chekov, and Portuguese classic and modern authors on their repertoire. Other companies show  more experimental projects. All this makes the theatre reprtoire very varied. Some of the most important professional theatre companies nowadays are: <a href="/wiki/Teatro_da_Cornuc%C3%B3pia" id="w">Teatro da Cornucópia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Teatro_da_Comuna" id="w">Teatro da Comuna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Teatro_Aberto" id="w">Teatro Aberto</a>, <a href="/wiki/Teatro_Meridional" id="w">Teatro Meridional</a>, <a href="/wiki/Teatro_da_Garagem" id="w">Teatro da Garagem</a>, <a href="/wiki/Companhia_de_Teatro_de_Almada" id="w">Companhia de Teatro de Almada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Companhia_Teatral_do_Chiado" id="w">Companhia Teatral do Chiado</a>, <a href="/wiki/A_Barraca" id="w">A Barraca</a>, Teatro dos Aloés, Teatro Praga, Artistas Unidos, Seiva Trupe, As boas raparigas, ACTA, among many others.</p>
<p>Portugal hosts several festivals such as FIAR, ACERT and FITEI, and one of the most important is <a href="/wiki/Festival_Internacional_de_Teatro_de_Almada" id="w">Festival Internacional de Teatro de Almada</a> (International Theatre Festival of Almada), organized for 25 years by Companhia de Teatro de Almada (Almada Thetare Company), with directors <a href="/wiki/Joaquim_Benite" id="w">Joaquim Benite</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vitor_Gon%C3%A7alves" id="w">Vitor Gonçalves</a>.</p>

<a id="Festivities_and_holidays" name="Festivities_and_holidays"></a><h2>Festivities and holidays</h2>
<p>During the summer, in the month of June, festivities dedicated to three saints known as <i>Santos Populares</i> take place all over Portugal. Why the populace associated the saints to these pagan festivities is not known. But they are possibly related to Roman or local deities from the time before Christianity spread in the region. The three saints are <a href="/wiki/Anthony_of_Padua" id="w">Saint Anthony</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_the_Apostle" id="w">Saint John</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saint_Peter" id="w">Saint Peter</a>. Common fare in these festivities are wine, <i>água-pé</i> (mostly grape juice), and traditional bread along with sardines. During the festivities are many weddings, traditional street dances and fireworks.</p>
<p>Saint Anthony is celebrated on the night of 12th-13th of June, especially in <a href="/wiki/Lisbon" id="w">Lisbon</a> (where that saint was born and lived most of his life), with <i>Marchas Populares</i> (a street carnival) and other festivities. In the meantime, several marriages known as <i>Casamentos de Santo António</i> (Marriages of Saint Anthony) are made. But the most popular saint is Saint John, he is celebrated in many cities and towns throughout the country on the night of the 23rd-24th, especially in <a href="/wiki/Porto" id="w">Porto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Braga" id="w">Braga</a>, where the sardines, <i><a href="/wiki/Caldo_verde" id="w">caldo verde</a></i> (traditional soup) and plastic hammers to hammer in another person&#39;s head for luck are indispensable. The final saint is Saint Peter, celebrated in the night of 28th-29th, especially in <a href="/wiki/P%C3%B3voa_de_Varzim" id="w">Póvoa de Varzim</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barcelos" id="w">Barcelos</a>, the festivities are similar to the others, but more dedicated to the sea and with an extensive use of fire (<i>fogueiras</i>). In Póvoa de Varzim, there is the <i>Rusgas</i> in the night, another sort of street carnival. Each festivity is a municipal holiday in the cities and towns where it occurs.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Carnival" id="w">Carnival</a> is also widely celebrated in Portugal, some traditional carnivals date back several centuries. <a href="/wiki/Loul%C3%A9" id="w">Loulé</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alcoba%C3%A7a" id="w">Alcobaça</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mealhada" id="w">Mealhada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ovar" id="w">Ovar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Figueira_da_Foz" id="w">Figueira da Foz</a>, hold several days of festivities, with parades where social and political criticism abound, along with music and dancing in an environment of euphorya. </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/January_6" id="w">January 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/Epiphany_(feast)" id="w">Epiphany</a> is celebrated by some families, especially in the North and Center, where the family gathers to eat &#34;<a href="/wiki/Bolo-Rei" id="w">Bolo-Rei</a>&#34; (literally, King Cake, a cake made with crystallized fruits); this is also the time for the traditional street songs - &#34;As Janeiras&#34; (The January ones). <a href="/wiki/Martin_of_Tours" id="w">Saint Martin Day</a>, is celebrated on <a href="/wiki/November_11" id="w">November 11</a>. This day is the peak of three days, often with very good weather, it is known as <i>Verão de São Martinho</i> (&#34;Saint Martin summer&#34;), the Portuguese celebrate it with <i>jeropiga</i> (a sweet liqueur wine) and roasted Portuguese <a href="/wiki/Chestnut" id="w">chestnuts</a> (<i>castanhas assadas</i>), and it is called <i>Magusto</i>.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">Football</a> is the most popular and practised sport in Portugal.</p>
<p>Football started to become well known in Portugal in the final decades of the 19th century, brought by Portuguese students who returned from England.</p>
<p>The first person responsible for its implementation would have been Guilherme Pinto Basto (according to some people, his brothers Eduardo and Frederico would have brought the first ball from England). It was he who had the initiative to organise an exhibition of the new game, which took place in October of 1888, and it was also him who organized the first football match in January of the following year. The match, played where today the <i>Campo Pequeno</i> bullring is located, involved opposing teams from Portugal and England. The Portuguese won the game 2-1. Consequently, football started attracting the attention of the high society, being distinguished by the Luso-British rivalry.</p>
<p>Later, the game spread, being practised in colleges and leading to the foundation of clubs all over the country. Until the end of the century, associations such as <i>Clube Lisbonense</i>, <i>Carcavelos</i>, <i>Braço de Prata</i>, the <i>Real Ginásio Clube Português</i>, the <i>Estrela Futebol Clube</i>, the <i>Futebol Académico</i>, the <i>Campo de Ourique</i>, the Oporto Cricket, and the <i>Sport Clube Vianense</i> were founded to practise this sport or created sections for competing.</p>
<p>The first match, between Lisbon and Porto, took place in 1894, attended by King D. Carlos.</p>
<p>The <i>Clube Internacional de Futebol</i> (founded in 1902) was the first Portuguese team to play abroad defeating, in 1907, the <i>Madrid Futebol Clube</i> in the Spanish capital.</p>
<p>Currently, of the most important teams of the sport in Portugal, the oldest is the <i>Boavista Futebol Clube</i>, which was founded in 1903. The <i>Futebol Clube do Porto</i>, after an unsuccessful attempt in 1893, appeared in 1906, stimulated by José Monteiro da Costa, among others. The <i>Sporting Clube de Portugal</i> was founded in 1906 by the Viscount of Alvalade and his grandson José de Alvalade. <i>Sport Lisboa e Benfica</i>, was born in 1904 (the club maintained the foundation date of <i>Sport Lisboa</i>, founded in 1904, when in 1908 assimilated the <i>Grupo Sport Benfica</i>, founded in 1906). They are all clubs that traditionally have several sports activities but they give great distinction to football, making use of teams of professional players, which frequently participate in European competitions.</p>
<p>In May 2006, the <a href="/wiki/Portugal_national_football_team" id="w">Portuguese national team</a> was <a href="/wiki/FIFA_World_Rankings" id="w">ranked 7th</a> out of 205 countries by <a href="/wiki/FIFA" id="w">FIFA</a>.
