<b><i>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/Trilogy" id="w">series of three novels</a> written by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Shea" id="w">Robert Shea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson" id="w">Robert Anton Wilson</a> purportedly between 1969 and 1971<sup id="_ref-written_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-written" title="">[1]</a></sup>, and first published in 1975. The trilogy is a <a href="/wiki/Satire" id="w">satirical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Postmodernism" id="w">postmodern</a>, <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a>-influenced adventure story; a <a href="/wiki/Psychoactive_drug" id="w">drug</a>-, <a href="/wiki/Human_sexuality" id="w">sex</a>- and <a href="/wiki/Magic_(paranormal)" id="w">magic</a>-laden trek through a number of <a href="/wiki/Conspiracy_theory" id="w">conspiracy theories</a>, both historical and imaginary, which hinge around the authors&#39; version of the <a href="/wiki/Illuminati" id="w">Illuminati</a>. The narrative often switches between <a href="/wiki/Narrator#Third person" id="w">third</a> and <a href="/wiki/Narrator#First person" id="w">first person</a> perspectives and jumps around in time. It is thematically dense, covering topics like <a href="/wiki/Counterculture" id="w">counterculture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Numerology" id="w">numerology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Discordianism" id="w">Discordianism</a>.</p>
<p>The trilogy comprises the books <i>The Eye in the Pyramid</i>, <i>The Golden Apple</i> and <i>Leviathan</i>. They were first published starting in September 1975, as three separate volumes, and in 1984 as an omnibus; they are now more commonly reprinted in the latter form. The trilogy won the <a href="/wiki/Prometheus_Award" id="w">Prometheus Hall of Fame Award</a>, designed to honor classic <a href="/wiki/Libertarianism" id="w">libertarian</a> fiction, in 1986.<sup id="_ref-award_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-award" title="">[2]</a></sup> The authors went on to create several works, both fiction and nonfiction, that further discussed the themes of the trilogy, but no direct sequels were produced. <i>Illuminatus!</i> has been adapted for the stage, and has influenced several modern writers, musicians and games-makers. The popularity of the word &#34;<a href="/wiki/Fnord" id="w">fnord</a>&#34; and the <a href="/wiki/23_(numerology)" id="w">23 enigma</a> can both be attributed to the trilogy. It remains a <a href="/wiki/Seminal_work" id="w">seminal work</a> of <a href="/wiki/Conspiracy_fiction" id="w">conspiracy fiction</a>, predating <i><a href="/wiki/Foucault%26%2339%3Bs_Pendulum_(book)" id="w">Foucault&#39;s Pendulum</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code" id="w">The Da Vinci Code</a></i> by decades.</p>
<a id="Narrative" name="Narrative"></a><h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>The plot meanders between the thoughts, <a href="/wiki/Hallucination" id="w">hallucinations</a> and inner voices (both real and imagined) of its many characters, as well as through time (past, present and future)&#8212;sometimes in mid-sentence. Much of the back story is explained via dialogue between characters, who recount unreliable, often mutually contradictory, versions of their supposed histories. There are even parts in the book where it actually reviews and jokingly <a href="/wiki/Deconstruction" id="w">deconstructs</a> itself.</p>

The trilogy&#39;s rambling story begins with an investigation by two <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> detectives (Saul Goodman and Barney Muldoon) into the bombing of <i>Confrontation</i>, a <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" id="w">leftist</a> magazine, and the disappearance of its editor, Joe Malik. Discovering the magazine&#39;s investigation into the <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination" id="w">John F. Kennedy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_assassination" id="w">Robert F. Kennedy</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr.#Assassination" id="w">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> assassinations, the two follow a trail of memos that suggest the involvement of powerful secret societies. They slowly become drawn into a web of conspiracy theories. Meanwhile, the magazine&#39;s reporter, George Dorn &#8211; having been turned loose without support deep in <a href="/wiki/Right-wing_politics" id="w">right-wing</a> Mad Dog, <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a> &#8211; is arrested for possession of drugs. He is jailed and physically threatened, at one point hallucinating about his own execution. The prison is bombed and he is bodily dragged into the hands of the <a href="/wiki/Discordianism" id="w">Discordians</a>, led by the enigmatic <a href="/wiki/Hagbard_Celine" id="w">Hagbard Celine</a>, captain of a golden submarine. Hagbard represents the Discordians in their eternal battle against the Illuminati, the conspiratorial organization that secretly controls the world. He finances his operations by smuggling illicit substances.</p>
<p>The plot meanders around the globe to such far-flung locations as <a href="/wiki/Las_Vegas%2C_Nevada" id="w">Las Vegas, Nevada</a> (where a potentially deadly, secret <a href="/wiki/Government_of_the_United_States" id="w">U.S. government</a>-developed mutated <a href="/wiki/Anthrax_disease" id="w">anthrax</a> epidemic has been accidentally unleashed); <a href="/wiki/Atlantis" id="w">Atlantis</a> (where Howard, the talking <a href="/wiki/Porpoise" id="w">porpoise</a>, and his porpoise aides help Hagbard battle the Illuminati); <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a> (where someone resembling <a href="/wiki/John_Dillinger" id="w">John Dillinger</a> was killed many years ago); and to the island of <a href="/wiki/Bioko" id="w">Fernando Poo</a> (the location of the next great <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" id="w">Cold War</a> standoff between <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Russia</a>, <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Republic_of_China" id="w">China</a> and the USA).</p>
<p>The evil scheme uncovered late in the tale is an attempt to <i><a href="/wiki/Immanentize_the_eschaton" id="w">immanentize the eschaton</a></i> (a catchphrase meaning &#34;bringing about the end of the world&#34; or &#34;creating heaven on earth&#34;, and derived from a quotation in the works of <a href="/wiki/Eric_Voegelin" id="w">Eric Voegelin</a>). Here it refers to the secret scheme of the <a href="/wiki/American_Medical_Association" id="w">American Medical Association</a>, an evil rock-and-roll band, to bring about a mass <a href="/wiki/Human_sacrifice" id="w">human sacrifice</a>, the purpose of which is the release of enough &#34;life-energy&#34; to give eternal life to a select group of initiates, including <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Adolf Hitler</a>. The AMA are four siblings who comprise four of the five mysterious Illuminati Primi. The identity of the fifth remains unknown for much of the trilogy. The first European &#34;<a href="/wiki/Woodstock_Festival" id="w">Woodstock</a>&#34; festival, held at <a href="/wiki/Ingolstadt" id="w">Ingolstadt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bavaria" id="w">Bavaria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>, is the chosen location for the sacrifice of the unwary victims, via the reawakening of hibernating <a href="/wiki/Nazism" id="w">Nazi</a> battalions from the bottom of nearby Lake Totenkopf. The plot is foiled when, with the help of a 50-foot-tall incarnation of the goddess <a href="/wiki/Eris_(mythology)" id="w">Eris</a>, the four members of the AMA are killed: Wilhelm is killed by the monstrous alien being <a href="/wiki/Yog-Sothoth" id="w">Yog-Sothoth</a>, Wolfgang is shot by John Dillinger, Winifred is drowned by porpoises, and Werner is trapped in a sinking car. </p>
<p>The major protagonists, now gathered together onboard the submarine, are menaced by the <a href="/wiki/Leviathan" id="w">Leviathan</a>, a giant, pyramid-shaped single-cell <a href="/wiki/Sea_monster" id="w">sea monster</a> that has been growing in size for hundreds of millions of years. The over-the-top nature of this encounter leads some of the characters to question whether they are merely characters in a book. This <a href="/wiki/Metafiction" id="w">metafictional</a> note is swiftly rejected (or ignored) as they turn their attention to the monster again. The threat is neutralized by offering up their onboard computer as something for the creature to communicate with to ease its loneliness. Finally, Hagbard Celine reveals himself as the fifth Illuminatus Primus â€” he has been toying with both sides and playing them off against each other in order to keep balance. He is a representative of the &#34;true&#34; Illuminati, whose aim is to spread the idea that everybody is free to do whatever they want at all times.</p>

The titles of the three volumes or parts (the front covers were titled <i>Illuminatus! Part I The Eye in the Pyramid</i>, <i>Illuminatus! Part II The Golden Apple</i> and <i>Illuminatus! Part III Leviathan</i>) refer to recurring symbols that relate to elements of the plot. <i>The Eye in the Pyramid</i> refers to the <a href="/wiki/Eye_of_Providence" id="w">Eye of Providence</a>, which in the novel represents in particular the <a href="/wiki/Bavarian_Illuminati" id="w">Bavarian Illuminati</a>, and makes a number of appearances (for example, as an altar and a tattoo).  <i>The Golden Apple</i> refers to the <a href="/wiki/Golden_apple" id="w">Golden apple</a> of discord, from the <a href="/wiki/Greek_mythology" id="w">Greek myth</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Judgement_of_Paris" id="w">Judgement of Paris</a>. In the trilogy it is used as the symbol of the Legion of Dynamic Discord, a <a href="/wiki/Discordian" id="w">Discordian</a> group; the golden apple makes a number of appearances, for example, on a <a href="/wiki/Anarchist_symbolism#Black flag" id="w">black flag</a>, and as an emblem on a uniform. <i>Leviathan</i> refers to the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Biblical</a> sea monster <a href="/wiki/Leviathan" id="w">Leviathan</a>, which is a potential danger to Hagbard&#39;s submarine <i>Leif Erickson</i> (from the name of the <a href="/wiki/Leif_Ericson" id="w">icelandic discoverer of America</a>).  </p>
<p>The three parts of the trilogy are subdivided into five &#34;books&#34; named after the five seasons of the <a href="/wiki/Discordian_calendar" id="w">Discordian calendar</a>. These books are also subdivided into ten &#34;trips&#34; named after the ten <a href="/wiki/Sephirot" id="w">Sephirot</a>. The last trip&#39;s conclusion is followed by fourteen appendices named after letters of the <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_Alphabet" id="w">Hebrew Alphabet</a>, which share their names with paths on the <a href="/wiki/Sephirot#Paths and Sephiroth" id="w">Tree of Life</a>. The first page of the Appendix includes this mysterious note: &#34;There were originally 22 appendices explaining the secrets of the Illuminati. Eight of the appendices were removed due to the paper shortage. They will be printed in heaven&#34;, while &#34;Appendix <a href="/wiki/Mem" id="w">Mem</a>&#34; states: &#34;Where are the missing eight appendices? Answer: Censored.&#34;  This appears to be another of the authors&#39; jokes, although it is true that eight letters of the Hebrew Alphabet are missing, and the publisher required the authors to cut 500 pages from the book.<sup id="_ref-eight_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eight" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Publishing_history" name="Publishing_history"></a><h2>Publishing history</h2>
<p>The trilogy was originally written between 1969 and 1971 while Wilson and Shea were both associate editors for <i><a href="/wiki/Playboy" id="w">Playboy</a></i> magazine. As part of the role, they dealt with correspondence from the general public on the subject of <a href="/wiki/Civil_liberties" id="w">civil liberties</a>, much of which involved paranoid rants about imagined conspiracies. The pair began to write a novel with the premise that &#34;all these nuts are right, and every single conspiracy they complain about really exists&#34;.<sup id="_ref-nuts_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nuts" title="">[4]</a></sup> In a 1980 interview given to the science fiction magazine <i>Starship</i>, Wilson suggested the novel was also an attempt to build a myth around <a href="/wiki/Discordianism" id="w">Discordianism</a>:

<p>There was no specific division of labor in the collaborative writing process, although Shea&#39;s writing tended towards <a href="/wiki/Melodrama" id="w">melodrama</a>, while Wilson&#39;s parts tended towards <a href="/wiki/Satire" id="w">satire</a>. Wilson states in a 1976 interview conducted by Neal Wilgus:
{{cquote}}
According to <a href="/wiki/Ken_Campbell_(actor)" id="w">Ken Campbell</a>, who created a stage adaptation of <i>Illuminatus!</i> with <a href="/wiki/Chris_Langham" id="w">Chris Langham</a>, the writing process was treated as a game of one-upmanship between the two co-authors, and was an enjoyable experience for both:  
{{cquote}}</p>
<p>The unusual end product did not appeal to publishers, and it took several years before anybody agreed to take it on. According to Wilson the division of <i>Illuminatus!</i> into three parts was a commercial decision of the publisher, not the authors, who had conceived it as a single continuous volume. Publishers Dell also required Shea and Wilson to cut 500 pages to reduce printing costs on what was seen as a risky venture,<sup id="_ref-starship_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-starship" title="">[5]</a></sup> although Wilson states that most of the ideas contained therein made it into his later works. The idea that the top secrets of the Illuminati were cut from the books because the printer decided to trim the number of pages is a joke typical of the trilogy.</p>
<p>Dell first released these individual editions (with covers illustrated by Carlos Victor) in the USA in <a href="/wiki/1975_in_literature" id="w">1975</a>, to favorable reviews and some commercial success. It became a cult favorite but did not cross over into large mainstream sales. In <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">Britain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sphere_Books" id="w">Sphere Books</a> released the individual editions (with different cover art) in <a href="/wiki/1978_in_literature" id="w">1978</a>. The individual editions sold steadily until <a href="/wiki/1984_in_literature" id="w">1984</a>, when the trilogy was republished in a single omnibus volume for the first time. This collected edition lost the &#34;what has gone before&#34; introduction to <i>The Golden Apple</i> and the &#34;Prologue&#34; to <i>Leviathan</i>.  Some of the material in that foreword, such as the self-destruct <a href="/wiki/Mynah" id="w">mynah</a> birds (taught to say &#34;Here, kitty-kitty-kitty!&#34;), appears nowhere else in the trilogy, likely a result of the 500 pages of cuts demanded by Dell. The omnibus edition gave a new lease of life to flagging sales, and became the most commonly available form of the trilogy from then on. </p>
<p>The trilogy was translated and published in <a href="/wiki/German_language" id="w">German</a>, again both as separate volumes (the three covers of which formed a <a href="/wiki/Tryptych" id="w">tryptych</a>) and an omnibus. The face of <a href="/wiki/J._R._%26quot%3BBob%26quot%3B_Dobbs" id="w">J. R. &#34;Bob&#34; Dobbs</a> was split across the first two volumes, despite the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_the_SubGenius" id="w">Church of the SubGenius</a> not being featured in the novel (although Wilson had become a member). The Church was founded by <i>Illuminatus!</i> fans, and the image of &#34;Bob&#34; is widely considered to be a representation of Wilson himself.<sup id="_ref-bob_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bob" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Themes" name="Themes"></a><h2>Themes</h2>
<p><i>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</i> covers a wide range of subjects within its 805 pages. These include discussions about mythology, current events, conspiracy theories and the <a href="/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos" id="w">Cthulhu Mythos</a>.

<div class="thumbcaption"><i>The Eye in the Pyramid</i> as represented by The Great Seal of the United States on a dollar bill</div>
Although the many conspiracy theories in the book are (presumably) imaginary, these are mixed in with enough truth to make them seem plausible. For example, the title of the first book, <i>The Eye in the Pyramid</i>, refers to the <a href="/wiki/Eye_of_Providence" id="w">Eye of Providence</a>, a mystical symbol which derives from the ancient Egyptian <a href="/wiki/Eye_of_Horus" id="w">Eye of Horus</a> and is rumored to be the symbol of the <a href="/wiki/Bavarian_Illuminati" id="w">Bavarian Illuminati</a>. Some of <a href="/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States" id="w">America&#39;s founding fathers</a> are alleged by conspiracy theorists to have been members of this sect.<sup id="_ref-fathers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fathers" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The books are loaded with references to the Illuminati, the <a href="/wiki/Argenteum_Astrum" id="w">Argenteum Astrum</a>, many and various <a href="/wiki/World_domination" id="w">world domination</a> plans, conspiracy theories and pieces of <a href="/wiki/Gnosticism" id="w">gnostic</a> knowledge. Many of the odder conspiracies in the book are taken from unpublished letters to <i><a href="/wiki/Playboy" id="w">Playboy</a></i> magazine, where the authors were working as <a href="/wiki/Associate_editor" id="w">associate editors</a> while they wrote the novels. Among the oddest, the suggestion that <a href="/wiki/Adam_Weishaupt" id="w">Adam Weishaupt</a>, founder of the Bavarian Illuminati, killed <a href="/wiki/George_Washington" id="w">George Washington</a> and took on his identity as <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President of the United States</a> is often noted in Illuminati-conspiracy discussion.<sup id="_ref-weishaupt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-weishaupt" title="">[8]</a></sup> Proponents of this theory point to Washington&#39;s portrait on the <a href="/wiki/United_States_one-dollar_bill" id="w">United States one-dollar bill</a>, which they suggest closely resembles the face of Weishaupt.</p>
<a id="Fnord" name="Fnord"></a><h3>Fnord</h3>
<p>{{Main}}
One of the most well-known concepts in the book is the <i><a href="/wiki/Fnord" id="w">fnord</a></i>, a word coined by the writers of <i><a href="/wiki/Principia_Discordia" id="w">Principia Discordia</a></i> and given meaning by Shea and Wilson for <i>Illuminatus!</i> which has since been adopted in numerous other contexts. It makes its first appearance in <i>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</i> without any explanation during an <a href="/wiki/LSD" id="w">acid</a> <a href="/wiki/Psychedelic_experience" id="w">trip</a> by Dr. Ignotum Per Ignotius and Joe Malik: &#34;The only good fnord is a dead fnord&#34;.<sup id="_ref-fnord_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fnord" title="">[9]</a></sup> Several other unexplained appearances follow. Only much later in the story is the secret revealed, when Malik is hypnotized by Hagbard Celine to recall suppressed memories of his first-grade teacher conditioning his class to ignore the fnords: &#34;If you don&#39;t see the fnord it can&#39;t eat you, don&#39;t see the fnord, don&#39;t see the fnord...&#34;<sup id="_ref-firstgrade_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-firstgrade" title="">[10]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>In the Shea/Wilson fictional construct, it is a type of <a href="/wiki/Subliminal_message" id="w">subliminal message</a> technique brought about by seeing the word in print: a word that the majority of the population since early childhood has been trained to ignore (and, of course, trained to forget both the training and the fact that they are ignoring it), but which they associate with a vague sense of unease. Upon seeing the word, readers experience a panic reaction. They then subconsciously suppress all memories of having seen the word, but the sense of panic remains. They therefore associate the unease with the news story they are reading. Fnords are scattered liberally in the text of newspapers and magazines, causing <a href="/wiki/Fear" id="w">fear</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anxiety" id="w">anxiety</a> in those following current events. However, there are no fnords in the <a href="/wiki/Advertisement" id="w">advertisements</a>, thus encouraging a <a href="/wiki/Consumerism" id="w">consumerist</a> society. <i>Fnord</i> magazine equated the fnords with a generalized effort to control and brainwash the populace. To &#34;see the fnords&#34; would imply an attempt to wrestle back individual autonomy.<sup id="_ref-fnord_mag_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fnord_mag" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is implied in the text that &#34;fnord&#34; is not the actual word used for this purpose, but rather a substitute, since anyone reading the book wouldn&#39;t be able to see the actual word.</p>
<p>Others have pointed out that fnord may instead/also be a symbol representing the &#34;is&#34; of identity condemned by <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski" id="w">Alfred Korzybski</a>.<sup id="_ref-Beyond_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Beyond" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Numerology" name="Numerology"></a><h3>Numerology</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Numerology" id="w">Numerology</a> is given great credence by many of the characters, with the  <a href="/wiki/Discordianism#The Law of Fives" id="w">Law of Fives</a> in particular being frequently mentioned.  Hagbard Celine states the Law of Fives in Appendix Gimmel: &#34;All phenomena are directly or indirectly related to the number five.&#34;  Another character, Simon Moon, identifies what he calls the &#34;<a href="/wiki/23_(numerology)" id="w">23 synchronicity principle</a>&#34;, which he credits <a href="/wiki/William_S._Burroughs" id="w">William S. Burroughs</a> as having discovered.<sup id="_ref-burroughs_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-burroughs" title="">[13]</a></sup>  Both laws involve finding significance in the appearance of the number, and in its &#34;presen[ce] <a href="/wiki/Esoteric" id="w">esoterically</a> because of its conspicuous <a href="/wiki/Exoteric" id="w">exoteric</a> absence.&#34;<sup id="_ref-esoteric_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-esoteric" title="">[14]</a></sup>  One of the reasons Moon finds 23 significant is because &#34;All the great anarchists died on the 23rd day of some month or other.&#34;  He also identifies a &#34;23/17 phenomenon.&#34;  They are both tied to the Law of Fives, he explains, because 2 + 3 = 5, and 1 + 7 = 8  = 2Â³.<sup id="_ref-squared_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-squared" title="">[15]</a></sup> Robert Anton Wilson claimed in a 1988 interview that &#34;23 is a part of the cosmic code. It&#39;s connected with so many <a href="/wiki/Synchronicity" id="w">synchronicities</a> and weird coincidences that it must mean something, I just haven&#39;t figured out yet what it means!&#34;.<sup id="_ref-radio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-radio" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Counterculture" name="Counterculture"></a><h3>Counterculture</h3>
<p>The books were written at the height of the late 1960s, and are infused with the popular <a href="/wiki/Counterculture" id="w">counterculture</a> ideas of that time. For instance, the <a href="/wiki/New_Age" id="w">New Age</a> slogan &#34;<a href="/wiki/Flower_power" id="w">flower power</a>&#34; is referenced via its German form, <i><a href="/wiki/Ewige_Blumenkraft" id="w">Ewige Blumenkraft</a></i> (literally &#34;eternal flower power&#34;), described by Shea and Wilson as a slogan of the Illuminati, the enemies of the <a href="/wiki/Hippy" id="w">hippy</a> ideal. The book&#39;s attitude to New Age philosophies and beliefs are ambiguous. Wilson explained in a later interview: &#34;I&#39;m some kind of antibody in the New Age movement. My function is to raise the possibility, hey, you know, some of this stuff might be bullshit.&#34;<sup id="_ref-pynchon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pynchon" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>The prevalence of <a href="/wiki/Kinky_sex" id="w">kinky sex</a> in the story reflects the hippy ideal of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Free_love" id="w">free love</a>&#34;; characters are both liberal-minded and promiscuous. The authors are well aware that it also provides an excuse for mere titillation: in a typically <a href="/wiki/Self-reference" id="w">self-referential</a> joke, a character in the story suggests the scenes exist: &#34;only to sell a bad book filled with shallow characters pushing a nonsense conspiracy&#34;. Similarly, the books espouse the use of <a href="/wiki/Psychoactive_drugs" id="w">mind-altering substances</a> to achieve higher states of consciousness, in line with the beliefs of key counterculture figures like <a href="/wiki/Timothy_Leary" id="w">Timothy Leary</a>. Leary himself called the trilogy &#34;more important than <i><a href="/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)" id="w">Ulysses</a></i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Finnegans_Wake" id="w">Finnegans Wake</a></i>&#34;. This quote is <a href="/wiki/Blurb" id="w">blurbed</a> on the covers or front page of its various printings.</p>
<a id="Cognitive_dissonance" name="Cognitive_dissonance"></a><h3>Cognitive dissonance</h3>

<p>Several protagonists come to the realization that they are merely fictional characters, or at least begin to question the reality of their situation. George Dorn wonders early on if he &#34;was in some crazy surrealist movie, wandering from telepathic sheriffs to homosexual assassins, to nympho lady Masons, to psychotic pirates, according to a script written in advance by two acid-heads and a Martian humorist&#34;.<sup id="_ref-dorn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dorn" title="">[20]</a></sup> Hagbard Celine claims towards the climax that the entire story is a computer-generated synthesis of random conspiracies: &#34;I can fool the rest of you, but I can&#39;t fool the reader. <a href="/wiki/FUCKUP" id="w">FUCKUP</a> has been working all morning, correlating all the data on this caper and its historical roots, and I programmed him to put it in the form of a novel for easy reading.

<a id="Allusions_to_other_works" name="Allusions_to_other_works"></a><h3>Allusions to other works</h3>
<p>For a work of fiction, <i>Illuminatus!</i> contains a lot of references to songs, films, articles, novels and other media.  This is partly because the characters themselves are involved in doing research, but it is also a trademark of Wilson&#39;s writing.  </p>
<p>The novel <i><a href="/wiki/Telemachus" id="w">Telemachus</a> Sneezed</i> by the character Atlanta Hope with its catchphrase &#34;What is John Guilt?&#34; is a spoof of <a href="/wiki/Ayn_Rand" id="w">Ayn Rand</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged" id="w">Atlas Shrugged</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-rand_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rand" title="">[22]</a></sup>  Ayn Rand is mentioned by name a few times in <i>Illuminatus!</i> herself, and her novel is alluded to by Hagbard who says, &#34;If Atlas can Shrug and Telemachus can Sneeze, why can&#39;t Satan Repent?&#34; Rand is also disparaged in one of the appendices concerning property, ostensibly written by Hagbard, which serves as an explanation of anarchist <a href="/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" id="w">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>&#39;s views on the subject.

<p>Wilson and Robert Shea went on to become prolific authors. While Shea concentrated mainly on historical novels, Wilson produced over 30 works, mixing fictional novels with nonfiction. Although both authors&#39; later work often elaborated on concepts first discussed in <i>Illuminatus!</i>, the pair never collaborated again. The trilogy inspired a number of direct adaptations, including a stage play and a comic book series, and numerous indirect adaptations that borrowed from its themes.  </p>
<a id="Shea_and_Wilson" name="Shea_and_Wilson"></a><h3>Shea and Wilson</h3>
<p>Wilson subsequently wrote a number of <a href="/wiki/Prequel" id="w">prequels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sequel" id="w">sequels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spin-off" id="w">spin-offs</a> based upon the <i>Illuminatus!</i> concept, including an incomplete <a href="/wiki/Pentalogy" id="w">pentalogy</a> called <i><a href="/wiki/The_Historical_Illuminatus_Chronicles" id="w">The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-radio_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-radio" title="">[16]</a></sup> a standalone work entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Masks_of_the_Illuminati" id="w">Masks of the Illuminati</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Illuminati_Papers" id="w">The Illuminati Papers</a></i>, in which several chapters are attributed to the trilogy&#39;s characters. Many of Wilson&#39;s other works, fictional and nonfictional, also make reference to the Illuminati or the <i>Illuminatus!</i> books. Several of the characters from <i>Illuminatus!</i>, for example, Markoff Chaney (&#34;The Midget&#34;) and Epicene Wildeblood, return in Wilson&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%26%2339%3Bs_Cat_trilogy" id="w">SchrÃ¶dinger&#39;s Cat trilogy</a></i>, which also carries on some of its themes.  The third book of the <i>Cat</i> trilogy, <i>The Homing Pigeons</i>, is actually mentioned as a sequel to <i>Illuminatus!</i> in &#34;Appendix Mem&#34;. In <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a>, Wilson published an encyclopedia of conspiracy theories called <i>Everything is Under Control</i>, which explains the origins of many of the theories mentioned in <i>Illuminatus!</i>. </p>
<p>Wilson and Shea did plan to collaborate again on a true sequel, <i>Bride of Illuminatus</i>, taking place in 2026. It was rumored that it would feature a resurrected Winifred Saure (the only female member of the American Medical Association) exerting her influence through <a href="/wiki/Virtual_reality" id="w">virtual reality</a>.<sup id="_ref-winifred_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-winifred" title="">[25]</a></sup> However, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Shea" id="w">Robert Shea</a> died in 1994 before this project came to fruition.  An excerpt was published in <a href="/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson" id="w">Robert Anton Wilson</a>&#39;s <i>Trajectories Newsletter: The Journal of Futurism and Heresy</i> in spring 1995.<sup id="_ref-trajectories_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trajectories" title="">[26]</a></sup>  In a 1994 interview for <i><a href="/wiki/FringeWare_Review" id="w">FringeWare Review</a></i>, Wilson suggested he may even &#34;do a Son of Illuminatus later&#34;.<sup id="_ref-fringe_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fringe" title="">[27]</a></sup> Curiously, in <i>Intelligence Agents</i> by Timothy Leary (1996)<sup id="_ref-leary_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-leary" title="">[28]</a></sup> he was credited with having already authored <i>Son of Illuminatus</i> in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Shea, meanwhile, never wrote another <i>Illuminatus!</i>-related book, although many of his later novels include references to the themes of that work. <a href="/wiki/Locus_Magazine" id="w">&#39;&#39;Locus&#39;&#39; magazine</a> describes Shea&#39;s <a href="/wiki/The_Saracen" id="w">Saracen</a> novels as &#34;Deep background for the <i>Illuminatus</i> trilogy&#34;.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
