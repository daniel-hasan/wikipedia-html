<p>The <b>history of biology</b> traces the study of the <a href="/wiki/Life" id="w">living world</a> from ancient to modern times. Although the concept of <i><a href="/wiki/Biology" id="w">biology</a></i> as a single coherent field arose in the 19th century, the biological sciences emerged from <a href="/wiki/History_of_medicine" id="w">traditions of medicine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Natural_history" id="w">natural history</a> reaching back to <a href="/wiki/Galen" id="w">Galen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" id="w">Aristotle</a> in ancient Greece. During the Renaissance and early modern period, biological thought was revolutionized by a renewed interest in <a href="/wiki/Empiricism" id="w">empiricism</a> and the discovery of many novel organisms. Prominent in this movement were <a href="/wiki/Vesalius" id="w">Vesalius</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Harvey" id="w">Harvey</a>, who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as <a href="/wiki/Carolus_Linnaeus" id="w">Linnaeus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Georges-Louis_Leclerc%2C_Comte_de_Buffon" id="w">Buffon</a> who began to <a href="/wiki/Scientific_classification" id="w">classify the diversity of life</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Fossil_record" id="w">fossil record</a>, as well as the development and behavior of organisms. <a href="/wiki/Microscopy" id="w">Microscopy</a> revealed the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for <a href="/wiki/Cell_theory" id="w">cell theory</a>. The growing importance of <a href="/wiki/Natural_theology" id="w">natural theology</a>, partly a response to the rise of <a href="/wiki/Mechanical_philosophy" id="w">mechanical philosophy</a>, encouraged the growth of natural history (although it entrenched the <a href="/wiki/Argument_from_design" id="w">argument from design</a>).</p>
<p>Over the 18th and 19th centuries, biological sciences such as <a href="/wiki/Botany" id="w">botany</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zoology" id="w">zoology</a> became increasingly professional <a href="/wiki/Scientific_discipline" id="w">scientific disciplines</a>. <a href="/wiki/Lavoisier" id="w">Lavoisier</a> and other physical scientists began to connect the animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as <a href="/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt" id="w">Alexander von Humboldt</a> investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography&#8212;laying the foundations for <a href="/wiki/Biogeography" id="w">biogeography</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ecology" id="w">ecology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ethology" id="w">ethology</a>. Naturalists began to reject <a href="/wiki/Essentialism" id="w">essentialism</a> and consider the importance of <a href="/wiki/Extinction" id="w">extinction</a> and the <a href="/wiki/History_of_evolutionary_thought" id="w">mutability of species</a>. <a href="/wiki/Cell_theory" id="w">Cell theory</a> provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as well as the results from <a href="/wiki/Embryology" id="w">embryology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paleontology" id="w">paleontology</a>, were synthesized in {{aps}}s theory of <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">evolution</a> by <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" id="w">natural selection</a>. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of <a href="/wiki/Spontaneous_generation" id="w">spontaneous generation</a> and the rise of the <a href="/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease" id="w">germ theory of disease</a>, though the mechanism of <a href="/wiki/Biological_inheritance" id="w">inheritance</a> remained a mystery.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of <a href="/wiki/Gregor_Mendel" id="w">Mendel&#39;s</a> work led to the rapid development of <a href="/wiki/Genetics" id="w">genetics</a> by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hunt_Morgan" id="w">Thomas Hunt Morgan</a> and his students, and by the 1930s the combination of <a href="/wiki/Population_genetics" id="w">population genetics</a> and natural selection in the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Modern_evolutionary_synthesis" id="w">neo-Darwinian synthesis</a>&#34;. New disciplines developed rapidly, especially after <a href="/wiki/James_D._Watson" id="w">Watson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Francis_Crick" id="w">Crick</a> proposed the structure of <a href="/wiki/DNA" id="w">DNA</a>. Following the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/Central_Dogma" id="w">Central Dogma</a> and the cracking of the <a href="/wiki/Genetic_code" id="w">genetic code</a>, biology was largely split between <i>organismal biology</i>&#8212;the fields that deal with whole organisms and groups of organisms&#8212;and the fields related to <i><a href="/wiki/Cell_biology" id="w">cellular</a> and <a href="/wiki/Molecular_biology" id="w">molecular biology</a></i>. By the late 20th century, new fields like <a href="/wiki/Genomics" id="w">genomics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Proteomics" id="w">proteomics</a> were reversing this trend, with organismal biologists using molecular techniques, and molecular and cell biologists investigating the interplay between genes and the environment, as well as the genetics of natural populations of organisms.</p>

<a id="Etymology_of_%22biology%22" name="Etymology_of_%22biology%22"></a><h1> Etymology of &#34;biology&#34;</h1>
<p>The word <i>biology</i> is formed by combining the <a href="/wiki/Greek_(language)" id="w">Greek</a> βίος (bios), meaning &#34;life&#34;, and the suffix &#39;-logy&#39;, meaning &#34;science of&#34;, &#34;knowledge of&#34;, &#34;study of&#34;, based on the Greek verb λεγειν, &#39;legein&#39; = &#34;to select&#34;, &#34;to gather&#34; (cf. the noun λόγος, &#39;logos&#39; = &#34;word&#34;). The term <i>biology</i> in its modern sense appears to have been introduced independently by <a href="/wiki/Karl_Friedrich_Burdach" id="w">Karl Friedrich Burdach</a> (in 1800), <a href="/wiki/Gottfried_Reinhold_Treviranus" id="w">Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus</a> (<i>Biologie oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur</i>, 1802) and <a href="/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck" id="w">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a> (<i>Hydrogéologie</i>, 1802).<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The word itself appears in the title of Volume 3 of {{aps}}s <i>Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae dogmaticae: Geologia, biologia, phytologia generalis et dendrologia</i>, published in 1766.</p>
<p>Before <i>biology</i>, there were several terms used for the study of animals and plants. <i><a href="/wiki/Natural_history" id="w">Natural history</a></i> referred to the descriptive aspects of biology, though it also included <a href="/wiki/Mineralogy" id="w">mineralogy</a> and other non-biological fields; from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance, the unifying framework of natural history was the <i>scala naturae</i> or <a href="/wiki/Great_Chain_of_Being" id="w">Great Chain of Being</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/Natural_philosophy" id="w">Natural philosophy</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Natural_theology" id="w">natural theology</a></i> encompassed the conceptual and metaphysical basis of plant and animal life, dealing with problems of why organisms exist and behave the way they do, though these subjects also included what is now <a href="/wiki/Geology" id="w">geology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Physics" id="w">physics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chemistry" id="w">chemistry</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Astronomy" id="w">astronomy</a>. Physiology and (botanical) pharmacology were the province of medicine. <i>Botany</i>, <i>zoology</i>, and (in the case of fossils) <i>geology</i> replaced <i>natural history</i> and <i>natural philosophy</i> in the 18th and 19th centuries before <i>biology</i> was widely adopted.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Up through the nineteenth century, the scope of biology was largely divided between medicine, which investigated questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of life and interactions among different forms of life and between life and non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history and (and its counterpart <a href="/wiki/Natural_philosophy" id="w">natural philosophy</a>) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines&#8212;<a href="/wiki/Cytology" id="w">cytology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bacteriology" id="w">bacteriology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" id="w">morphology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Embryology" id="w">embryology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Geography" id="w">geography</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Geology" id="w">geology</a>.</p>

The most significant evolutionary theory before Darwin&#39;s was that of <a href="/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck" id="w">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a>; based on the <a href="/wiki/Inheritance_of_acquired_characteristics" id="w">inheritance of acquired characteristics</a> (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> The British naturalist <a href="/wiki/Charles_Darwin" id="w">Charles Darwin</a>, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Malthus" id="w">Thomas Malthus&#39;s</a> writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" id="w">natural selection</a>; similar evidence lead <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace" id="w">Alfred Russel Wallace</a> to independently reach the same conclusions.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 1859 publication of Darwin&#39;s theory in <i><a href="/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species_by_Means_of_Natural_Selection%2C_or_the_Preservation_of_Favoured_Races_in_the_Struggle_for_Life" id="w">On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</a></i> is often considered the central event in the history of modern biology.

<p>Wallace, following on earlier work by <a href="/wiki/A.P._de_Candolle" id="w">de Candolle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alexander_von_Humbolt" id="w">Humbolt</a> and Darwin, made major contributions to <a href="/wiki/Zoogeography" id="w">zoogeography</a>.

His key question, as to why the fauna of islands with such similar climates should be so different, could only be answered by considering their origin. In 1876 he wrote <i>The geographical distribution of animals</i>, which was the standard reference work for over half a century, and a sequel, <i>Island Life</i>, in 1880 that focused on island biogeography. He extended the 6 zone system developed by <a href="/wiki/Philip_Sclater" id="w">Philip Sclater</a> for describing the geographical distribution of birds to animals of all kinds.

<p>Advances in <a href="/wiki/Microscopy" id="w">microscopy</a> also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the <a href="/wiki/Cell_(biology)" id="w">cell</a>. In 1838 and 1839, <a href="/wiki/Matthias_Jakob_Schleiden" id="w">Schleiden</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theodor_Schwann" id="w">Schwann</a> began promoting the ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of <a href="/wiki/Life" id="w">life</a>, though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of <a href="/wiki/Robert_Remak" id="w">Robert Remak</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Virchow" id="w">Rudolf Virchow</a>, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as <a href="/wiki/Cell_theory" id="w">cell theory</a>.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cell theory led biologists to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages of individual cells. Scientists in the rising field of <a href="/wiki/Cytology" id="w">cytology</a>, armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new <a href="/wiki/Staining" id="w">staining</a> methods, soon found that even single cells were far more complex than the homogeneous fluid-filled chambers of described by earlier microscopists. <a href="/wiki/Robert_Brown" id="w">Robert Brown</a> had described the <a href="/wiki/Cell_nucleus" id="w">nucleus</a> in 1831, and by the end of the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: <a href="/wiki/Chromosome" id="w">chromosomes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Centrosome" id="w">centrosomes</a> <a href="/wiki/Mitochondria" id="w">mitochondria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chloroplast" id="w">chloroplasts</a>, and other structures made visible through staining.

Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in <a href="/wiki/August_Weismann" id="w">August Weismann</a>&#39;s theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between <a href="/wiki/Somatic_cell" id="w">somatic cells</a> and <a href="/wiki/Germ_cell" id="w">germ cells</a> (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of <a href="/wiki/Meiosis" id="w">meiosis</a>), and adopted <a href="/wiki/Hugo_de_Vries" id="w">Hugo de Vries</a>&#39;s theory of <a href="/wiki/Pangene" id="w">pangenes</a>.

<p>In the early 20th century, naturalists were faced with increasing pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the <a href="/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycle" id="w">biogeochemical cycle</a> concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the <a href="/wiki/Quadrat" id="w">quadrat</a> and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the <a href="/wiki/Carnegie_Station_for_Experimental_Evolution" id="w">Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Marine_Biological_Laboratory" id="w">Marine Biological Laboratory</a> provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

<p>Biotechnology in the modern sense of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" id="w">genetic engineering</a> began in the 1970s, with the invention of <a href="/wiki/Recombinant_DNA" id="w">recombinant DNA</a> techniques. <a href="/wiki/Restriction_enzyme" id="w">Restriction enzymes</a> were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following on the heels of the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral <a href="/wiki/Genes" id="w">genes</a>. Beginning with the lab of <a href="/wiki/Paul_Berg" id="w">Paul Berg</a> in 1972 (aided by <i><a href="/wiki/EcoRI" id="w">EcoRI</a></i> from <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Boyer" id="w">Herbert Boyer&#39;s</a> lab, building on work with <a href="/wiki/Ligase" id="w">ligase</a> by <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Kornberg" id="w">Arthur Kornberg&#39;s</a> lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first <a href="/wiki/Transgenic_organisms" id="w">transgenic organisms</a>. Soon after, others began using <a href="/wiki/Plasmid" id="w">plasmid</a> <a href="/wiki/Vector_(biology)" id="w">vectors</a> and adding genes for <a href="/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance" id="w">antibiotic resistance</a>, greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wary of the potential dangers (particularly the possibility of a prolific bacteria with a viral cancer-causing gene), the scientific community as well as a wide range of scientific outsiders reacted to these developments with both enthusiasm and fearful restraint. Prominent molecular biologists led by Berg suggested a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA research until the dangers could be assessed and policies could be created. This moratorium was largely respected, until the participants in the 1975 <a href="/wiki/Asilomar_Conference_on_Recombinant_DNA" id="w">Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA</a> created policy recommendations and concluded that the technology could be used safely.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following Asilomar, new genetic engineering techniques and applications developed rapidly. <a href="/wiki/DNA_sequencing" id="w">DNA sequencing</a> methods improved greatly (pioneered by <a href="/wiki/Fred_Sanger" id="w">Fred Sanger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Walter_Gilbert" id="w">Walter Gilbert</a>), as did <a href="/wiki/Oligonucleotide" id="w">oligonucleotide</a> synthesis and <a href="/wiki/Transfection" id="w">transfection</a> techniques.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> Researchers learned to control the expression of <a href="/wiki/Transgene" id="w">transgenes</a>, and were soon racing&#8212;in both academic and industrial contexts&#8212;to create organisms capable of expressing human genes for the production of human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and <a href="/wiki/Splicing_(genetics)" id="w">splicing</a>, higher organisms had a much more complex system of <a href="/wiki/Gene_expression" id="w">gene expression</a> than the bacteria models of earlier studies.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> The first such race, for synthesizing human <a href="/wiki/Insulin" id="w">insulin</a>, was won by <a href="/wiki/Genentech" id="w">Genentech</a>. This marked the beginning of the biotech boom (and with it, the era of <a href="/wiki/Gene_patents" id="w">gene patents</a>), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>

<p>By the 1980s, protein sequencing had already transformed methods of <a href="/wiki/Scientific_classification" id="w">scientific classification</a> of organisms (especially <a href="/wiki/Cladistics" id="w">cladistics</a>) but biologists soon began to use RNA and DNA sequences as <a href="/wiki/Trait_(biology)" id="w">characters</a>; this expanded the significance of <a href="/wiki/Molecular_evolution" id="w">molecular evolution</a> within evolutionary biology, as the results of <a href="/wiki/Molecular_systematics" id="w">molecular systematics</a> could be compared with traditional evolutionary trees based on <a href="/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" id="w">morphology</a>. Following the pioneering ideas of <a href="/wiki/Lynn_Margulis" id="w">Lynn Margulis</a> on <a href="/wiki/Endosymbiotic_theory" id="w">endosymbiotic theory</a>, which holds that some of the <a href="/wiki/Organelles" id="w">organelles</a> of <a href="/wiki/Eukaryotic" id="w">eukaryotic</a> cells originated from free living <a href="/wiki/Prokaryotic" id="w">prokaryotic</a> organisms through <a href="/wiki/Symbiotic" id="w">symbiotic</a> relationships, even the overall division of the tree of life was revised. Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the <a href="/wiki/Archaea" id="w">Archaea</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" id="w">Bacteria</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Eukarya" id="w">Eukarya</a>) based on <a href="/wiki/Carl_Woese" id="w">Carl Woese&#39;s</a> pioneering <a href="/wiki/Molecular_systematics" id="w">molecular systematics</a> work with <a href="/wiki/16S_rRNA" id="w">16S rRNA</a> sequencing.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup></p>
<p>The development and popularization of the <a href="/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction" id="w">polymerase chain reaction</a> (PCR) in mid 1980s (by <a href="/wiki/Kary_Mullis" id="w">Kary Mullis</a> and others at <a href="/wiki/Cetus_Corp." id="w">Cetus Corp.</a>) marked another watershed in the history of modern biotechnology, greatly increasing the ease and speed of genetic analysis. Coupled with the use of <a href="/wiki/Expressed_sequence_tags" id="w">expressed sequence tags</a>, PCR led to the discovery of many more genes than could be found through traditional biochemical or genetic methods and opened the possibility of sequencing entire genomes.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The unity of much of the <a href="/wiki/Morphogenesis" id="w">morphogenesis</a> of organisms from fertilized egg to adult began to be unraveled after the discovery of the <a href="/wiki/Homeobox" id="w">homeobox</a> genes, first in fruit flies, then in other insects and animals, including humans. These developments led to advances in the field of <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology" id="w">evolutionary developmental biology</a> towards understanding how the various <a href="/wiki/Body_plan" id="w">body plans</a> of the animal phyla have evolved and how they are related to one another.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Human_Genome_Project" id="w">Human Genome Project</a>&#8212;the largest, most costly single biological study ever undertaken&#8212;began in 1988 under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/James_D._Watson" id="w">James D.
