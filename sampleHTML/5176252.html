<p><b><i>Diary of a Camper</i></b> is a short <a href="/wiki/1996_in_machinima" id="w">1996</a> <a href="/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States" id="w">American film</a> created by <a href="/wiki/United_Ranger_Films" id="w">United Ranger Films</a>, then a subdivision of a popular group of players, or <a href="/wiki/Clan_(gaming)" id="w">clan</a>, known as the Rangers. Made using <a href="/wiki/Id_Software" id="w">id Software</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/1996_in_video_gaming" id="w">1996</a> <a href="/wiki/First-person_shooter" id="w">first-person shooter</a> <a href="/wiki/Video_game" id="w">computer game</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Quake" id="w">Quake</a></i> and released over the <a href="/wiki/Internet" id="w">Internet</a> as a non-interactive <a href="/wiki/Game_demo" id="w">game demo</a> file, the video is considered<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> the first example of <a href="/wiki/Machinima" id="w">machinima</a>—the art of using real-time, virtual 3-D environments, often <a href="/wiki/Game_engine" id="w">game engines</a>, to create animated films. The story centers on a lone <a href="/wiki/Camping_(computer_gaming)" id="w">camper</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Pejorative" id="w">pejorative</a> for a player who waits in a strategic location instead of seeking active battle, who faces five members of the Rangers clan in a <a href="/wiki/Deathmatch_(gaming)" id="w">deathmatch</a>, a type of <a href="/wiki/Multiplayer_game" id="w">multiplayer game</a> whose goal is to kill as many opponents as possible.</p>
<p>Although players had previously recorded segments of gameplay, these were usually deathmatches or <a href="/wiki/Speedrun" id="w">speedruns</a>, attempts to complete a <a href="/wiki/Level_(computer_and_video_games)" id="w">map</a> as quickly as possible. <i>Diary of a Camper</i> was the first demo to contain a narrative with (text-based) dialogue, instead of merely showing gameplay. Commentators agree that the work itself is primitive, but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking.</p>
<a id="Synopsis" name="Synopsis"></a><h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>The film occurs entirely within the <i>Quake</i> map DM6 (&#34;The Dark Zone&#34;). After exploring some of the area, the Rangers gather and decide to send two members, Sphinx and Pyoveli, to scout a room above. Shortly after they teleport into the room, the camper waiting there kills them both, as confirmed by in-game text messages that appear on the screen. The remaining three Rangers—ColdSun, ArchV, and an unidentified member—realize their comrades&#39; fate and return fire from a distance, killing the camper. Examining the <a href="/wiki/Gibs" id="w">remains</a>, they identify their foe as <a href="/wiki/John_Romero" id="w">John Romero</a>.<sup id="_ref-Brown_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brown" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Precedent_and_new_ground" name="Precedent_and_new_ground"></a><h1>Precedent and new ground</h1>
<p><i>Diary of a Camper</i> built on the ability to record gameplay, which first appeared in id Software&#39;s <a href="/wiki/1993_in_video_gaming" id="w">1993 computer game</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Doom_(video_game)" id="w">Doom</a></i>. Using this feature, players could efficiently record game events, rather than the rendered video itself, and later replay them in real-time through the game engine.<sup id="_ref-Marino 3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marino 3" title="">[3]</a></sup> <i>Doom</i>{{&#39;}}s successor, <i>Quake</i>, offered new opportunities for both gameplay and customization,<sup id="_ref-Lowood 12_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lowood 12" title="">[4]</a></sup> while preserving the demo recording ability.<sup id="_ref-Marino 4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marino 4" title="">[5]</a></sup> In the book <i>Machinima</i>, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd stated that multiplayer games became popular, almost a sport, and demo files of matches were recorded and studied.<sup id="_ref-Kelland 28_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kelland 28" title="">[6]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Paul_Marino" id="w">Paul Marino</a>, executive director of the <a href="/wiki/Academy_of_Machinima_Arts_%26amp%3B_Sciences" id="w">Academy of Machinima Arts &#38; Sciences</a> (AMAS), used a different analogy: &#34;Players began to record deathmatches with a more cinematic flare.… <i>[T]he viewpoint of the player became the viewpoint of a director.</i>&#34;<sup id="_ref-Marino 4 emnph_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marino 4 emnph" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>When the Rangers released <i>Diary of a Camper</i> on <a href="/wiki/October_26" id="w">October 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a>,<sup id="_ref-Marino 21_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marino 21" title="">[8]</a></sup> they were already well-known for their playing skill and their ability to program <a href="/wiki/Mod_(computer_gaming)" id="w">game modifications</a>. The group&#39;s new demo surprised the <i>Quake</i> community by exploiting the game differently. It contained the action and gore of previous gameplay demos, but in the context of a simple story<sup id="_ref-Lowood 32_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lowood 32" title="">[9]</a></sup> instead of the usual deathmatch.<sup id="_ref-Kelland 28_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kelland 28" title="">[6]</a></sup> Like many of its predecessors, the demo was recorded in <i>Quake</i>{{&#39;}}s networked multiplayer deathmatch mode, but &#34;it marked the transition from sports footage to moviemaking. The players were choreographed like actors, … delivering their lines as plain text….&#34;<sup id="_ref-Kelland 28_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kelland 28" title="">[6]</a></sup> Henry Lowood of <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" id="w">Stanford University</a> stated that &#34;<i>Diary of a Camper</i> breaks with the demo movie as documented gameplay&#34; because the spectator&#39;s perspective is independent &#34;from that of any player/actor; the movie is not &#39;shot&#39; from the first-person perspective of the shooter.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Lowood 33_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lowood 33" title="">[10]</a></sup> Lowood called the film a &#34;transformation of competitive play to … minimal theatrical play&#34;, emphasized through the inclusion of references to gameplay, such as the camper.<sup id="_ref-Lowood 13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lowood 13" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Before <i>Diary of a Camper</i>{{&#39;}}s release, Uwe Girlich, a <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> doctoral candidate,<sup id="_ref-Kelland 37_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kelland 37" title="">[12]</a></sup> had documented the <i>Quake</i> demo file format, in which &#34;the player coordinates and camera positions may be different&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Lowood 33_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lowood 33" title="">[10]</a></sup> He added that &#34;for people with too much spare-time <i>Quake</i> can replace a full 3D modelling system&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Lowood 33_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lowood 33" title="">[10]</a></sup> However, the Rangers developed <i>Diary of a Camper</i> before any demo-editing software tools had been publicly released; clan member Eric &#34;ArchV&#34; Fowler instead created his own tools to reposition the camera and to splice recorded footage.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> As with all of United Ranger Films&#39; productions, Heath &#34;ColdSun&#34; Brown wrote the story, and Matt &#34;Unknown Soldier&#34; Van Sickler was the director.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> In the release notes, Brown credits clan members Chris &#34;Sphinx&#34; Birke<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> and Mute with helping Fowler with &#34;movie packaging&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Brown_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brown" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Diary of a Camper</i> and the films that it inspired were initially called &#34;<i>Quake</i> movies&#34;; the term <i>machinima</i> was not coined until 1998,<sup id="_ref-Marino 1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marino 1" title="">[16]</a></sup> in response to the increasing use of other game engines.<sup id="_ref-Marino 12_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marino 12" title="">[17]</a></sup> Therefore, there was initial hesitance to retroactively label <i>Diary of a Camper</i> the first machinima piece; a <a href="/wiki/Machinima.com" id="w">Machinima.com</a> article from January 2000 opened, &#34;It&#39;s kinda hard to pin down the first Machinima: things like the Doom speedruns, the <a href="/wiki/Stunt_Island" id="w">Stunt Island</a> stuff and the <a href="/wiki/Demoscene" id="w">Demo Scene</a> all compete for the title. However, it&#39;s a lot easier to pin down the first piece of film made in a 3D game engine: Diary Of A Camper&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Ranger Gone AWOL_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ranger Gone AWOL" title="">[18]</a></sup> However, after the AMAS later defined machinima as &#34;animated filmmaking within a real-time virtual 3-D environment&#34;,<sup id="_ref-Marino 1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marino 1" title="">[16]</a></sup> commentators, such as Marino<sup id="_ref-Marino 6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marino 6" title="">[19]</a></sup> and Lowood,<sup id="_ref-Lowood 32_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lowood 32" title="">[9]</a></sup> unambiguously called the film the first machinima work.</p>
<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h1>Reception</h1>
<p>Despite <i>Diary of a Camper</i>&#39;s importance in establishing machinima, commentators have criticized the film&#39;s actual content. Marino called the plot &#34;simple&#34;;<sup id="_ref-Marino 6_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marino 6" title="">[19]</a></sup> likewise, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd believed that &#34;it wasn&#39;t much of a story&#34;,<sup id="_ref-Kelland 28_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kelland 28" title="">[6]</a></sup> and Lowood wrote that &#34;the plot offers little more than a brief sequence of inside jokes&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Lowood 33_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lowood 33" title="">[10]</a></sup> Roger Matthews of the <i>Quake</i> Movie Library called the film &#34;not much more than a deathmatch with a camera&#34;.<sup id="_ref-QML_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-QML" title="">[20]</a></sup> On Psyk&#39;s Popcorn Jungle, Paul Coates bluntly wrote, &#34;This movie is <i>dull</i>. It is <i>not very interesting</i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Coates emph_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Coates emph" title="">[21]</a></sup> Stephen Lum of The Cineplex said that the film contained &#34;weird humour&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Cineplex_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cineplex" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although <i>Quake</i> movie critics found shortcomings in <i>Diary of a Camper</i>, they mentioned positive aspects, including the work&#39;s novelty; however, their final ratings varied. Matthews wrote that &#34;the camera work was very nice and never once screwed up&#34;,<sup id="_ref-QML_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-QML" title="">[20]</a></sup> and Lum gave the film &#34;a perfect 10 for Innovation/Originality because [it] started the Quake Movie craze&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Cineplex_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cineplex" title="">[22]</a></sup> Of the major <i>Quake</i> movie review sites,<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> only The Cineplex gave <i>Diary</i> a good rating overall, 7.5 out of 10.<sup id="_ref-Cineplex_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cineplex" title="">[22]</a></sup> Matthews and Coates rated the film 20% out of 100%<sup id="_ref-QML_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-QML" title="">[20]</a></sup> and 2 out of 10,<sup id="_ref-Coates_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Coates" title="">[24]</a></sup> respectively. Later, Coates updated his review, saying, &#34;I feel I overreacted at the fact that DoaC was old. It&#39;s the first <i>ever</i> Quake movie. I have to give the Rangers massive credit for that.… But, by today&#39;s standards, the rating seems to fit.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Coates emph_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Coates emph" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because of its significance, <i>Diary of a Camper</i> continues to be featured in machinima presentations. In a 2005 event at <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" id="w">Stanford University</a>, the film was presented with later machinima works, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Red_vs._Blue" id="w">Red vs. Blue</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Lue_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lue" title="">[25]</a></sup> Likewise, the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Centre_for_the_Moving_Image" id="w">Australian Centre for the Moving Image</a> included it in a machinima exhibit that ended on <a href="/wiki/July_16" id="w">July 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
