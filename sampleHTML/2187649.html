The strongest hurricane in the season was Hurricane Juliette, which reached peak winds of 150&#160;mph (240&#160;km/h).</p>
<p>The season officially started on <a href="/wiki/May_15" id="w">May 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a> in the eastern Pacific, and on <a href="/wiki/June_1" id="w">June 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a> in the central Pacific, and lasted until <a href="/wiki/November_30" id="w">November 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a>. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a>. The season saw eleven tropical cyclones form, of which ten became tropical storms. Seven storms attained hurricane status, of which three acquired <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Major hurricane" id="w">major hurricane status</a>.

The total ACE for the 1995 season was 100.2 x 10<sup>4</sup> kt<sup>2</sup>.

Because several storms in the season were long-lasting or intense, the ACE of the season was near normal. The 1995 season total was the lowest since <a href="/wiki/1981_Pacific_hurricane_season" id="w">1981</a>, though due to a period of inactivity in the following years it has only been surpassed by four seasons.<sup id="_ref-ACE_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ACE" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
