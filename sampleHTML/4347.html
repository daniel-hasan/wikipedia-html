<p><b>The British Broadcasting Corporation</b>, which is usually known simply as the <b>BBC</b>, is the largest <a href="/wiki/Broadcasting" id="w">broadcasting</a> corporation in the world<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> in terms of audience numbers and revenue.

The original <i><a href="/wiki/British_Broadcasting_Company" id="w">British Broadcasting Company</a></i> was founded in 1922 by a group of <a href="/wiki/Telecommunications" id="w">telecommunications</a> companies &#8212; <a href="/wiki/Marconi%26%2339%3Bs_Wireless_Telegraph_Company" id="w">Marconi</a>, Radio Communication Company, <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan-Vickers" id="w">Metropolitan-Vickers</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_General_Electric_Company_plc" id="w">General Electric</a>, <a href="/wiki/Western_Electric" id="w">Western Electric</a>,  and <a href="/wiki/British_Thomson-Houston" id="w">British Thomson-Houston</a><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> &#8212; to broadcast experimental radio services. The first transmission was on <a href="/wiki/14_November" id="w">14 November</a> of that year, from station 2LO, located at Marconi House, London.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Company, with John Reith as general manager, became the <i>British Broadcasting Corporation</i> in 1927 when it was granted a <a href="/wiki/Royal_Charter" id="w">Royal Charter</a> of incorporation and ceased to be privately owned. It started experimental television broadcasting in 1932 using an entirely mechanical 30 line system developed by <a href="/wiki/John_Logie_Baird" id="w">John Logie Baird</a>. It became a regular service (known as the <a href="/wiki/BBC_Television_Service" id="w">BBC Television Service</a>) in 1936 alternating between a Baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic <a href="/wiki/405_line" id="w">405 line</a> EMI system.  The superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped later that year.  Television broadcasting was suspended from <a href="/wiki/1_September" id="w">1 September</a>, <a href="/wiki/1939" id="w">1939</a> to <a href="/wiki/7_June" id="w">7 June</a>, <a href="/wiki/1946" id="w">1946</a> during the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">Second World War</a>. A widely reported <a href="/wiki/Urban_myth" id="w">urban myth</a> is that, upon resumption of service, announcer <a href="/wiki/Leslie_Mitchell_(broadcaster)" id="w">Leslie Mitchell</a> started by saying, &#34;As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted...&#34; In fact, the first person to appear when transmission resumed was <a href="/wiki/Jasmine_Bligh" id="w">Jasmine Bligh</a> and the words said were &#34;Good afternoon, everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh...?&#34;<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union" id="w">European Broadcasting Union</a> was formed on <a href="/wiki/12_February" id="w">12 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1950" id="w">1950</a>, in Torquay with the BBC among the 23 founding broadcasting organisations.</p>
<p>Competition to the BBC was introduced in 1955 with the commercially and independently operated television network <a href="/wiki/ITV" id="w">ITV</a>, however, the BBC monopoly on radio services would persist into the 1970s. As a result of the <a href="/wiki/Pilkington_Committee_on_Broadcasting" id="w">Pilkington Committee</a> report of 1962, in which the BBC was lauded and ITV was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> the BBC was awarded a second TV channel, <a href="/wiki/BBC_Two" id="w">BBC2</a>, in 1964, renaming the existing channel <a href="/wiki/BBC1" id="w">BBC1</a>. BBC2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across Europe.  BBC2 was broadcast in colour from <a href="/wiki/1_July" id="w">1 July</a>, <a href="/wiki/1967" id="w">1967</a>, and was joined by BBC 1 and ITV on <a href="/wiki/15_November" id="w">15 November</a>, <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a>.  The 405 line <a href="/wiki/Vhf#United Kingdom" id="w">VHF</a> transmissions of BBC 1 (and ITV) were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985.</p>
<p>Starting in 1964 a series of <a href="/wiki/Pirate_radio" id="w">pirate radio</a> stations (starting with <a href="/wiki/Radio_Caroline" id="w">Radio Caroline</a>) came on the air, and forced the UK government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally-based advertising financed services.  In response the BBC reorganized and renamed their radio channels.    The Light Programme was split into Radio-1 offering continuous rock music and Radio-2 more &#34;Easy Listening&#34;<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>.     The &#34;Third&#34; programme became Radio-3 offering classical music and cultural programming.   The Home Service became Radio-4 offering news, and non-musical content such as quiz shows, readings, dramas and plays.   As well as the four national channels, a series of local BBC radio stations was established <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In 1974, the BBC&#39;s teletext service, <a href="/wiki/Ceefax" id="w">Ceefax</a>, was introduced but was not finally transmitted in vision as such until April 1980.{{Fact}} In 1978, the BBC went on strike just before the Christmas of that year, thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Since the <a href="/wiki/Deregulation" id="w">deregulation</a> of the UK television and radio market in the 1980s, the BBC has faced increased competition from the commercial sector (and from the advertiser-funded public service broadcaster <a href="/wiki/Channel_4" id="w">Channel 4</a>), especially on <a href="/wiki/Satellite_television" id="w">satellite television</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cable_television" id="w">cable television</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Digital_television" id="w">digital television</a> services.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/BBC_Research_Department" id="w">BBC Research Department</a> has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques. In the early days it carried out essential research into acoustics and programme level and noise measurement.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>The 2004 <a href="/wiki/Hutton_Inquiry" id="w">Hutton Inquiry</a> and the subsequent Report raised questions about the BBC&#39;s journalistic standards and its impartiality. This led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then Director General, Greg Dyke. In January 2007, the BBC released minutes of the Board meeting which led to Greg Dyke&#39;s resignation. Many commentators have considered the discussions documented in the minutes to have made Dyke&#39;s ability to remain in position untenable and tantamount to a dismissal.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Unlike the other departments of the BBC, BBC World Service is funded by the <a href="/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office" id="w">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a>. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, more commonly known as the Foreign Office or the FCO, is the British government department responsible for promoting the interests of the United Kingdom abroad.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/18_October" id="w">18 October</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, BBC Director General Mark Thompson announced a controversial plan to make major cuts and reduce the size of the BBC as an organisation.  The plans include a reduction in  posts of 2,500; including 1,800 redundancies, consolidating news operations, reducing programming output by 10% and selling off the flagship Television Centre building in London.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>  These plans have been fiercely opposed by unions, who have threatened a series of strikes, however the BBC have stated that the cuts are essential to move the organisation forward and concentrate on increasing the quality of programming.</p>

<p>The principal means of funding the BBC is through the television licence, costing £11.37 a month if paid by <a href="/wiki/Direct_debit" id="w">direct debit</a> (as of February 2007). Such a licence is required to operate a broadcast <a href="/wiki/Television" id="w">television</a> receiver within the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">UK</a>. The cost of a television licence is set by the government and enforced by the criminal law. The revenue is collected privately and is paid into the central government <a href="/wiki/Consolidated_Fund" id="w">Consolidated Fund</a>, a process defined in the <a href="/wiki/Communications_Act_2003" id="w">Communications Act 2003</a>. Funds are then allocated by the DCMS and Treasury and approved by Parliament via the Appropriation Act(s). Additional revenues are paid by the Department for Work and Pensions to compensate for subsidised licences for over-75s. As the state controls BBC&#39;s funding, it is sometimes referred to as a &#34;state&#34; broadcaster,considred as a calumny by many because of the checks and balances which ensure its editorial independence.</p>
<p>Income from commercial enterprises and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes has substantially increased over recent years,<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> with <a href="/wiki/BBC_Worldwide" id="w">BBC Worldwide</a> contributing some £145 million to the BBC&#39;s core public service business.</p>
<p>According to the BBC&#39;s 2005-2006 Annual Report,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> its income can be broken down as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>£3,100.6 m licence fees collected from consumers.</li>
<li>£620.0 m from BBC Commercial Businesses.</li>
<li>£260.2 m from the World Service, of which £239.1 m is from grants (primarily funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office), £15.8 m from subscriptions, and £5.3 m from other sources.</li>

It is home to three of the ten BBC national radio networks. They are <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radio_3" id="w">BBC Radio 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radio_4" id="w">BBC Radio 4</a>, and <a href="/wiki/BBC_7" id="w">BBC 7</a>. On the front of the building are statues of <a href="/wiki/Prospero" id="w">Prospero</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ariel_(Shakespeare)" id="w">Ariel</a> (from <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" id="w">Shakespeare&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tempest_(play)" id="w">The Tempest</a></i>) sculpted by <a href="/wiki/Eric_Gill" id="w">Eric Gill</a>.</p>
<p>Renovation of Broadcasting House began in 2002 and is scheduled for completion in 2010. As part of a major reorganisation of BBC property, Broadcasting House is to become home to <a href="/wiki/BBC_News" id="w">BBC News</a> (both television and radio), national radio, and the <a href="/wiki/BBC_World_Service" id="w">BBC World Service</a>. The major part of this plan involves the demolition of the two post-war extensions to the building and construction of a new building<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> beside the existing structure. During the rebuilding process many of the BBC Radio networks have been relocated to other buildings in the vicinity of Portland Place.</p>
<p>In 2010, the entire BBC News operation is expected to relocate from the News Centre at <a href="/wiki/BBC_Television_Centre" id="w">BBC Television Centre</a> to the refurbished Broadcasting House in what is being described as &#34;one of the world&#39;s largest live broadcast centres&#34;.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>By far the largest concentration of BBC staff in the UK exists in <a href="/wiki/White_City%2C_London" id="w">White City</a>. Well known buildings in this area include the <a href="/wiki/BBC_Television_Centre" id="w">BBC Television Centre</a>, White City, Media Centre, Broadcast Centre and Centre House.</p>
<p>As well as the various BBC buildings in London, there are major BBC production centres located in <a href="/wiki/Cardiff" id="w">Cardiff</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belfast" id="w">Belfast</a>, <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" id="w">Glasgow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" id="w">Birmingham</a>, <a href="/wiki/Manchester" id="w">Manchester</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bristol" id="w">Bristol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Southampton" id="w">Southampton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne" id="w">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>. Some of these local centres (for example Belfast) are also known as &#34;Broadcasting House&#34; (see <a href="/wiki/Broadcasting_House_(disambiguation)" id="w">Broadcasting House (disambiguation)</a>). There are also many smaller local and regional studios scattered throughout the UK.</p>
<p>In 2011, the BBC is planning to move several departments including <a href="/wiki/BBC_Sport" id="w">BBC Sport</a> and <a href="/wiki/BBC_Children%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">BBC Children&#39;s</a> north to newly built premises in <a href="/wiki/Salford_Quays" id="w">Salford Quays</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greater_Manchester" id="w">Greater Manchester</a>.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> This will mark a major decentralisation of the corporation&#39;s operations from London.</p>

<a href="/wiki/BBC_One" id="w">BBC One</a> and <a href="/wiki/BBC_Two" id="w">BBC Two</a> are the BBC&#39;s flagship television channels. The BBC is also promoting the new channels <a href="/wiki/BBC_Three" id="w">BBC Three</a> and <a href="/wiki/BBC_Four" id="w">BBC Four</a>, which are only available via <a href="/wiki/Digital_television" id="w">digital television</a> equipment (now in widespread use in the UK, with analogue transmission being phased out by December 2012<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup>). The BBC also runs <a href="/wiki/BBC_News_24" id="w">BBC News 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/BBC_Parliament" id="w">BBC Parliament</a>, and two children&#39;s channels, <a href="/wiki/CBBC_Channel" id="w">CBBC</a> and <a href="/wiki/CBeebies" id="w">CBeebies</a>, on digital. </p>
<p>BBC One is a regionalised TV service which provides opt-outs throughout the day for local news and other local programming. These variations are more pronounced in the BBC &#39;Nations&#39;, i.e. <a href="/wiki/BBC_Northern_Ireland" id="w">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="/wiki/BBC_Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> and <a href="/wiki/BBC_Wales" id="w">Wales</a>, where the presentation is mostly carried out locally on BBC One and Two. BBC Two variations within England are currently rare, though most regions still have the ability to &#39;opt out&#39; of the main feed, albeit on analogue only. BBC Two was also the first channel to be transmitted on 625 lines in 1964, then carry a small-scale regular colour service from 1967. BBC One would follow in December 1969.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" id="w">Republic of Ireland</a>, the BBC channels are available in a number of ways. All multichannel platforms carry them, although many viewers also receive BBC services via &#39;overspill&#39; from transmitters in Northern Ireland or Wales, or via &#39;deflectors&#39; - transmitters in the Republic which rebroadcast broadcasts from the UK, received off-air, or from Digital Satellite.</p>
<p>From <a href="/wiki/June_9" id="w">June 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, the BBC began a 6-12 month trial of <a href="/wiki/High-definition_television" id="w">High-definition television</a> broadcasts under the name <a href="/wiki/BBC_HD" id="w">BBC HD</a>.

<p>Since 1975, the BBC has also provided its TV programmes to the <a href="/wiki/British_Forces_Broadcasting_Service" id="w">British Forces Broadcasting Service</a> (BFBS), allowing members of <a href="/wiki/Military_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">HM Forces</a> serving all over the world to watch and listen to their favourite programmes from home on two dedicated TV channels.</p>

<p>Another version of the BBC website is available called BBC Beta. if you go to www.bbc.co.uk/home/beta, then you can customise and create your own BBC homepage to your own specific needs. This service was created in December 2007.</p>
<p>The website allows the BBC to produce sections which complement the various programmes on television and radio, and it is common for viewers and listeners to be told <a href="/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator" id="w">website addresses</a> for the bbc.co.uk sections relating to that programme. The site also allows users to listen to most Radio output live and for seven days after broadcast using its <a href="/wiki/RealPlayer" id="w">RealPlayer</a>-based &#34;Radio Player&#34;; some TV content is also distributed in <a href="/wiki/RealVideo" id="w">RealVideo</a> format. A new system known as <a href="/wiki/BBC_iPlayer" id="w">iPlayer</a> was launched on <a href="/wiki/July_27" id="w">July 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, which uses <a href="/wiki/Peer-to-peer" id="w">peer-to-peer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Digital_rights_management" id="w">DRM</a> technology to deliver both radio and TV content of the last seven days for offline use for up to 30 days. Also, through participation in the <a href="/wiki/Creative_Archive_Licence" id="w">Creative Archive Licence</a> group, bbc.co.uk allowed legal downloads of selected archive material via the internet.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/BBC_jam" id="w">BBC jam</a> is a free online service, delivered through broadband and narrowband connections, providing high-quality interactive resources designed to stimulate learning at home and at school.

<p>In recent years some major on-line companies and politicians have complained that the bbc.co.uk website receives too much funding from the television licence, meaning that other websites are unable to compete with the vast amount of advertising-free on-line content available on bbc.co.uk.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> Some have proposed that the amount of licence fee money spent on bbc.co.uk should be reduced &#8212; either being replaced with funding from advertisements or subscriptions, or a reduction in the amount of content available on the site.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> In response to this the BBC carried out an investigation, and has now set in motion a plan to change the way it provides its online services. bbc.co.uk will now attempt to fill in gaps in the market, and will guide users to other websites for currently existing market provision. (For example, instead of providing local events information and timetables, users will be guided to outside websites already providing that information.)
Part of this plan included the BBC closing some of its websites, and rediverting money to redevelop other parts.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> More recent information on web plans at <a class="externallink" href="http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1219009.ece" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1219009.ece">http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1219009.ece</a></p>

<a id="Unions" name="Unions"></a><h1>Unions</h1>
<p>Union membership is a private matter between staff and their chosen union: staff are not automatically covered by a union, but since the BBC is a large employer (in the media sector), membership numbers are considerable.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Staff at the BBC are normally represented by <a href="/wiki/BECTU" id="w">BECTU</a>, along with journalistic staff by the <a href="/wiki/National_Union_of_Journalists" id="w">NUJ</a> and electrical staff by <a href="/wiki/Amicus" id="w">Amicus</a>. Union membership is optional, and paid for by staff members and not by the BBC.</p>
<a id="Cultural_significance" name="Cultural_significance"></a><h1>Cultural significance</h1>
<p>The BBC was the only television broadcaster in the United Kingdom until 1955 and the only legal radio broadcaster until 1973.  Its cultural impact was therefore significant since the country had no choice for its information and entertainment from these two powerful media.  </p>
<p>Even after the advent of commercial television and radio, the BBC has remained one of the main elements in British popular culture through its obligation to produce TV and radio programmes for the mass audiences.  However the arrival of BBC2 allowed the BBC also to make programmes for minority interests in drama, documentaries, current affairs, entertainment and sport. Examples are cited such as <i><a href="/wiki/I%2C_Claudius_(TV_series)" id="w">I, Claudius</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Civilisation_(TV_programme)" id="w">Civilisation</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Tonight_(1957_TV_series)" id="w">Tonight</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Monty_Python%26%2339%3Bs_Flying_Circus" id="w">Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Pot_Black" id="w">Pot Black</a></i>, but many other ground-breaking examples can be given in each of these fields as shown by the BBC&#39;s entries in the <a href="/wiki/British_Film_Institute" id="w">British Film Institute</a>&#39;s 2000 list of the <a href="/wiki/100_Greatest_British_Television_Programmes" id="w">100 Greatest British Television Programmes</a>.<sup id="_ref-tv100_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tv100" title="">[56]</a></sup> In radio the BBC has also maintained a high standard of news, drama, entertainment, documentaries, sport and music for all tastes, and still draws large audiences, while also serving minority tastes. </p>
<p>The BBC&#39;s objective of providing a service to the public, rather than just entertainment, has changed the public&#39;s perception in a wide range of subjects from health to natural history. By maintaining a high standard the BBC also defined a quality threshold that the commercial companies had to reach to retain their licences, but the advent of the multi-channel age is lessening this effect.  The export of BBC programmes, the <a href="/wiki/BBC_World_Service" id="w">BBC World Service</a> and <a href="/wiki/BBC_World" id="w">BBC World</a> have meant that the cultural impact of the BBC has been also experienced world-wide. </p>
<p>Although the BBC has changed society, the society has also changed the BBC. The term <a href="/wiki/BBC_English" id="w">BBC English</a> (Received Pronunciation) refers to the former use of <a href="/wiki/Standard_English" id="w">Standard English</a> with this accent.  However the organisation now makes more use of <a href="/wiki/Regional_accents_of_English_speakers" id="w">regional accents</a> in order to reflect the diversity of the UK, though clarity and fluency are still expected of presenters. From its &#39;starchy&#39; beginnings, the BBC has also become more inclusive, and now accommodates the interests of all strata of society and all minorities, because they all pay the licence fee. The BBC therefore plays a major role in maintaining a cohesive society.</p>
<p>Competition from <a href="/wiki/ITV" id="w">Independent Television</a>, <a href="/wiki/Channel_4" id="w">Channel 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/British_Sky_Broadcasting" id="w">Sky</a> and other broadcast television stations, has slightly lessened the BBC&#39;s reach, but nevertheless it remains a major influence on British popular culture. Many popular everyday sayings are derived from BBC-produced television shows.{{Fact}}</p>

The BBC has long faced allegations of a left-wing or liberal bias,<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> and such criticism has been repeated most recently by past and present employees such as <a href="/wiki/Antony_Jay" id="w">Antony Jay</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Randall_(journalist)" id="w">Jeff Randall</a>, <a href="/wiki/Justin_Webb" id="w">Justin Webb</a> and <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Marr" id="w">Andrew Marr</a>.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup>  Left-wing figures, such as the journalist <a href="/wiki/John_Pilger" id="w">John Pilger</a>, have frequently accused the BBC of a right-wing bias (a view supported by UK media watchdog Media Lens); the anti-Iraq war <a href="/wiki/MP" id="w">MP</a> <a href="/wiki/George_Galloway" id="w">George Galloway</a> has referred to it as the &#34;Bush and Blair Corporation&#34;. <sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>The BBC received its most serious criticism of recent times over its coverage of the events leading up to the war in Iraq.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> The controversy over what it described as the &#34;sexing up&#34; of the case for war in Iraq by the government, led to the BBC being heavily criticised by the <a href="/wiki/Hutton_Inquiry" id="w">Hutton Inquiry</a>,<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> although this finding was much disputed by the British press.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
