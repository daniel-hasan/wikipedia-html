<p><b>Enzyme inhibitors</b> are <a href="/wiki/Molecule" id="w">molecules</a> that bind to <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" id="w">enzymes</a> and decrease their <a href="/wiki/Enzyme_activity" id="w">activity</a>. Since blocking an enzyme&#39;s activity can kill a <a href="/wiki/Pathogen" id="w">pathogen</a> or correct a <a href="/wiki/Metabolism" id="w">metabolic</a> imbalance, many drugs are enzyme inhibitors. They are also used as <a href="/wiki/Herbicide" id="w">herbicides</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" id="w">pesticides</a>. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; <i><a href="/wiki/Enzyme_activator" id="w">enzyme activators</a></i> bind to enzymes and increase their <a href="/wiki/Enzyme_assay" id="w">enzymatic activity</a>.</p>
<p>The binding of an inhibitor can stop a <a href="/wiki/Substrate_(biochemistry)" id="w">substrate</a> from entering the enzyme&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Active_site" id="w">active site</a> and/or hinder the enzyme from <a href="/wiki/Catalysis" id="w">catalysing</a> its reaction.  Inhibitor binding is either <a href="/wiki/Reversible_reaction" id="w">reversible</a> or irreversible. Irreversible inhibitors usually react with the enzyme and change it chemically. These inhibitors modify key <a href="/wiki/Amino_acid" id="w">amino acid</a> residues needed for enzymatic activity. In contrast, reversible inhibitors bind <a href="/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)" id="w">non-covalently</a> and different types of inhibition are produced depending on whether these inhibitors bind the <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" id="w">enzyme</a>, the enzyme-substrate complex, or both.</p>
<p>Many <a href="/wiki/Medication" id="w">drug molecules</a> are enzyme inhibitors, so their discovery and improvement is an active area of research in <a href="/wiki/Biochemistry" id="w">biochemistry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pharmacology" id="w">pharmacology</a>. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its <a href="/wiki/Specificity_(tests)" id="w">specificity</a> (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its <a href="/wiki/Dissociation_constant" id="w">dissociation constant</a>, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few <a href="/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction" id="w">side effects</a> and thus low <a href="/wiki/Toxicity" id="w">toxicity</a>.</p>
<p>Enzyme inhibitors also occur naturally and are involved in the regulation of metabolism. For example, enzymes in a <a href="/wiki/Metabolic_pathway" id="w">metabolic pathway</a> can be inhibited by downstream products. This type of <a href="/wiki/Negative_feedback" id="w">negative feedback</a> slows flux through a pathway when the products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain <a href="/wiki/Homeostasis" id="w">homeostasis</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Cell_(biology)" id="w">cell</a>. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are <a href="/wiki/Protein" id="w">proteins</a> that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This can help control enzymes that may be damaging to a cell, such as <a href="/wiki/Protease" id="w">proteases</a> or <a href="/wiki/Nuclease" id="w">nucleases</a>; a well-characterised example is the <a href="/wiki/Ribonuclease_inhibitor" id="w">ribonuclease inhibitor</a>, which binds to <a href="/wiki/Ribonuclease" id="w">ribonucleases</a> in one of the tightest known <a href="/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction" id="w">protein–protein interactions</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Natural enzyme inhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defenses against predators or as ways of killing prey.</p>
<a id="Reversible_inhibitors" name="Reversible_inhibitors"></a><h2>Reversible inhibitors</h2>
<a id="Types_of_reversible_inhibitor" name="Types_of_reversible_inhibitor"></a><h3>Types of reversible inhibitor</h3>
<p>Reversible inhibitors bind to enzymes with non-covalent interactions such as <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_bond" id="w">hydrogen bonds</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydrophobic_interaction" id="w">hydrophobic interactions</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ionic_bond" id="w">ionic bonds</a>. Multiple weak bonds between the inhibitor and the active site combine to produce strong and specific binding. In contrast to <a href="/wiki/Substrate_(biochemistry)" id="w">substrates</a> and irreversible inhibitors, reversible inhibitors generally do not undergo chemical reactions when bound to the enzyme and can be easily removed by dilution or dialysis.</p>

</p>
<p>There are three kinds of reversible enzyme inhibitors. They are classified according to the effect of varying the concentration of the enzyme&#39;s substrate on the inhibitor.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li>In <b><a href="/wiki/Competitive_inhibition" id="w">competitive inhibition</a></b>, the substrate and inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme at the same time, as shown in the figure on the left. This usually results from the inhibitor having an affinity for the <a href="/wiki/Active_site" id="w">active site</a> of an enzyme where the substrate also binds; the substrate and inhibitor <i>compete</i> for access to the enzyme&#39;s active site. This type of inhibition can be overcome by sufficiently high concentrations of substrate, i.e., by out-competing the inhibitor. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate (see examples below).</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>In <b><a href="/wiki/Mixed_inhibition" id="w">mixed inhibition</a></b>, the inhibitor can bind to the enzyme at the same time as the enzyme&#39;s substrate. However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate, and vice versa. This type of inhibition can be reduced, but not overcome by increasing concentrations of substrate. Although it is possible for mixed-type inhibitors to bind in the active site, this type of inhibition generally results from an <a href="/wiki/Allosteric" id="w">allosteric</a> effect where the inhibitor binds to a different site on an enzyme. Inhibitor binding to this <a href="/wiki/Allosteric_site" id="w">allosteric site</a> changes the <a href="/wiki/Conformational_isomerism" id="w">conformation</a> (i.e., <a href="/wiki/Tertiary_structure" id="w">tertiary structure</a> or three-dimensional shape) of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the active site is reduced.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Non-competitive_inhibition" id="w">Non-competitive inhibition</a></b> is a form of mixed inhibition where the binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme reduces its <a href="/wiki/Enzyme_activity" id="w">activity</a> but does not affect the binding of substrate. As a result, the extent of inhibition depends only on the concentration of the inhibitor.</li></ul>
<a id="Quantitative_description_of_reversible_inhibition" name="Quantitative_description_of_reversible_inhibition"></a><h3>Quantitative description of reversible inhibition</h3>
<p>Reversible inhibition can be described quantitatively in terms of the inhibitor&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Dissociation_constant" id="w">binding</a> to the enzyme and to the enzyme–substrate complex, and its effects on the <a href="/wiki/Enzyme_kinetics" id="w">kinetic constants</a> of the enzyme. In the classic <a href="/wiki/Michaelis-Menten_kinetics" id="w">Michaelis–Menten scheme</a> below, an enzyme (E) binds to its substrate (S) to form the enzyme–substrate complex ES. Upon catalysis, this complex breaks down to release product P and free enzyme. The inhibitor (I) can bind to either E or ES with the <a href="/wiki/Dissociation_constant" id="w">dissociation constants</a> <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> or <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>&#39;, respectively.
</p>
<div style="page-break-inside:	avoid;">
<table>
<tr>
<td>

<ul>
<li>Competitive inhibitors can bind to E, but not to ES. Competitive inhibition increases <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> (i.e., the inhibitor interferes with substrate binding), but does not affect <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> (the inhibitor does not hamper catalysis in ES because it cannot bind to ES).</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Non-competitive inhibitors have identical affinities for E and ES (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>&#39;). Non-competitive inhibition does not change <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> (i.e., it does not affect substrate binding) but decreases <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> (i.e., inhibitor binding hampers catalysis).</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Mixed-type inhibitors bind to both E and ES, but their affinities for these two forms of the enzyme are different (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> ≠ <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>&#39;). Thus, mixed-type inhibitors interfere with substrate binding (increase <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>) and hamper catalysis in the ES complex (decrease <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>).</li></ul></td>

<p>When an enzyme has multiple substrates, inhibitors can show different types of inhibition depending on which substrate is considered. This results from the active site containing two different binding sites within the active site, one for each substrate. For example, an inhibitor might compete with substrate A for the first binding site, but be a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to substrate B in the second binding site.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Lineweaver–Burk diagrams of different types of reversible enzyme inhibitors. The arrow shows the effect of increasing concentrations of inhibitor.</div></div>
</p>
<p>As noted above, an enzyme inhibitor is characterized by its two <a href="/wiki/Dissociation_constant" id="w">dissociation constants</a>, <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>&#39;, to the enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex, respectively. The enzyme-inhibitor constant <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> can be measured directly by various methods; one extremely accurate method is <a href="/wiki/Isothermal_Titration_Calorimetry" id="w">isothermal titration calorimetry</a>, in which the inhibitor is titrated into a solution of enzyme and the heat released or absorbed is measured.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> However, the other dissociation constant <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>&#39; is difficult to measure directly, since the enzyme-substrate complex is short-lived and undergoing a chemical reaction to form the product. Hence, <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>&#39; is usually measured indirectly, by observing the <a href="/wiki/Enzyme_activity" id="w">enzyme activity</a> under various substrate and inhibitor concentrations, and <a href="/wiki/Nonlinear_regression" id="w">fitting</a> the data<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> to a modified <a href="/wiki/Enzyme_kinetics" id="w">Michaelis–Menten equation</a></p>

<dl><dd><span class="math"> 
V = \frac{V_{max}[S]}{\alpha K_{m} + \alpha^{\prime}[S]} = \frac{(1/\alpha^{\prime})V_{max}[S]}{(\alpha/\alpha^{\prime}) K_{m} + [S]}
</span></dd></dl>

<p>where the modifying factors α and α&#39; are defined by the inhibitor concentration and its two dissociation constants</p>

<dl><dd><span class="math">
\alpha = 1 + \frac{[I]}{K_{i}}
</span></dd></dl><dl><dd><span class="math">
\alpha^{\prime} = 1 + \frac{[I]}{K_{i}^{\prime}}
</span></dd></dl>

<p>Thus, in the presence of the inhibitor, the enzyme&#39;s effective <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> become (α/α&#39;)<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and (1/α&#39;)<i>V</i><sub>max</sub>, respectively. However, the modified Michaelis-Menten equation assumes that binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme has reached equilibrium, which may be a very slow process for inhibitors with sub-nanomolar dissociation constants. In these cases, it is usually more practical to treat the tight-binding inhibitor as an irreversible inhibitor (see below); however, it can still be possible to estimate <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>&#39; kinetically if <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> is measured independently.</p>
<p>The effects of different types of reversible enzyme inhibitors on enzymatic activity can be visualized using graphical representations of the Michaelis–Menten equation, such as <a href="/wiki/Lineweaver-Burk_plot" id="w">Lineweaver–Burk</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eadie-Hofstee_diagram" id="w">Eadie-Hofstee plots</a>. For example, in the Lineweaver-Burk plots at the right, the competitive inhibition lines intersect on the <i>y</i>-axis, illustrating that such inhibitors do not affect <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>.  Similarly, the non-competitive inhibition lines intersect on the <i>x</i>-axis, showing these inhibitors do not affect <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>. However, it can be difficult to estimate <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>&#39; accurately from such plots,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> so it is advisable to estimate these constants using more reliable <a href="/wiki/Nonlinear_regression" id="w">nonlinear regression</a> methods, as described above.</p>
<a id="Special_cases" name="Special_cases"></a><h3>Special cases</h3>

<ul>
<li>The mechanism of <b>partially competitive inhibition</b> is similar to that of non-competitive, except that the EIS complex has catalytic activity, which may be lower or even higher (partially competitive activation) than that of the enzyme–substrate (ES) complex. This inhibition typically displays a lower <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>, but an unaffected <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value.<sup id="_ref-Segel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Segel" title="">[7]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Uncompetitive_inhibition" id="w">Uncompetitive inhibition</a></b> occurs when the inhibitor binds only to the enzyme–substrate complex, not to the free enzyme; the EIS complex is catalytically inactive. This mode of inhibition is rare and causes a decrease in both <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> and the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value.<sup id="_ref-Segel_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Segel" title="">[7]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Substrate and product inhibition</b> is where either the substrate or product of an enzyme reaction inhibit the enzyme&#39;s activity. This inhibition may follow the competitive, uncompetitive or mixed patterns. In substrate inhibition there is a progressive decrease in activity at high substrate concentrations. This may indicate the existence of two substrate-binding sites in the enzyme. At low substrate, the high-affinity site is occupied and normal <a href="/wiki/Enzyme_kinetics" id="w">kinetics</a> are followed. However, at higher concentrations, the second inhibitory site becomes occupied, inhibiting the enzyme.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Product inhibition is often a regulatory feature in <a href="/wiki/Metabolism" id="w">metabolism</a> and can be a form of <a href="/wiki/Negative_feedback" id="w">negative feedback</a>.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Slow-tight inhibition</b> occurs when the initial enzyme–inhibitor complex EI undergoes isomerisation to a second more tightly held complex, EI*, but the overall inhibition process is reversible. This manifests itself as slowly increasing enzyme inhibition. Under these conditions, traditional Michaelis–Menten kinetics give a false value for <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>, which is time–dependent. The true value of <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> can be obtained through more complex analysis of the on (<i>k</i><sub>on</sub>) and off (<i>k</i><sub>off</sub>) rate constants for inhibitor association. See <a href="/wiki/#Irreversible inhibitors" id="w">irreversible inhibition</a> below for more information.</li></ul>

</p>
<p>As enzymes have evolved to bind their substrates tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind in the active site of enzymes, it is unsurprising that some of these inhibitors are strikingly similar in structure to the substrates of their targets. An example of these substrate mimics are the <a href="/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)" id="w">protease inhibitors</a>, a very successful class of <a href="/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug" id="w">antiretroviral drugs</a> used to treat <a href="/wiki/HIV" id="w">HIV</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> The structure of <a href="/wiki/Ritonavir" id="w">ritonavir</a>, a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three <a href="/wiki/Peptide_bond" id="w">peptide bonds</a>, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme&#39;s active site.</p>
<p>Enzyme inhibitors are often designed to mimic the <a href="/wiki/Transition_state" id="w">transition state</a> or intermediate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction. This ensures that the inhibitor exploits the transition state stabilising effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>) than substrate-based designs. An example of such a transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug <a href="/wiki/Oseltamivir" id="w">oseltamivir</a>; this drug mimics the planar nature of the ring <a href="/wiki/Oxonium_ion" id="w">oxonium ion</a> in the reaction of the viral enzyme <a href="/wiki/Neuraminidase" id="w">neuraminidase</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Nonpeptidic protease inhibitor <a href="/wiki/Tipranavir" id="w">tipranavir</a></div></div>
</p>
<p>However, not all inhibitors are based on the structures of substrates. For example, the structure of another HIV protease inhibitor <a href="/wiki/Tipranavir" id="w">tipranavir</a> is shown on the left. This molecule is not based on a peptide and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate. These non-peptide inhibitors can be more stable than inhibitors containing peptide bonds, because they will not be substrates for <a href="/wiki/Peptidase" id="w">peptidases</a> and are less likely to be degraded.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>In drug design it is important to consider the concentrations of substrates to which the target enzymes are exposed. For example, some <a href="/wiki/Protein_kinase" id="w">protein kinase</a> inhibitors have chemical structures that are similar to <a href="/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate" id="w">adenosine triphosphate</a>, one of the substrates of these enzymes. However, drugs that are simple competitive inhibitors will have to compete with the high concentrations of ATP in the cell. Protein kinases can also be inhibited by competition at the binding sites where the kinases interact with their substrate proteins, and most proteins are present inside cells at concentrations much lower than the concentration of ATP. As a consequence, if two protein kinase inhibitors both bind in the active site with similar affinity, but only one has to compete with ATP, then the competitive inhibitor at the protein-binding site will inhibit the enzyme more effectively.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>Irreversible inhibitors usually <a href="/wiki/Covalent" id="w">covalently</a> modify an enzyme, and inhibition cannot therefore be reversed. Irreversible inhibitors often contain reactive functional groups such as <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_mustard" id="w">nitrogen mustards</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aldehyde" id="w">aldehydes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Haloalkane" id="w">haloalkanes</a> or <a href="/wiki/Alkene" id="w">alkenes</a>. These <a href="/wiki/Electrophile" id="w">electrophilic</a> groups react with amino acid side chains to form covalent adducts.

<p>Irreversible inhibition is different from irreversible enzyme inactivation. Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for one class of enzyme and do not inactivate all proteins; they do not function by destroying <a href="/wiki/Protein_structure" id="w">protein structure</a> but by specifically altering the active site of their target. For example, extremes of pH or temperature usually cause <a href="/wiki/Denaturation_(biochemistry)" id="w">denaturation</a> of all <a href="/wiki/Protein_structure" id="w">protein structure</a>, but this is a non-specific effect. Similarly, some non-specific chemical treatments destroy protein structure: for example, heating in concentrated <a href="/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid" id="w">hydrochloric acid</a> will hydrolyse the <a href="/wiki/Peptide_bond" id="w">peptide bonds</a> holding proteins together, releasing free amino acids.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

</p>
<p>As shown in the figure to the left, irreversible inhibitors form a reversible non-covalent complex with the enzyme (EI or ESI) and this then reacts to produce the covalently modified &#34;dead-end complex&#34; EI*. The rate at which EI* is formed is called the inactivation rate or <i>k</i><sub>inact</sub>. Since formation of EI may compete with ES, binding of irreversible inhibitors can be prevented by competition either with substrate or with a second, reversible inhibitor. This protection effect is good evidence of a specific reaction of the irreversible inhibitor with the active site.</p>
<p>The binding and inactivation steps of this reaction are investigated by incubating the enzyme with inhibitor and assaying the amount of activity remaining over time. The activity will be decrease in a time-dependent manner, usually following <a href="/wiki/Exponential_decay" id="w">exponential decay</a>. Fitting these data to a <a href="/wiki/Rate_equation" id="w">rate equation</a> gives the rate of inactivation at this concentration of inhibitor. This is done at several different concentrations of inhibitor. If a reversible EI complex is involved the inactivation rate will be saturable and fitting this curve will give <i>k</i><sub>inact</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another method that is widely used in these analyses is <a href="/wiki/Mass_spectrometry" id="w">mass spectrometry</a>. Here, accurate measurement of the mass of the unmodified native enzyme and the inactivated enzyme gives the increase in mass caused by reaction with the inhibitor and shows the stoichiometry of the reaction.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> This is usually done using a <a href="/wiki/MALDI-TOF" id="w">MALDI-TOF</a> mass spectrometer. In a complementary technique, <a href="/wiki/Peptide_mass_fingerprinting" id="w">peptide mass fingerprinting</a> involves digestion of the native and modified protein with a <a href="/wiki/Protease" id="w">protease</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Trypsin" id="w">trypsin</a>.

<p>Not all irreversible inhibitors form covalent adducts with their enzyme targets. Some reversible inhibitors bind so tightly to their target enzyme that they are essentially irreversible. These tight-binding inhibitors may show kinetics similar to covalent irreversible inhibitors. In these cases, some of these inhibitors rapidly bind to the enzyme in a low-affinity EI complex and this then undergoes a slower rearrangement to a very tightly bound EI* complex (see figure above). This kinetic behaviour is called slow-binding.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> This slow rearrangement after binding often involves a <a href="/wiki/Conformational_change" id="w">conformational change</a> as the enzyme &#34;clamps down&#34; around the inhibitor molecule. Examples of slow-binding inhibitors include some important drugs, such <a href="/wiki/Methotrexate" id="w">methotrexate</a>,<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Allopurinol" id="w">allopurinol</a>,<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> and the activated form of <a href="/wiki/Acyclovir" id="w">acyclovir</a>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Diisopropylfluorophosphate" id="w">Diisopropylfluorophosphate</a> (DFP) is shown as an example of an irreversible protease inhibitor in the figure <a href="/wiki/#Irreversible inhibitors" id="w">above right</a>. The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus–fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains bound to the serine in the <a href="/wiki/Catalytic_triad" id="w">active site</a>, deactivating it.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of <a href="/wiki/Acetylcholine_esterase" id="w">acetylcholine esterase</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Synapses" id="w">synapses</a> of neurons, and consequently is a potent neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100 mg.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Suicide_inhibition" id="w">Suicide inhibition</a> is an unusual type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a reactive form in its active site. An example is the inhibitor of <a href="/wiki/Polyamine" id="w">polyamine</a> biosynthesis, <a href="/wiki/Eflornithine" id="w">α-difluoromethylornithine</a> or DFMO, which is an analogue of the amino acid <a href="/wiki/Ornithine" id="w">ornithine</a>, and is used to treat <a href="/wiki/African_trypanosomiasis" id="w">African trypanosomiasis</a> (sleeping sickness). <a href="/wiki/Ornithine_decarboxylase" id="w">Ornithine decarboxylase</a> can catalyse the decarboxylation of DFMO instead of ornithine, as shown above. However, this decarboxylation reaction is followed by the elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a conjugated <a href="/wiki/Imine" id="w">imine</a>, a highly electrophilic species. This reactive form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.<sup id="_ref-Poulin_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Poulin" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since irreversible inhibition often involves the initial formation of a non-covalent EI complex, it is sometimes possible for an inhibitor to bind to an enzyme in more than one way. For example, in the figure showing <a href="/wiki/Trypanothione" id="w">trypanothione reductase</a> from the human protozoan parasite <i><a href="/wiki/Trypanosoma_cruzi" id="w">Trypanosoma cruzi</a></i>, two molecules of an inhibitor called <i>quinacrine mustard</i> are bound in its active site. The top molecule is bound reversibly, but the lower one is bound covalently as it has reacted with an amino acid residue through its <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_mustard" id="w">nitrogen mustard</a> group.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

</p>
<p>New drugs are the products of a long <a href="/wiki/Drug_development" id="w">drug development</a> process, the first step of which is often the discovery of a new enzyme inhibitor. In the past the only way to discover these new inhibitors was by trial and error: screening huge libraries of compounds against a target enzyme and hoping that some useful leads would emerge. This brute force approach is still successful and has even been extended by <a href="/wiki/Combinatorial_chemistry" id="w">combinatorial chemistry</a> approaches that quickly produce large numbers of novel compounds and <a href="/wiki/High-throughput_screening" id="w">high-throughput screening</a> technology to rapidly screen these huge chemical libraries for useful inhibitors.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>More recently, an alternative approach has been applied: <a href="/wiki/Rational_drug_design" id="w">rational drug design</a> uses the <a href="/wiki/Protein_structure" id="w">three-dimensional structure</a> of an enzyme&#39;s active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor. This new inhibitor is then used to try to obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex to show how the molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. Typically, this process aims to produce an inhibitor with a dissociation constant of &#60;10<sup>-9</sup> <a href="/wiki/Concentration#Molarity" id="w">M</a>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

<p>The most common uses for enzyme inhibitors are as drugs to treat disease. Many of these inhibitors target a human enzyme and aim to correct a pathological condition. However, not all drugs are enzyme inhibitors. Some, such as <a href="/wiki/Anticonvulsant" id="w">anti-epileptic drugs</a>, alter enzyme activity by causing more or less of the enzyme to be produced. These effects are called <a href="/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition" id="w">enzyme induction and inhibition</a> and are alterations in <a href="/wiki/Gene_expression" id="w">gene expression</a>, which is unrelated to the type of enzyme inhibition discussed here. Other drugs interact with cellular targets that are not enzymes, such as <a href="/wiki/Ion_channel" id="w">ion channels</a> or <a href="/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)" id="w">membrane receptors</a>.</p>
<p>An example of a medicinal enzyme inhibitor is <a href="/wiki/Sildenafil" id="w">sildenafil</a> (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of <a href="/wiki/CGMP_specific_phosphodiesterase_type_5" id="w">cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5</a>, the enzyme that degrades the <a href="/wiki/Cell_signaling" id="w">signalling</a> molecule <a href="/wiki/Cyclic_guanosine_monophosphate" id="w">cyclic guanosine monophosphate</a>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the <a href="/wiki/Corpus_cavernosum_penis" id="w">corpus cavernosum</a>, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases the activity of the enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Another example of the structural similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target is seen in the figure comparing the drug <a href="/wiki/Methotrexate" id="w">methotrexate</a> to <a href="/wiki/Folic_acid" id="w">folic acid</a>. Folic acid is the oxidised form of the substrate of <a href="/wiki/Dihydrofolate_reductase" id="w">dihydrofolate reductase</a>, an enzyme that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts <a href="/wiki/Thymidine" id="w">thymidine</a> biosynthesis. This block of <a href="/wiki/Nucleotide" id="w">nucleotide</a> biosynthesis is selectively toxic to rapidly growing cells, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer <a href="/wiki/Chemotherapy" id="w">chemotherapy</a>.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Drugs also are used to inhibit enzymes needed for the survival of <a href="/wiki/Pathogen" id="w">pathogens</a>. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick <a href="/wiki/Bacterial_cell_structure" id="w">cell wall</a> made of a net-like polymer called <a href="/wiki/Peptidoglycan" id="w">peptidoglycan</a>. Many antibiotics such as <a href="/wiki/Penicillin" id="w">penicillin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vancomycin" id="w">vancomycin</a> inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and stick form) is shown bound to its target, the <a href="/wiki/Transpeptidase" id="w">transpeptidase</a> from the bacteria <i>Streptomyces</i> R61 (the protein is shown as a <a href="/wiki/Protein_structure" id="w">ribbon-diagram</a>).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Drug_design" id="w">Drug design</a> is facilitated when an enzyme that is essential to the pathogen&#39;s survival is absent or very different in humans. In the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences in the structure of the <a href="/wiki/Ribosome" id="w">ribosomes</a> in bacteria, or how they make <a href="/wiki/Fatty_acid" id="w">fatty acids</a>.</p>
<a id="Metabolic_control" name="Metabolic_control"></a><h3>Metabolic control</h3>
<p>Enzyme inhibitors are also important in metabolic control. Many <a href="/wiki/Metabolic_pathway" id="w">metabolic pathways</a> in the cell are inhibited by <a href="/wiki/Metabolite" id="w">metabolites</a> that control enzyme activity through <a href="/wiki/Allosteric_regulation" id="w">allosteric regulation</a> or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the <a href="/wiki/Glycolysis" id="w">glycolytic pathway</a>. This <a href="/wiki/Catabolism" id="w">catabolic</a> pathway consumes <a href="/wiki/Glucose" id="w">glucose</a> and produces <a href="/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate" id="w">ATP</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide" id="w">NADH</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pyruvate" id="w">pyruvate</a>. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by <a href="/wiki/Phosphofructokinase" id="w">phosphofructokinase-1</a> (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease the rate of the enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This <a href="/wiki/Feedback" id="w">negative feedback</a> control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, <a href="/wiki/Fructose_2%2C6-bisphosphate" id="w">fructose 2,6-bisphosphate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate" id="w">ADP</a> are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Physiological enzyme inhibition can also be produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the <a href="/wiki/Pancreas" id="w">pancreas</a>, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as <a href="/wiki/Zymogen" id="w">zymogens</a>. Many of these are activated by the <a href="/wiki/Trypsin" id="w">trypsin</a> protease, so it is important to inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent <a href="/wiki/Trypsin_inhibitor" id="w">trypsin inhibitor</a> protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin&#39;s active site and destabilising the transition state.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the <a href="/wiki/Barstar" id="w">barstar</a> inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease <a href="/wiki/Barnase" id="w">barnase</a><sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> and the inhibitors of <a href="/wiki/Protein_phosphatase" id="w">protein phosphatases</a>.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Acetylcholinesterase_inhibitors" name="Acetylcholinesterase_inhibitors"></a><h3> Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors </h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase" id="w">Acetylcholinesterase</a> (AChE) is an enzyme found in animals from insects to humans.  It is essential to nerve cell function through its mechanism of breaking down the neurotransmitter <a href="/wiki/Acetylcholine" id="w">acetylcholine</a> into its constituents, <a href="/wiki/Acetate" id="w">acetate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Choline" id="w">choline</a>.  This is somewhat unique among neurotransmitters as most, including <a href="/wiki/Serotonin" id="w">serotonin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dopamine" id="w">dopamine</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Norepinephrine" id="w">norepinephrine</a>, are absorbed from the <a href="/wiki/Synaptic_cleft" id="w">synaptic cleft</a> rather than cleaved.  A large number of AChE inhibitors are used in both medicine and agriculture.  Reversible competitive inhibitors, such as <a href="/wiki/Edrophonium" id="w">edrophonium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Physostigmine" id="w">physostigmine</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Neostigmine" id="w">neostigmine</a>, are used in the treatment of <a href="/wiki/Myasthenia_gravis" id="w">myasthenia gravis</a> and in anaesthesia.  The <a href="/wiki/Carbamate" id="w">carbamate</a> pesticides are also examples of reversible AChE inhibitors.  The <a href="/wiki/Organophosphate" id="w">organophosphate</a> insecticides such as <a href="/wiki/Malathion" id="w">malathion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Parathion" id="w">parathion</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Chlorpyrifos" id="w">chlorpyrifos</a> irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase.</p>

</p><a id="Natural_poisons" name="Natural_poisons"></a><h3>Natural poisons</h3>
<p>Animals and plants have evolved to synthesize a vast array of poisonous products including <a href="/wiki/Secondary_metabolite" id="w">secondary metabolites</a>, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, <a href="/wiki/Paclitaxel" id="w">paclitaxel</a> (taxol), an organic molecule found in the <a href="/wiki/Taxus" id="w">Pacific yew tree</a>, binds tightly to <a href="/wiki/Tubulin" id="w">tubulin</a> dimers and inhibits their assembly into <a href="/wiki/Microtubule" id="w">microtubules</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Cytoskeleton" id="w">cytoskeleton</a>.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many natural poisons act as <a href="/wiki/Neurotoxin" id="w">neurotoxins</a> that can cause <a href="/wiki/Paralysis" id="w">paralysis</a> leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> An example of a neurotoxin are the <a href="/wiki/Glycoalkaloid" id="w">glycoalkaloids</a>, from the plant species in the <i><a href="/wiki/Solanaceae" id="w">Solanaceae</a></i> family (includes <a href="/wiki/Potato" id="w">potato</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tomato" id="w">tomato</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eggplant" id="w">eggplant</a>), that are <a href="/wiki/Cholinesterase" id="w">acetylcholinesterase</a> inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, <a href="/wiki/Atropine" id="w">atropine</a> from deadly nightshade (<i><a href="/wiki/Atropa_belladonna" id="w">Atropa belladonna</a></i>) that functions as a <a href="/wiki/Competitive_antagonist" id="w">competitive antagonist</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Acetylcholine_receptor" id="w">muscarinic acetylcholine receptors</a>.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although many natural toxins are secondary metabolites, these poisons also include peptides and proteins. An example of a toxic peptide is <a href="/wiki/Alpha-amanitin" id="w">alpha-amanitin</a>, which is found in relatives of the <a href="/wiki/Death_cap" id="w">death cap</a> mushroom. This is a potent enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the <a href="/wiki/RNA_polymerase_II" id="w">RNA polymerase II</a> enzyme from transcribing DNA.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> The algal toxin <a href="/wiki/Microcystin" id="w">microcystin</a> is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of <a href="/wiki/Protein_phosphatase" id="w">protein phosphatases</a>.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> This toxin can contaminate water supplies after <a href="/wiki/Algal_bloom" id="w">algal blooms</a> and is a known carcinogen that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>Proteins can also be natural poisons, such as the <a href="/wiki/Trypsin_inhibitor" id="w">trypsin inhibitors</a> (discussed above) that are found in some <a href="/wiki/Pulse_(legume)" id="w">legumes</a>, as shown in the figure above. A less common class of toxins are toxic enzymes: these act as irreversible inhibitors of their target enzymes and work by chemically modifying their substrate enzymes. An example is <a href="/wiki/Ricin" id="w">ricin</a>, an extremely potent protein toxin found in <a href="/wiki/Castor_oil_plant" id="w">castor oil beans</a>. This enzyme is a glycosidase that inactivates ribosomes. Since ricin is a catalytic irreversible inhibitor, this allows just a single molecule of ricin to kill a cell.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
