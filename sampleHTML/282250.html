<b>Vanderbilt University</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Private_university" id="w">private</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nonsectarian" id="w">nonsectarian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Co-education" id="w">coeducational</a> <a href="/wiki/Research_university" id="w">research university</a> in <a href="/wiki/Nashville%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Nashville</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tennessee" id="w">Tennessee</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">USA</a>.  Founded in <a href="/wiki/1873" id="w">1873</a>, the university is named for <a href="/wiki/Ship_transport" id="w">shipping</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rail_transport" id="w">rail</a> magnate <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Vanderbilt" id="w">&#34;Commodore&#34; Cornelius Vanderbilt</a>, who provided Vanderbilt its initial <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">$1</a> million endowment despite having never been to the <a href="/wiki/Southern_United_States" id="w">South</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Commodore_(rank)" id="w">Commodore</a> hoped that his gift and the greater work of the university would help to heal the sectional wounds inflicted by the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Vanderbilt comprises four <a href="/wiki/Undergraduate_education" id="w">undergraduate</a> and six graduate schools, enrolling approximately 11,600 students from all 50 <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">U.S. states</a> and over 50 foreign countries. In its <a href="/wiki/2008" id="w">2008</a> ranking of universities, <i><a href="/wiki/U.S._News_%26amp%3B_World_Report" id="w">U.S. News &#38; World Report</a></i> placed Vanderbilt 19th overall, and ranked the schools of education, law, medicine, and nursing among the top 20 in the country. The university is among the top 25 recipients of federal educational research funds. Also affiliated with the university are several research institutes, the <a href="/wiki/Freedom_Forum" id="w">Freedom Forum</a> <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment_Center" id="w">First Amendment Center</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Dyer_Observatory" id="w">Dyer Observatory</a>, and the comprehensive <a href="/wiki/Vanderbilt_University_Medical_Center" id="w">Vanderbilt University Medical Center</a> (VUMC), the only <a href="/wiki/Level_I_trauma_center" id="w">Level I trauma center</a> in Middle Tennessee.</p>
<p>With the exception of the off-campus <a href="/wiki/Observatory" id="w">observatory</a>, all of Vanderbilt&#39;s facilities are situated on a {{convert}} plot in the heart of Nashville only {{convert}} from downtown. Despite its <a href="/wiki/Urban" id="w">urban</a> surroundings, the campus itself is a national <a href="/wiki/Arboretum" id="w">arboretum</a> and features over 300 species of trees and shrubs. Tucked among the trees, however, is an institution that continues to grow.  As part of its transition to a <a href="/wiki/Residential_college" id="w">residential college</a> system, Vanderbilt is creating a new living area for <a href="/wiki/First_year" id="w">freshmen</a>, called The Commons, that will comprise 10 new or newly-renovated residence halls. The Commons is expected to open in the fall of 2008, at a cost of over <a href="/wiki/USD" id="w">USD</a>$150 million.</p>

In the years prior to the American Civil War, the <a href="/wiki/Methodist_Episcopal_Church%2C_South" id="w">Methodist Episcopal Church, South</a> had been considering creating a regional university for the training of <a href="/wiki/Minister_(Christianity)" id="w">ministers</a> located centrally for the <a href="/wiki/Congregation" id="w">congregations</a> of the church. Through the lobbying of Nashville bishop <a href="/wiki/Holland_Nimmons_McTyeire" id="w">Holland McTyeire</a>, church leaders voted in <a href="/wiki/1872" id="w">1872</a> to create &#34;Central University&#34; in Nashville. However, lack of funds and the war-ravaged state of the South delayed the opening of the college. </p>
<p>The following year, on a medical trip to <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>, McTyeire stayed at the residence of <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Vanderbilt" id="w">Cornelius Vanderbilt</a>, whose second wife was the cousin of McTyeire&#39;s wife.  Vanderbilt, the wealthiest man in <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" id="w">America</a> at the time, had been considering <a href="/wiki/Philanthropy" id="w">philanthropic</a> causes as he was at an advanced age. His original plan was to establish a university on <a href="/wiki/Staten_Island" id="w">Staten Island</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York_(state)" id="w">New York</a>, in honor of his mother. McTyeire, however, successfully convinced him to donate USD$500,000 to endow Central University in order to &#34;contribute to strengthening the ties which should exist between all sections of our common country.&#34;<sup id="_ref-VUhistory_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VUhistory" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The endowment (later increased to USD$1 million) would be Vanderbilt&#39;s only philanthropy.  Though the Commodore never expressed any desire to have the university named after himself, McTyeire and his fellow trustees soon rechristened the school as &#34;the Vanderbilt University.&#34;  Vanderbilt died in <a href="/wiki/1877" id="w">1877</a> having never even visited the school named after him.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Bishop Holland McTyeire</div> the fall of <a href="/wiki/1875" id="w">1875</a>, about 200 students enrolled at Vanderbilt; the university was dedicated in October of that year.  Bishop McTyeire, who had been named chairman of the Board of Trust for life by Vanderbilt as a stipulation of his endowment, named <a href="/wiki/Landon_Garland" id="w">Landon Garland</a>, his <a href="/wiki/Mentor" id="w">mentor</a> from <a href="/wiki/Randolph-Macon_College" id="w">Randolph-Macon College</a> in <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a> and then-<a href="/wiki/Chancellor_(education)" id="w">Chancellor</a> of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Mississippi" id="w">University of Mississippi</a>, as <a href="/wiki/Chancellor" id="w">chancellor</a>. Garland shaped the school&#39;s structure and hired the school&#39;s faculty, many of whom were renowned scholars in their respective fields.<sup id="_ref-VUhistory_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VUhistory" title="">[1]</a></sup> However, most of this crop of star <a href="/wiki/Faculty" id="w">faculty</a> left after disputes with Bishop McTyeire.</p>
<p>For the first 40 years, the Board of Trust (and therefore the university itself) was under the control of the General Conference (the governing body) of the <a href="/wiki/Methodist_Episcopal_Church" id="w">Methodist Episcopal Church</a>, South. However, tensions began rising between the university administration and the Conference over the future of the school, particularly over the methods by which members of the Vanderbilt Board of Trust would be chosen.  </p>
<p>Conflicts escalated with the appointment of James Kirkland as chancellor in <a href="/wiki/1893" id="w">1893</a>.  The final straw, at least in the mind of Kirkland, was a failed campaign to raise USD$300,000 from Southern Methodist congregations (only $50,000 was raised).  Further disputes between the bishops and Kirkland, which erupted into litigation in <a href="/wiki/1912" id="w">1912</a>, led the Methodist conference to sever all ties with Vanderbilt University in June <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a>.<sup id="_ref-VUhistory_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VUhistory" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Vanderbilt enjoyed early intellectual influence during the <a href="/wiki/1920s" id="w">1920s</a> and <a href="/wiki/1930s" id="w">1930s</a> when it hosted two partly overlapping groups of scholars who had a large impact on American thought and letters: the <a href="/wiki/Fugitives_(poets)" id="w">Fugitives</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Agrarians" id="w">Agrarians</a>.  During the same period, <a href="/wiki/Ernest_William_Goodpasture" id="w">Ernest William Goodpasture</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Collegiality" id="w">colleagues</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Medical_School" id="w">Medical School</a> invented methods for cultivating <a href="/wiki/Viruses" id="w">viruses</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rickettsiae" id="w">rickettsiae</a> in fertilized chicken eggs. This work made possible the production of <a href="/wiki/Vaccine" id="w">vaccines</a> against <a href="/wiki/Chicken_pox" id="w">chicken pox</a>, <a href="/wiki/Smallpox" id="w">smallpox</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yellow_fever" id="w">yellow fever</a>, <a href="/wiki/Typhus" id="w">typhus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rocky_mountain_spotted_fever" id="w">Rocky mountain spotted fever</a> and other diseases caused by agents that only propagate in living cells.</p>
<p>In the late <a href="/wiki/1950s" id="w">1950s</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Vanderbilt_Divinity_School" id="w">Vanderbilt Divinity School</a> became something of a hotbed of the emerging <a href="/wiki/Civil_Rights_movement" id="w">Civil Rights movement</a>, and the university <a href="/wiki/Expulsion" id="w">expelled</a> one of its leaders, <a href="/wiki/James_Lawson" id="w">James Lawson</a>.  Much later, in 2005, he was made a Distinguished Alumnus for his achievements and re-hired as a Distinguished University Professor for the 2006-07 academic year.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>As with Lawson, the university drew national attention in <a href="/wiki/1966" id="w">1966</a>, when it recruited the first <a href="/wiki/African_American" id="w">African American</a> athlete in the Southeastern Conference, Perry Wallace.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Wallace, from Nashville, played varsity basketball for Vanderbilt from <a href="/wiki/1967" id="w">1967</a>-<a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a>, and faced considerable opposition from segregationists when playing at other SEC venues.  In  2004, a student-led drive to have Wallace&#39;s jersey retired finally succeeded. <a href="/wiki/Harold_Vanderbilt" id="w">Harold Vanderbilt</a> was president of the Board of Trust between <a href="/wiki/1955" id="w">1955</a> and <a href="/wiki/1968" id="w">1968</a> when <a href="/wiki/Racial_integration" id="w">racial integration</a> was a very prominent topic at the school. Today a statue of him in front of Buttrick Hall <a href="/wiki/Memorial" id="w">memorializes</a> his efforts.</p>
<p>In 1966, Oberlin Graduate School of Theology moved from Ohio to Nashville, in order to merge with the Vanderbilt Divinity School. In <a href="/wiki/1979" id="w">1979</a>, Vanderbilt absorbed its neighbor, <a href="/wiki/Peabody_College" id="w">Peabody College</a>.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Memorial Hall, located on the Peabody campus, was the subject of a lawsuit to remove the word <i>Confederate</i> from its façade.</div>
History, race, and civil rights issues again came to the fore on the campus in <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, when the university decided to rename a dormitory on the Peabody campus, Confederate Memorial Hall, to Memorial Hall.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Nationwide attention resulted, in part due to a lawsuit by the Tennessee chapter of the <a href="/wiki/United_Daughters_of_the_Confederacy" id="w">United Daughters of the Confederacy</a>, who had helped pay for the building&#39;s construction in <a href="/wiki/1933" id="w">1933</a> with a $50,000 contribution.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Davidson County Chancery Court dismissed the lawsuit in <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>, but the Tennessee Court of Appeals ruled in May <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> that the university would have to pay damages based on the present value of the United Daughters of the Confederacy&#39;s contribution if an inscription bearing the name &#34;Confederate Memorial Hall&#34; were to be removed from the building or altered.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In late July 2005, the university announced that although it has officially renamed the building and all university publications and offices will refer to it solely as &#34;Memorial Hall,&#34; the university would neither appeal the matter further nor remove the inscription and pay damages.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

Vanderbilt University, as a private corporation, is wholly governed by an independent, self-perpetuating Board of Trust. The board comprises 45 regular members (plus any number of trustees emeriti) and the <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_(education)" id="w">chancellor</a>, the university&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" id="w">chief executive officer</a>. Each trustee serves a five-year term (except for four recently-graduated undergraduates, who serve four-year terms). A complete, up-to-date listing of the members of the Board of Trust can be found <a class="externallink" href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/boardoftrust/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/boardoftrust/">here</a>. <a href="/wiki/Martha_Rivers_Ingram" id="w">Martha Rivers Ingram</a> is the board&#39;s current <a href="/wiki/Chairman" id="w">chairman</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Nicholas_S._Zeppos" id="w">Nicholas S. Zeppos</a> currently serves as interim chancellor of Vanderbilt University.  He was appointed to replace the departing <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Gee" id="w">Gordon Gee</a> who left to assume the presidency of <a href="/wiki/Ohio_State_University" id="w">Ohio State University</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_1" id="w">August 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gee had been appointed chancellor by the Board of Trust in February <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a>.  Prior to this appointment, he was the president of <a href="/wiki/Brown_University" id="w">Brown University</a> in <a href="/wiki/Providence%2C_Rhode_Island" id="w">Providence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rhode_Island" id="w">Rhode Island</a>.  Controversy arose in 2006 over Gee&#39;s spending during his tenure at Vanderbilt, including the over $6 million spent on remodeling his university-owned house.  An article in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal" id="w">The Wall Street Journal</a></i> in September of that year criticizing the spending of college and university executives used Gee and Vanderbilt as an example of the lax oversight common to higher education.  The article also revealed that Gee&#39;s wife, a tenured professor, smoked <a href="/wiki/Marijuana" id="w">marijuana</a> in their home.  The Board of Trust has since established a committee to monitor more closely Gee&#39;s spending.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since the opening of the university in 1875, only six other individuals have served as chancellor.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>  Landon Garland was the university&#39;s first chancellor, serving from <a href="/wiki/1875" id="w">1875</a> to <a href="/wiki/1893" id="w">1893</a>.  Garland organized the university and hired its first faculty.  Garland Hall, an academic building on campus, is named in his honor.</p>

He was responsible for severing the university&#39;s ties with the Methodist church and relocating the medical school to the main campus.  Vanderbilt&#39;s Main Building was renamed Kirkland Hall after Kirkland left in 1937.</p>
<p>The longest-tenured chancellor was followed by the second shortest-tenured.  <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Carmichael" id="w">Oliver Carmichael</a> served Vanderbilt for just 9 years, 1937 to 1946.  Carmichael developed the graduate school, and established the Joint University Libraries for Vanderbilt, Peabody, and <a href="/wiki/Scarritt_College" id="w">Scarritt College</a>.  Carmichael Towers, a set of high-rise dormitories on the northern edge of campus, were named for Chancellor Carmichael.</p>
<p>Carmichael&#39;s successor was <a href="/wiki/Harvie_Branscomb" id="w">Harvie Branscomb</a>.  Branscomb presided over a period of major growth and improvement at the university that lasted from 1946 until 1963.  He was responsible for opening the admissions policy to all races.  Branscomb Quadrangle is a residence hall complex named for the chancellor.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/G._Alexander_Heard" id="w">Alexander Heard</a>, for whom the campus library system is named, served as chancellor from 1963 to 1982.  During his twenty-year tenure, the <a href="/wiki/Owen_Graduate_School_of_Management" id="w">Owen Graduate School of Management</a> was founded, and Vanderbilt&#39;s merger with Peabody College was negotiated. He also survived calls for his ouster because of his accommodating stance on desegregation.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Joe_B._Wyatt" id="w">Joe B. Wyatt</a> was the chancellor who served immediately before Gee, from 1982 until 2000.  Wyatt oversaw a great increase in the university&#39;s endowment, an increase in student diversity, and the renovation of many campus buildings.

The Vanderbilt campus is located approximately {{convert}} west of downtown in the West End neighborhood of midtown Nashville. It has an area of {{convert}}, though this figure includes large tracts of sparsely used land in the southwest part of the main campus, as well as the Medical Center.  The historical core of campus encompasses approximately {{convert}}. The Vanderbilt campus is roughly fan-shaped (with the point at the corner of West End and 21st Avenues) and reflects the university&#39;s gradual expansion to the south and to the west. The campus is fairly compact, however, and the farthest distance on campus takes about 25 minutes to walk.</p>
<p>The oldest part of the Vanderbilt campus is known for its abundance of trees and green space, which stand in contrast to the surrounding cityscape of urban Nashville. The campus was designated as a national arboretum in 1988 by the Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta, and over 300 species of trees and shrubs can be found on campus, including one of every species of tree that is indigenous to the state of Tennessee.<sup id="_ref-campus map_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-campus map" title="">[28]</a></sup> One tree, the Bicentennial Oak between Rand Hall and Garland Hall, is certified to have lived during the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution" id="w">American Revolution</a> and is the oldest living thing on the campus.</p>
<a id="Main_campus" name="Main_campus"></a><h2>Main campus</h2>
<p>In the northeast corner of the campus (the &#34;base&#34; of the fan) is the original campus. The first college buildings, including Kirkland Hall, were erected here in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s. This section stretches from West End Avenue south to the Stevenson Center and west from 21st Avenue to Alumni Lawn.  The majority of the buildings of the arts and humanities departments of the College of Arts and Science, as well as the facilities of the Law School, Owen Graduate School of Management, and the Divinity School, are located in the original campus. Additionally, the Heard Central Library and Sarratt Student Center/Rand Hall can be found on the original campus.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Bicentennial Oak, facing Buttrick Hall</div>
Flanking the original campus to the south are the Stevenson Center for Science and Mathematics and the School of Engineering complex (Jacobs Hall-Featheringill Hall). Housing the Science Library, the School of Engineering, and all the science and math departments of the College of Arts and Science, save for psychology, this complex sits between the original campus and the Medical Center. The Vanderbilt University Medical Center itself takes up the southeastern part of the campus. Besides the various associated hospitals and clinics and the facilities of the Schools of Medicine and Nursing, the medical center also houses many major research facilities. </p>

West of the original campus and the Medical Center, Greek Row and the bulk of the Vanderbilt residence halls are found.  From north to south, Carmichael Towers, Greek Row, Branscomb Quadrangle, and Highland Quadrangle house the vast majority of on-campus residents in facilities ranging from the double-occupancy shared-bathroom dorms in Branscomb and Towers to the apartments and lodges in Highland Quadrangle. This part of campus is newer than the others; Vanderbilt&#39;s westward growth did not start until the 1950s. This portion of campus was built by tearing down small single family houses and duplexes dating from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, and so the area has significantly less green space than the arboretum on the original campus and is more indicative of the university&#39;s urban locale.</p>

Directly across 21st Avenue from the Medical Center sits the campus of the Peabody College of Education and Human Development. Due to their separate histories until the merger, the Peabody campus was configured in a radically different style than the original Vanderbilt campus. Whereas the latter has an unplanned organic design with buildings scattered throughout, Peabody campus was planned as a geometric design, similar to the <a href="/wiki/Jeffersonian_architecture" id="w">Jeffersonian</a> style of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Virginia" id="w">University of Virginia</a>.  The campus is home not only to Peabody College but also to the future Commons, where all freshmen will live together as part of the <a href="/wiki/Vanderbilt_University#College halls" id="w">College Halls</a> plan.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of an organized journalism curriculum, no less than ten editorially-independent media outlets are produced and controlled by students. In addition, a sportswriting scholarship, named for Vanderbilt alumni <a href="/wiki/Fred_Russell" id="w">Fred Russell</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grantland_Rice" id="w">Grantland Rice</a>, is awarded each year to an entering Vanderbilt freshman who intends to pursue a career in sportswriting. Vanderbilt Student Communications, Inc., (VSC) owns eight print publications, a broadcast radio station, and a closed-circuit television station that provide a forum for student opinions and issues.  One publication, <i>The Vanderbilt Hustler</i>, was established in 1888 and is the oldest continuously published newspaper in <a href="/wiki/Nashville" id="w">Nashville</a> (the newspaper&#39;s name references another nickname for the Commodore based on his cutthroat business practices, <i>i.e.</i>, that he &#34;hustled&#34; people out of their money).

<p>VSC was formed as a not-for-profit corporation in 1967 to insulate the university from potential liability and to maintain journalistic independence after a series of controversial articles published by <i>The Hustler</i>.  During the 1970s, VSC funded a visiting journalist position to provide advice and counsel to its various operating units.

<a id="Honor_Code" name="Honor_Code"></a><h2>Honor Code</h2>
<p>Since the first classes began at Vanderbilt, the Honor System has served to strengthen the academic integrity of the university.  Its principles were outlined in a famous quote by long-time Dean of Students Madison Sarratt:<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> {{quote}}</p>
<p>As a part of their first act together as a class, each Vanderbilt class meets together at the Honor Code Signing Ceremony, where every member of the class pledges their honor and signs the code.  The signature pages are then hung in the Student Center.  The ceremony is one of only two occasions where a class will be congregated in a single place at the same time (the other being Commencement).</p>
<p>The Undergraduate Honor Council was formed to help enforce and protect the tradition of the Honor Code. Today, the Honor Council serves two simultaneous aims: to enforce and protect the Honor Code and to inform members of the Vanderbilt community about the Honor System.</p>

All undergraduate students not living with relatives in <a href="/wiki/Davidson_County%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Davidson County</a> are required to live on campus all four years to the extent that on-campus student housing facilities can accommodate them. In practice, though, approximately 83% of undergraduates&#8212;freshmen, sophomores, nearly all juniors and most seniors&#8212;currently live on campus.  The remaining undergraduates join graduate and professional students in living off-campus. Student life at Vanderbilt is consequently heavily intertwined with campus life.</p>

However, the on-campus residential system is currently undergoing a radical change.  The new system, announced by the administration in <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, would change the current structure of quadrangle-based residence halls to a new system of residential colleges, to be called &#34;College Halls&#34;. Similar to the residential structures at <a href="/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology" id="w">Caltech</a>, <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" id="w">Harvard</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rice_University" id="w">Rice</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Yale_University" id="w">Yale</a>, the new College Halls system would create residence halls where students and faculty would live together in a self-contained environment, complete with study rooms, cafeterias, laundry facilities, and stores. This project is now underway and is scheduled to be completed within the next twenty years.</p>
<p>The first step in the College Halls system will be The Commons, a collection of ten residential halls on the Peabody campus that will house all first-year students beginning in the fall of 2008.  While the university currently houses freshmen in three separate and distinct residential areas, it is hoped that The Commons will give first-year students a unified (and unifying) living-learning experience. Five existing dormitories on Peabody have been renovated, and the university is in the process of building five new ones.  Two of the new residence halls have received <a href="/wiki/Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design" id="w">LEED</a> silver certification, making Vanderbilt the only university in the state to be recognized by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Green_Building_Council" id="w">U.S. Green Building Council</a>.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>  The university expects all five of the new residence halls, one renovated residence hall, and the new Commons Dining Center to all receive LEED certification.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup>  The total cost of The Commons construction project is expected to be over $150 million.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the addition of these new residence halls, the university will be able to house all undergraduate students on campus. Since university policy requires undergraduates to live on campus when possible, Vanderbilt&#39;s Office of Housing and Residential Education will no longer grant students permission to live off campus, beginning with the class graduating in 2009.<sup id="_ref-commons_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-commons" title="">[35]</a></sup> Many current students who came to Vanderbilt with the understanding that seniors were generally allowed to live off campus are now disappointed that they must live on campus all four years.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> However, university administrators believe the undergraduate community receives the greatest benefit from living in on-campus residence halls, citing increased interaction with faculty, better academic performance, and stronger interpersonal relationships.<sup id="_ref-commons_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-commons" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

Vanderbilt is a charter member of the <a href="/wiki/Southeastern_Conference" id="w">Southeastern Conference</a> and is the conference&#39;s only private school. With fewer than 6,400 undergraduates, the school is also the smallest in the conference; University of Mississippi has nearly twice as many undergraduate students.

In September 2003, Vanderbilt earned national attention when it announced that it was eliminating its athletic department. Gee called Vanderbilt&#39;s varsity athletes &#34;isolated,&#34; and insisted that student-athletes would perform better if they were integrated into the rest of the student body. So rather than administer athletics separately from student life, Gee folded the university&#39;s varsity teams into the Office of Student Life, the same group that oversees all student organizations. The university is unique in Division I in this regard.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Despite fears that Vanderbilt would lose coaches and recruits or would be forced out of the SEC, the university has experienced considerable success since the change; 2006&#8211;2007 was one of the best in the school&#39;s athletic history.  At one point, seven of Vanderbilt&#39;s 16 teams were ranked in the Top 25 of their respective sports.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup>  Women&#39;s bowling won the NCAA championship, bringing the university its first and only team championship since the advent of the NCAA.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> The baseball team qualified for the NCAA Super Regionals in 2004, had the nation&#39;s top recruiting class in 2005 according to <i><a href="/wiki/Baseball_America" id="w">Baseball America</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> made the NCAA field again in 2006, and won the 2007 SEC regular-season and tournament championships.  Vanderbilt was ranked first in most polls for a large portion of the 2007 season, and the team secured the top seed in the <a href="/wiki/2007_NCAA_Division_I_Baseball_Tournament" id="w">2007 NCAA tournament</a>.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Mascot" name="Mascot"></a><h2>Mascot</h2>
<p>Vanderbilt&#39;s intercollegiate athletics teams are nicknamed the Commodores, in honor of the nickname given to Cornelius Vanderbilt, who made his fortune in shipping.  Students and alumni refer to Vanderbilt athletic teams as &#34;Dores&#34; or use the cheer &#34;Go Dores!&#34; </p>
<p>The term <i><a href="/wiki/Commodore_(rank)" id="w">commodore</a></i> was used by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" id="w">Navy</a> during the mid- to late-nineteenth century.  A commodore was the commanding officer of a task force of ships, and therefore higher in rank than a captain but lower in rank than an admiral. The closest parallel to this now-defunct rank is <a href="/wiki/Rear_admiral#United States" id="w">rear admiral lower-half</a>.  Since the term was used most during the 19th century, Vanderbilt&#39;s mascot is usually portrayed as a naval officer from the late 1800s, complete with <a href="/wiki/Sideburns" id="w">mutton chops</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cutlass" id="w">cutlass</a>, and uniform.</p>
