The idea of Georgia Institute of Technology was introduced in 1865 during the <a href="/wiki/Reconstruction" id="w">Reconstruction</a> period. Two former <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" id="w">Confederate</a> officers, Major <a href="/wiki/John_Fletcher_Hanson" id="w">John Fletcher Hanson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nathaniel_Edwin_Harris" id="w">Nathaniel Edwin Harris</a>, who had become prominent citizens in the town of <a href="/wiki/Macon%2C_Georgia" id="w">Macon, Georgia</a> after the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">war</a>, strongly believed that the South needed to improve its technology to compete with the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" id="w">industrial revolution</a> that was occurring throughout the North.<sup id="_ref-Hopkins_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hopkins" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-gws_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gws" title="">[3]</a></sup> Many Southerners at this time agreed with this idea. However, because the American South of that era was mainly comprised of agricultural workers and few technical developments were occurring, a technology school was needed.<sup id="_ref-Hopkins_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hopkins" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-gws_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gws" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1882, prominent Georgians, authorized by the <a href="/wiki/Georgia_State_Legislature" id="w">Georgia State Legislature</a> and led by Harris, formed a committee and visited the Northeast to see firsthand how technology schools worked. Using examples from the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science (now <a href="/wiki/Worcester_Polytechnic_Institute" id="w">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>) and the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" id="w">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, the Atlanta technology school began development on the Worcester Free Institute model, which stressed a combination of &#34;theory and practice,&#34; the &#34;practice&#34; component including student employment and production of consumer items to generate revenue for the school.<sup id="_ref-NewSouthCreed_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NewSouthCreed" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_13" id="w">October 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1885" id="w">1885</a>, <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Georgia" id="w">Georgia Governor</a> <a href="/wiki/Henry_D._McDaniel" id="w">Henry D.

<a id="Industry_connections" name="Industry_connections"></a><h3> Industry connections </h3>
<p>Owing to its roots as a <a href="/wiki/Vocational_school" id="w">trade school</a>, Georgia Tech maintains close ties to the industrial world. Many of these connections are made through Georgia Tech&#39;s uniquely popular and robust <a href="/wiki/Cooperative_education" id="w">cooperative education</a> and <a href="/wiki/Intern" id="w">internship</a> programs. Georgia Tech&#39;s Division of Professional Practice (DoPP), established in 1912 as the Georgia Institute of Technology Cooperative Division,<sup id="_ref-DoPPhonor_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DoPPhonor" title="">[40]</a></sup> operates the fourth-oldest cooperative education program in the United States.<sup id="_ref-DoPPhome_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DoPPhome" title="">[41]</a></sup> The DoPP is specifically charged with providing opportunities for students to gain real-world <a href="/wiki/Employment" id="w">employment</a> experience through four programs, each targeting a different body of students. The Undergraduate Cooperative Education Program is a five-year program in which <a href="/wiki/Undergraduate_education" id="w">undergraduate students</a> alternate between semesters of formal instruction at Georgia Tech and semesters of full-time employment with their employers. The Graduate Cooperative Education Program, established in 1983, is the largest such program in the United States.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> It allows <a href="/wiki/Graduate_school" id="w">graduate students</a> pursuing <a href="/wiki/Master%26%2339%3Bs_degree" id="w">master&#39;s degrees</a> or <a href="/wiki/Doctorate" id="w">doctorates</a> in any field to spend a maximum of two consecutive semesters working full- or part-time with employers. The Undergraduate Professional Internship Program enables undergraduate students — typically juniors or seniors — to complete a one- or two-semester internship with employers. The Work Abroad Program hosts a variety of cooperative education and internship experiences for upperclassmen and graduate students seeking international employment and cross-cultural experiences. While all four programs are voluntary, they consistently attract high numbers of students — more than 3,000 at last count. Around 1,000 businesses and organizations hire these students, who collectively earn $20 million per year.<sup id="_ref-DoPPhome_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DoPPhome" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Georgia Tech&#39;s cooperative education and internship programs have been externally recognized for their strengths. The Undergraduate Cooperative Education was recognized by <i><a href="/wiki/U.S._News_%26amp%3B_World_Report" id="w">U.S. News &#38; World Report</a></i> as one of the top 10 &#34;Programs that Really Work&#34; for five consecutive years.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> <i>U.S. News &#38; World Report</i> additionally ranked Georgia Tech&#39;s internship and cooperative education programs among 14 &#34;Academic Programs to Look For&#34; in 2006 and 2007.<sup id="_ref-highest_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-highest" title="">[29]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/June_4" id="w">June 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Cincinnati" id="w">University of Cincinnati</a> inducted Georgia Tech into its Cooperative Education Hall of Honor.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

Tech has a number of legends and traditions, some of which have persisted for decades. Some are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the &#39;T&#39; from Tech Tower. <a href="/wiki/Tech_Tower" id="w">Tech Tower</a>, Tech&#39;s historic primary administrative building, has the letters TECH hanging atop it on each of its four sides. A number of times, students have orchestrated complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion have carried this act out successfully. The latest instance of this tradition occurred in October 2005, when a replica of the T was stolen from the Student Services Building and returned two days later.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> One of the cherished holdovers from Tech&#39;s early years, a <a href="/wiki/Steam_whistle" id="w">steam whistle</a> blows five minutes before the hour, every hour from 7:55 a.m. to 5:55 p.m.<sup id="_ref-webster2002_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-webster2002" title="">[51]</a></sup> It is for that reason that the faculty newspaper is named <i>The Whistle</i>.<sup id="_ref-webster2004_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-webster2004" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

Herty, the first UGA football coach, felt that <a href="/wiki/Old_gold" id="w">old gold</a> was too similar to <a href="/wiki/Yellow" id="w">yellow</a> and that it &#34;symbolized cowardice.&#34; After the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official school color.<sup id="_ref-ugacolors_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ugacolors" title="">[52]</a></sup> Tech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial slap in the face to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against <a href="/wiki/Auburn_Tigers_football" id="w">Auburn</a> in 1891.<sup id="_ref-rw_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rw" title="">[53]</a></sup> Georgia Tech&#39;s school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.</p>
