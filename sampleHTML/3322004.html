<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h1>Plot</h1>
<p><a href="/wiki/Peter_Griffin" id="w">Peter</a> awakes in the morning to find he has eaten a sheep in his sleep. Undisturbed by the incident, he prepares to leave for work. While backing his car out of the driveway, he hits Brian, who needs treatment at a hospital. Upon Brian&#39;s return, Peter makes too much of an effort to welcome him back into the family. Meanwhile, Meg makes friends with Sarah at her school, unaware that she is about to be offered a place in the Lesbian Alliance Club (LAC). After speaking with <a href="/wiki/Neil_Goldman" id="w">Neil Goldman</a>, Meg realizes that she is now considered a lesbian by the group, and prepares to drop out, however, when she realizes the effect of being a member may have on her sociable status, she pretends to be a lesbian. Meanwhile, Brian becomes depressed after the accident, but after speaking with Frank Sinatra Jr, he begins to perform with him, changing his outlook on life to that of positivity. After being told of Brian&#39;s new lifestyle, the family are impressed and encourage him to continue. However, when he is invited by Sinatra to perform with him again, their duo is interrupted by Stewie, who joins the performance. Meanwhile, Meg tells the family that she is now a lesbian, but is mocked by Lois, knowing that she is not being honest. Meanwhile, Brian and Stewie continue their performances across <a href="/wiki/Quahog_(Family_Guy)" id="w">Quahog</a> with Sinatra, Jr. In a drunken condition following a performance, Brian loses Stewie, which results in Stewie&#39;s ear being bitten off by a deer.

Brian bites his arm, which makes Peter fearful of him.</p>
<p>Brian, regretful of biting Peter, quits performing with Stewie and Sinatra, resorting to drinking wine from a gutter. However, Brian regains his confidence when Stewie searches for him, where he tells Brian that there are things in life which are beyond his control, telling him that even though they aren&#39;t in his control, they do matter, contrary to Brian&#39;s common beliefs. Meanwhile, Meg prepares to tell Sarah that she is not a lesbian and that she only pretended to be in order to make friends; however, Sarah gets undressed, believing Meg to have come to her house to <a href="/wiki/Sexual_intercourse" id="w">sex</a> with her. They are both interrupted by <a href="/wiki/Glen_Quagmire" id="w">Glen Quagmire</a> and his production team filming their antics.<sup id="_ref-Episode_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Episode" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Scripts and other production materials were altered and modified extensively.  The rhythm and pacing of the show required frequent rewrites due to the inclusion of musical performances.<sup id="_ref-Smith_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Smith" title="">[4]</a></sup> MacFarlane comments that &#34;having Frank Sinatra, Jr. on board was a pleasure to the team.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MacFarlane_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacFarlane" title="">[5]</a></sup> Music originally written by <a href="/wiki/John_Williams" id="w">John Williams</a> was used in the episode, however Williams prohibits the usage of his music, so the producers of the show had to re-record it using their own band.

This is the only time on <i>Family Guy</i> when MacFarlane has not voiced Stewie; instead, the laughing was performed by <a href="/wiki/Ricky_Blitt" id="w">Ricky Blitt</a>, a former writer of <i>Family Guy</i>.<sup id="_ref-MacFarlane_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacFarlane" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
