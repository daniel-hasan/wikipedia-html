<p><i>Super Mario 64</i> was the first <a href="/wiki/3D_computer_graphics" id="w">3D</a> platform game in the <i><a href="/wiki/Mario" id="w">Mario</a></i> series, and established a new archetype for the genre, much as <i><a href="/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros." id="w">Super Mario Bros.</a></i> did for <a href="/wiki/2D_computer_graphics" id="w">2D</a> sidescrolling platformers. Hailed as &#34;revolutionary&#34;, the game left a lasting impression on the 3D game design, particularly notable for its use of a dynamic camera system and the implementation of its analog control.<sup id="_ref-gamespotinf_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespotinf" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1up1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1up1" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In going from two to three dimensions, <i>Super Mario 64</i> replaced the linear obstacle courses of traditional platform games with vast worlds in which the player must complete multiple and diverse missions, with an emphasis on exploration. While doing so, it managed to preserve many gameplay elements and characters of earlier <i>Mario</i> games.<sup id="_ref-1up1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1up1" title="">[7]</a></sup> It is acclaimed by many critics and fans as one of the greatest and most revolutionary video games of all time.<sup id="_ref-topgames_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-topgames" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<i>Super Mario 64</i> is a <a href="/wiki/3D_computer_graphics" id="w">3D</a> <a href="/wiki/Platform_game" id="w">platformer</a> where the player controls <a href="/wiki/Mario" id="w">Mario</a> through several courses. Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask a favor. Mario gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after Mario has completed certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a <a href="/wiki/Boss_(video_games)" id="w">boss</a>, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As Mario collects stars, more areas of the castle are opened. Mario unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses.<sup id="_ref-playersguide_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-playersguide" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mario is assisted in some courses by three cap power-ups. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly, the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage and allows him to withstand wind and walk underwater, and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage.<sup id="_ref-playersguide_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-playersguide" title="">[9]</a></sup> Some courses contain <a href="/wiki/Cannon" id="w">cannons</a> that Mario can unlock by speaking to a pink <a href="/wiki/List_of_Mario_series_enemies#Bob-omb" id="w">Bob-omb Buddy</a>. After Mario enters a cannon, he can be shot out to reach distant places. When Mario has the Wing Cap, cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly. There are many hidden secrets to the game, most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Mario can perform a wide range of jumps among other moves.</div>
Mario&#39;s abilities in <i>Super Mario 64</i> are far more diverse than those of previous <i>Mario</i> games. He can walk, run, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, and jump at great heights or distances using the <a href="/wiki/Game_controller" id="w">game controller</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Analog_stick" id="w">analog stick</a> and buttons. As jumping was Mario&#39;s signature move in earlier games, particular attention was paid to this move. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the extra high double and triple jumps; jumping two and three times in a row, respectively, the long jump, and the <a href="/wiki/Somersault" id="w">backflip</a>. There are also special maneuvers, such as <a href="/wiki/Wall_jump" id="w">wall jumping</a>; jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach areas that would otherwise be too high.<sup id="_ref-playersguide_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-playersguide" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-instructions_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-instructions" title="">[10]</a></sup> Mario can pick up and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles. Mario can also swim underwater at various speeds. His life energy slowly diminishes while underwater, representing how long he can hold his breath, and he must find coins or air bubbles to replenish it, or return to the surface before drowning.<sup id="_ref-playersguide_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-playersguide" title="">[9]</a></sup> If Mario surfaces from underwater, he heals all of his damage regardless of the source, with the exception of icy water in some snow levels.</p>
<a id="Plot_and_setting" name="Plot_and_setting"></a><h2>Plot and setting</h2>
<p><i>Super Mario 64</i> is set in <a href="/wiki/Mushroom_Kingdom#Princess Peach&#39;s Castle" id="w">Princess Peach&#39;s Castle</a>, which consists of three floors, a basement, a moat, and a courtyard. The area outside the castle is an introductory area in which the player can experiment. Scattered throughout the castle are entrances to courses and other areas, usually accessed by jumping into a painting. Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits.</p>
<a id="Story" name="Story"></a><h3>Story</h3>
<p><i>Super Mario 64</i> begins with a letter from <a href="/wiki/Princess_Peach" id="w">Princess Peach</a> inviting <a href="/wiki/Mario" id="w">Mario</a> to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. When he arrives, Mario discovers that <a href="/wiki/Bowser_(Nintendo)" id="w">Bowser</a> has invaded the castle and imprisoned the Princess and her servants within it using the power of 105 of the castle&#39;s 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle&#39;s paintings are portals to other realms, in which Bowser&#39;s minions keep watch over the stars.</p>
<p>Mario searches the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more stars, and will have to tackle three obstacle courses leading to a battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle, while the final battle releases Peach and rolls the credits. Peach rewards Mario by baking the cake that she had promised him.<sup id="_ref-playersguide_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-playersguide" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-instructions_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-instructions" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h2>Development</h2>
<p>The development of <i>Super Mario 64</i> took less than two years, but producer/director <a href="/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto" id="w">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> had conceived of a 3D <i>Mario</i> game over five years before, while working on <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Fox_(video_game)" id="w">Star Fox</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-interview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview" title="">[11]</a></sup> Miyamoto developed most of the concepts during the era of the <a href="/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System" id="w">SNES</a> and considered making it a SNES game (making use of the <a href="/wiki/Super_FX" id="w">Super FX</a> chip), but decided to develop it for the Nintendo 64 due to the earlier system&#39;s technical limitations.<sup id="_ref-nsider_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nsider" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Mario64_bowser_level.jpg" title="&#34;Bowser in the Dark World&#34;, one of the linear levels where Mario encounters Bowser."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario64_bowser_level.jpg" alt="&#34;Bowser in the Dark World&#34;, one of the linear levels where Mario encounters Bowser." title="&#34;Bowser in the Dark World&#34;, one of the linear levels where Mario encounters Bowser." class="location-left type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">&#34;Bowser in the Dark World&#34;, one of the linear levels where Mario encounters Bowser.</div></p>
<p>The development of the game started with the creation of the characters and camera system. Shigeru Miyamoto and the other designers were initially unsure of which direction the game should take, and months were spent selecting a camera view and layout that would be appropriate.<sup id="_ref-goddard interview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-goddard interview" title="">[13]</a></sup> The original concept involved the game having fixed path much like an <a href="/wiki/Action-adventure_game#Isometric adventure games" id="w">isometric</a> type game (similar to <i><a href="/wiki/Super_Mario_RPG" id="w">Super Mario RPG</a></i>), before the choice was made to settle on a free-roaming 3D design.<sup id="_ref-goddard interview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-goddard interview" title="">[13]</a></sup> Although the majority of <i>Super Mario 64</i> would end up featuring the free-roaming design, elements of the original fixed path concept would remain in certain parts of the game, particularly in the three Bowser encounters. One of the programmers for <i>Super Mario 64</i>, Giles Goddard, explained that these few linear elements survived as a means to force players into Bowser&#39;s lair rather than to encourage exploration.<sup id="_ref-goddard interview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-goddard interview" title="">[13]</a></sup> The development team placed high priority on getting Mario&#39;s movements right, and before levels were created, the team was testing and refining Mario&#39;s animations on a simple grid. The first test scenario used to try out controls and physics, involved Mario and the golden rabbit, &#34;MIPS&#34;.</p>
<p>Shigeru Miyamoto&#39;s guiding design philosophy behind <i>Super Mario 64</i> was to include more details.<sup id="_ref-interview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview" title="">[11]</a></sup> Many were inspired from real life; for example, one character is based on assistant director <a href="/wiki/Takashi_Tezuka" id="w">Takashi Tezuka</a>&#39;s wife who &#34;is very quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time [Tezuka] spent at work. In the game, there is now a character (Big Boo) which shrinks (or looks semi-transparent) when Mario looks at it, but when Mario turns away, it will grow large and menacing.&#34;<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> <i>Super Mario 64</i> is also characterized by featuring more puzzles than earlier <i>Mario</i> games. It was developed simultaneously with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time" id="w">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></i>, but as the latter was released years later, some puzzles were taken from that game for <i>Super Mario 64</i>.<sup id="_ref-interview2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview2" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>Information about <i>Super Mario 64</i> first leaked out in November 1995, and a playable version of the game was presented days later as part of the world premiere for the Nintendo 64 (then known as the &#34;Ultra 64&#34;) at <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_Space_World" id="w">Nintendo Space World</a>. The basic controls had at this point been implemented, and the game was reportedly 50% finished, although most of the course design remained. There were at least 32 courses planned, but the number turned out lower in the final game, and only 25 courses could fit in the game.<sup id="_ref-interview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Audio" name="Audio"></a><h3>Audio</h3>
<p>The music was composed by veteran <a href="/wiki/Koji_Kondo" id="w">Koji Kondo</a>, who used new interpretations of the familiar melodies from earlier games as well as entirely new material. <i>Super Mario 64</i> was one of the first games in the series to feature <a href="/wiki/Charles_Martinet" id="w">Charles Martinet</a> as the voice of Mario. It also features Leslie Swan as Princess Peach and <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Marshall" id="w">Isaac Marshall</a> as Bowser. The characters speak more in the English version than in the Japanese version.<sup id="_ref-interview2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview2" title="">[15]</a></sup> In addition, dialog and some sounds differ between the Japanese and English versions. Some of these vocal changes for the English release were brought to the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Rumble_Pak" id="w">Rumble Pak</a> edition. When <i><a href="/wiki/Super_Mario_64_DS" id="w">Super Mario 64 DS</a></i> was released, all the voices were kept consistent in both the English and Japanese versions.</p>

<a id="Impact_and_legacy" name="Impact_and_legacy"></a><h2>Impact and legacy</h2>
<p><i>Super Mario 64</i> set many precedents for 3D platformers to follow.<sup id="_ref-1up1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1up1" title="">[7]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/GamesTM" id="w">GamesTM</a> stated that many game companies, including Nintendo, tried to develop a platform game to match up to <i>Super Mario 64</i>.<sup id="_ref-gamesTM-63_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamesTM-63" title="">[30]</a></sup> Most 3D games at the time used a <a href="/wiki/First-person_shooter" id="w">first-person</a> perspective, or a camera that was fixed in position relative to the player&#39;s character, or to the level. In order to create freedom of exploration, and more fluid control in a 3D world, the designers created a dynamic system in which the <a href="/wiki/Professional_video_camera" id="w">video camera</a> was operated by the in-game character <a href="/wiki/List_of_Mario_series_enemies#Lakitu" id="w">Lakitu</a>.<sup id="_ref-instructions_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-instructions" title="">[10]</a></sup> The camera system was the first of its kind in the platform genre, and would become the standard for 3D platformers in the future.<sup id="_ref-npsep96_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-npsep96" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Nintendo 64&#39;s analog stick allowed for more precise and wide-ranging character movements than the digital <a href="/wiki/D-pad" id="w">D-pads</a> of other consoles, and <i>Super Mario 64</i> used this in a way that was unique for its time. At the time, 3D games generally allowed for controls in which the player could either control the character in relation to a fixed camera angle or in relation to the character&#39;s perspective. <i>Super Mario 64</i>&#39;s controls were fully analog, and interpreted a 360 degree range of motion into navigation through a 3D space relative to the camera. The analog control also allowed for subtleties of movement like controlling the speed at which Mario runs.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Super Mario 64</i> was also notable for its sense of freedom and <a href="/wiki/Linearity_(computer_and_video_games)" id="w">non-linearity</a>. A central hub, where controls can be learned before entering levels themselves, has been used in many 3D platformers since. In addition, the game&#39;s mission-based level design was an inspiration for other game designers. For example, <a href="/wiki/Martin_Hollis" id="w">Martin Hollis</a>, who produced and directed <i><a href="/wiki/GoldenEye_007" id="w">GoldenEye 007</a></i>, says that &#34;the idea for the huge variety of missions within a level came from <i>Super Mario 64</i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

<p>Nintendo has consistently denied Luigi&#39;s playability, and never commented on the meaning of &#34;L is real 2401&#34; except for the <a href="/wiki/April_Fools%26%2339%3B_Day" id="w">April Fools&#39; Day</a> 1998 issue of <i><a href="/wiki/Nintendo_Power" id="w">Nintendo Power</a></i>. In this issue, the &#34;April News Briefs&#34; section said that the cryptic phrase would be discussed on page 128, but the magazine had only 106 pages. The section also featured a facetious article entitled &#34;Luigi 64&#34;, commenting humorously on the rumor.<sup id="_ref-npapr98_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-npapr98" title="">[37]</a></sup> Luigi did however become playable in <i><a href="/wiki/Super_Mario_64_DS" id="w">Super Mario 64 DS</a></i>.</p>
