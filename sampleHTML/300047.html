<b>Al Lewis</b> (<a href="/wiki/April_30" id="w">April 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a> <sup id="_ref-SS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SS" title="">[1]</a></sup> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/February_3" id="w">February 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>) was an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> actor best known for his role as &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Munsters#Grandpa" id="w">Grandpa</a>&#34; on the <a href="/wiki/Television_series" id="w">television series</a> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Munsters" id="w">The Munsters</a></i>.  Later in life, he was also a restaurant owner, political candidate, and <a href="/wiki/Broadcasting" id="w">radio broadcaster</a>.</p>
<a id="Parents" name="Parents"></a><h1> Parents </h1>
<p>In a 1998 interview with Walt Shepperd, Al Lewis said:</p><blockquote>
<p>My mother was a worker, worked in the garment trades. My mother was an indomitable spirit. My grandfather had no sons. He had six daughters. They lived in Poland or Russia, every five years it would change. My mother being the oldest daughter, they saved their money, and when she was about 16 they sent her to the United States, not knowing a word of English. She went to work in the garment center, worked her back and rear-end off and brought over to the United States her five sisters and two parents. I remember going on picket lines with my mother. My mother wouldn&#39;t back down to anyone.<sup id="_ref-shepperd_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shepperd" title="">[2]</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>

<p>He stated the same information in an <a href="/wiki/10_April" id="w">10 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a> interview with correspondents <a href="/wiki/Amy_Goodman" id="w">Amy Goodman</a> and Bernard White.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Birth" name="Birth"></a><h1> Birth </h1>
<p>He was born on <a href="/wiki/30_April" id="w">30 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a>,<sup id="_ref-SS_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SS" title="">[1]</a></sup> but few other facts about Lewis are known with any certainty; most of the information comes from interviews he gave, but there are inconsistencies in his testimonies. Sometimes he gave his birth year as 1910, other times 1923. Ted Lewis, his son, said his father was born in 1923. <a href="/wiki/Dan_Barry_(reporter)" id="w">Dan Barry</a> of the <i>New York Times</i> writes: &#34;Actors who lie about their age usually subtract, not add, years, and few would have the nerve to fudge those years by more than a decade.&#34;<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Al may have been born under the name <b>Albert Meister</b> or <b>Alexander Meister</b><sup id="_ref-birthplace_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-birthplace" title="">[5]</a></sup> to a <a href="/wiki/Jewish" id="w">Jewish</a> family in <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn%2C_New_York" id="w">Brooklyn, New York</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other sources place his birth in <a href="/wiki/Wolcott%2C_New_York" id="w">Wolcott, New York</a>,<sup id="_ref-birthplace_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-birthplace" title="">[5]</a></sup> but no official record of his birth has been published to date, and officials in Wolcott say they have no record of any Meister. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" id="w">The Times</a></i> wrote: “Lewis was born Albert Meister, probably in 1923, although he insisted that he was born in 1910. This, and Lewis’s many other questionable stories, means that much of the actor’s life is a broth of conjecture that his fans will no doubt squabble over for years to come.”</p>
<p>On his application for a <a href="/wiki/Social_Security_number_(United_States)" id="w">Social Security number</a>, completed sometime between 1936 and 1950, Lewis gave a date of birth of <a href="/wiki/30_April" id="w">30 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a>.<sup id="_ref-SS_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SS" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The date of birth must be verified by a birth certificate for the enrollee to receive age-related benefits.</p>
<p>As to why Lewis might have lied about his age, the most common theory is that in 1964 he might have been concerned about being a year younger than <a href="/wiki/Yvonne_De_Carlo" id="w">Yvonne De Carlo</a>, who was cast to play his daughter, Lily.</p>
<a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h1> Education </h1>
<p>He said he moved to <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn%2C_New_York" id="w">Brooklyn, New York</a> with his family as a child and attended Thomas Jefferson High School, from which he left in his junior year. He later attended Oswego State Teachers College (now <a href="/wiki/SUNY_Oswego" id="w">SUNY Oswego</a>). He also claimed he earned a <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy" id="w">Ph.D.</a> in <a href="/wiki/Child_psychology" id="w">child psychology</a> from <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" id="w">Columbia University</a> in 1941. The university, though, has no record of this.<sup id="_ref-shepperd_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shepperd" title="">[2]</a></sup> In other interviews he also claimed he joined the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Merchant_Marine" id="w">Merchant Marine</a> prior to <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> and spent time in Italy.</p>

In interviews he said he worked as a <a href="/wiki/Circus_(performing_art)" id="w">circus</a> performer and as a hot dog vendor at <a href="/wiki/Ebbets_Field" id="w">Ebbets Field</a>, the former ballpark for the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers" id="w">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>. In 1987 he opened an Italian restaurant called “Grampa&#39;s Bella Gente” at 252 Bleecker Street in <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Village" id="w">Greenwich Village</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>.</p>
<a id="Acting" name="Acting"></a><h2> Acting </h2>
<p>His acting career begins the well documented portion of his life. He worked in <a href="/wiki/Burlesque" id="w">burlesque</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vaudeville" id="w">vaudeville</a> theaters, then on <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" id="w">Broadway</a> in the dramas <i><a href="/wiki/The_Night_Circus" id="w">The Night Circus</a></i> (1958) and <i><a href="/wiki/One_More_River" id="w">One More River</a></i> (1960), and as the character Moe Shtarker in the musical comedy <i><a href="/wiki/Do_Re_Mi_(musical)" id="w">Do Re Mi</a></i> (1962). His earliest television work includes two episodes of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Phil_Silvers_Show" id="w">The Phil Silvers Show</a></i> in 1959, and four episodes of <i><a href="/wiki/Naked_City_(TV_series)" id="w">Naked City</a></i> from 1959 to 1963. His first well-known television role was as Officer Leo Schnauser on <i><a href="/wiki/Car_54%2C_Where_Are_You%3F" id="w">Car 54, Where Are You?</a></i> from 1961 to 1963, although he is best remembered as Grandpa on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Munsters" id="w">The Munsters</a></i>, which ran on American <a href="/wiki/Television" id="w">television</a> from 1964 to 1966 and for years later in re-runs. His first role in a movie was playing Machine Gun Manny in <i><a href="/wiki/Pretty_Boy_Floyd_(film)" id="w">Pretty Boy Floyd</a></i> (1960). He also played the character Turkey in <i><a href="/wiki/They_Shoot_Horses%2C_Don%26%2339%3Bt_They%3F" id="w">They Shoot Horses, Don&#39;t They?</a></i> (1969). His last role in a movie was Father Hanlon in <i>Night Terror</i> (2002).</p>
<p>He was also a recurring guest on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Howard_Stern_Show" id="w">The Howard Stern Show</a></i>. In 1987 during a rally against the <a href="/wiki/FCC" id="w">FCC</a>, Howard Stern held a live rally on the air, and when Al took the stage, he repeatedly yelled obscenities about the FCC until Howard was able to take the microphone away from him. </p>
<p>Al Lewis was featured in the Atari 7800 game Midnight Mutants <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>, an action-adventure title with a Halloween theme.  His appearance in the game mirrored his Grampa persona in the Munsters television series.</p>

 has claimed that he was member of the <a href="/wiki/Sacco_and_Vanzetti" id="w">Sacco and Vanzetti</a> Defense Committee in 1927, and that he worked in the 1930s to free the <a href="/wiki/Scottsboro_Boys" id="w">Scottsboro Boys</a>. However, both of these would be impossible if he had been born in 1923. </p>
<p>In a 1997 interview, Lewis also claimed that he was an organizer in the Food, Agricultural and Tobacco Workers Union in <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> in the 1930s. Once on his <a href="/wiki/WBAI-FM" id="w">WBAI-FM</a> radio program Lewis said “If anything I consider myself an <a href="/wiki/Anarchist" id="w">anarchist</a>.” </p>
<p>As an activist, he hosted a politically oriented radio program on WBAI, and ran as <a href="/wiki/Green_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Green Party</a> candidate for <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_New_York" id="w">Governor of New York</a> in 1998. In that race he sought to be listed on the ballot as “Grandpa Al Lewis”, arguing that he was most widely known by that name. His request was rejected by the Board of Elections, a decision upheld in court against his challenge. Despite this setback, he achieved one of his campaign objectives. His total of 52,533 votes exceeded the threshold of votes set by New York law (50,000), and hence guaranteed the <a href="/wiki/Green_Party_of_New_York" id="w">Green Party of New York</a> an automatic ballot line for the next four years. (See <a href="/wiki/Election_results%2C_New_York_governor" id="w">Election results, New York governor</a>) He said that, with “no [political] <a href="/wiki/Political_machine" id="w">machine</a> and no money” backing him, the likelihood of winning the governorship would be “like climbing Mount Everest barefooted”. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Al Lewis was married twice. He married Marge Domowitz in 1956. They had three sons, including one who was a high school football player,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> and divorced in 1977.

In 2003, he was hospitalized for an <a href="/wiki/Angioplasty" id="w">angioplasty</a>, and complications from the surgery led to an emergency bypass and the amputation of his right leg below the knee and all the toes on his left foot.
