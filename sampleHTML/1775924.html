The <b>recorded <a href="/wiki/Military_history" id="w">military history</a></b> of <b><a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico" id="w">Puerto Rico</a></b> encompasses the period from the 16th century, when <a href="/wiki/Spanish_people" id="w">Spanish</a> <a href="/wiki/Conquistador" id="w">conquistadores</a> battled native <a href="/wiki/Taino" id="w">Tainos</a>, to the present employment of Puerto Ricans in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces" id="w">United States Armed Forces</a> in the military campaigns in <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" id="w">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Iraq" id="w">Iraq</a>.</p>
<p>Puerto Rico was part of the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Empire" id="w">Spanish Empire</a> for four centuries, when the Puerto Ricans defended themselves against invasions from the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British</a>, <a href="/wiki/French_colonization_of_the_Americas" id="w">French</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dutch_colonization_of_the_Americas" id="w">Dutch</a>.  During the mid-19th century, the quest for <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" id="w">Latin American</a> independence from <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a> spread to Puerto Rico, culminating in the failed revolution known as <i><a href="/wiki/Grito_de_Lares" id="w">El Grito de Lares</a></i>.  The island was invaded by the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Spanish-American_War" id="w">Spanish-American War</a>; the war ended when Spain officially ceded the island under the <a href="/wiki/1898_Treaty_of_Paris" id="w">1898 Treaty of Paris</a>.  Puerto Rico became a <a href="/wiki/United_States_territory" id="w">United States territory</a> and a military regiment known as the Porto Rico Regiment was established on the island.</p>
<p>As citizens of the United States, Puerto Ricans have participated in every major United States military engagement from <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, with Puerto Rico&#39;s <a href="/wiki/65th_Infantry" id="w">65th Infantry Regiment</a> distinguishing themselves in combat during the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" id="w">Korean War</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Christopher_Columbus" id="w">Christopher Columbus</a> discovered the island of Puerto Rico on <a href="/wiki/November_19" id="w">November 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1493" id="w">1493</a> during his second voyage to the New World.  The island was inhabited by the <a href="/wiki/Arawak" id="w">Arawak</a> group of <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" id="w">indigenous peoples</a> known as Tainos, who called the island &#34;Borikén&#34; or &#34;Borinquen&#34;. Columbus named the island <i><a href="/wiki/San_Juan_Bautista" id="w">San Juan Bautista</a></i> in honor of <a href="/wiki/John_the_Baptist" id="w">Saint John the Baptist</a>. The main port was named <i>Puerto Rico (Rich Port)</i> (eventually the island was renamed Puerto Rico and the port which was to evolve into the capital of the island was renamed San Juan).

When Ponce de León arrived in Puerto Rico, he was well received by the <i>Cacique</i> (<a href="/wiki/Tribal_chief" id="w">Tribal chief</a>) <a href="/wiki/Ag%C3%BCeyban%C3%A1" id="w">Agüeybaná</a> (The Great Sun), chieftain of the island Taino tribes. Besides the conquistadors, some of the first colonists were farmers and miners in search of <a href="/wiki/Gold_mining" id="w">gold</a>. In 1508, Ponce de León became the first appointed governor of Puerto Rico, founding the first settlement of <a href="/wiki/Caparra" id="w">Caparra</a> between the modern-day cities of <a href="/wiki/Bayam%C3%B3n%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Bayamón</a> and San Juan. After being named Governor, de León and the conquistadors forced the Tainos to work in the mines and to build fortifications; many Tainos died as a result of cruel treatment during their labor. In 1510, upon Agüeybaná&#39;s death, his brother Agüeybaná II (The Brave) and a group of Tainos led <a href="/wiki/Diego_Salcedo_(soldier)" id="w">Diego Salcedo</a>, a Spaniard, to a river and drowned him, proving to his people that the white men were not gods. Upon realizing this, Agüeybaná II led the first island rebellion against the better armed Spanish forces. The colonists formed a citizens&#39; <a href="/wiki/Militia" id="w">militia</a> to defend themselves against the attacks. Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

Puerto Rico was considered the &#34;Key to the Antilles&#34; by the Spanish because of its location as a way station and port for Spanish vessels. In 1540, with revenue from <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexican</a> mines, the Spanish settlers began the construction of <a href="/wiki/Fort_San_Felipe_del_Morro" id="w">Fort San Felipe del Morro</a> (&#34;the promontory&#34;) in San Juan. With the completion of the initial phase of the construction in 1589 <i>El Morro</i> became the island&#39;s main military fortification, guarded by professional soldiers. The rest of Puerto Rico had to rely on only a handful of soldiers and the local volunteer militia to defend the island against militant and pirate attacks. </p>

<p>Native-born Puerto Rican (<i>criollos</i>) had petitioned the Spanish Crown to serve in the regular Spanish army, resulting in the 1741 organization of the Regimiento Fijo de Puerto Rico. The Fijo served in the defense of Puerto Rico and other Spanish overseas possessions, performing in battles in Santo Domingo, other islands in the Caribbean, and South America, most notably in <a href="/wiki/Venezuela" id="w">Venezuela</a>. However, Puerto Rican complaints that the Fijo was being used to suppress the revolution in Venezuela caused the Crown to bring the Fijo home and in 1815 it was mustered out of service.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

During the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" id="w">American Revolutionary War</a>, Spain lent the rebelling colonists the use of its ports in Puerto Rico, through which flowed financial aid and arms for their cause. An incident occurred in the coast of Mayagüez, in 1777, between two <a href="/wiki/Continental_Navy" id="w">Continental Navy</a> ships, the <i>Eudawook</i> and the <i>Henry</i>, and a Royal Navy warship, the <a href="/wiki/HMS_Glasgow" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Glasgow&#39;&#39;</a>. Both American ships were chased by the larger and more powerful <i>Glasgow</i>. The American ships were close to the coast of Mayagüez; members of the Puerto Rican militia of that town, realizing that something was wrong, signaled for the ships to dock at the town&#39;s bay. After the ships docked, the crews of both ships got off and some Mayagüezanos boarded and raised the Spanish flag on both ships. The commander of the <i>Glasgow</i> became aware of the situation and asked the island&#39;s governor, Jose Dufresne to turn over the ships.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_17" id="w">February 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1797" id="w">1797</a>, the appointed governor of Puerto Rico, <a href="/wiki/Brigadier_general" id="w">brigadier general</a> Ramón de Castro, received the news that England had invaded the island of Trinidad.

On <a href="/wiki/April_17" id="w">April 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1797" id="w">1797</a>, British ships under the command of Sir <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Abercromby" id="w">Ralph Abercromby</a> approached the coastal town of <a href="/wiki/Lo%C3%ADza%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Loíza</a>, to the east of San Juan. On <a href="/wiki/April_18" id="w">April 18</a>, British soldiers and German mercenaries (&#34;<a href="/wiki/Hessian" id="w">Hessians</a>&#34;) landed on Loíza&#39;s beach. Under the command of de Castro, British ships were attacked with artillery and mortar fire from both El Morro and the San Gerónimo fortresses. The British twice tried to take the Martín Peña Bridge, a key passage to the San Juan islet, but after fiercely fighting the Spanish forces and local militia, were defeated in both attempts. The invasion failed because a total of 16,000 Puerto Rican volunteers and Spanish troops fought back and defended the island. The British also attacked <a href="/wiki/Aguadilla%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Aguadilla</a> and Punta Salinas, but they were defeated, and the British troops that had landed on the island were taken prisoner. The British retreated on <a href="/wiki/April_30" id="w">April 30</a> to their ships and on <a href="/wiki/May_2" id="w">May 2</a> set sail northward. Because of the defeat given to the British forces, governor Ramon de Castro petitioned Spanish King <a href="/wiki/Charles_IV_of_Spain" id="w">Charles IV</a> for recognition for the victors; he was promoted to Field Marshal and several others were promoted and given pay raises.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Miller_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Miller" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>

While Spain and Britain were in a power struggle in the New World, Puerto Rican <a href="/wiki/Privateer" id="w">privateering</a> of British ships was encouraged by the Spanish Crown. Captains <a href="/wiki/Miguel_Henriquez" id="w">Miguel Henriquez</a> and <a href="/wiki/Roberto_Cofresi" id="w">Roberto Cofresi</a> were two of the most famous pirates. In the latter half of the 17th century, Henriquez, a <a href="/wiki/Shoemaking" id="w">shoemaker</a> by occupation, decided to try his luck as a pirate. He showed great valor in intercepting English merchant ships and other ships dedicated to <a href="/wiki/List_of_items_for_which_possession_is_restricted" id="w">contraband</a> that were infesting the seas of Puerto Rico and the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> in general. Miguel Henriquez organized an expeditionary force which fought and defeated the British in the island of Vieques. Henriquez was received as a national hero when he returned the island of Vieques to the Spanish Empire and to the governorship of Puerto Rico. In recognition of his service, the Spanish Crown awarded Henriquez the <i>Medalla de Oro de la Real Efigie</i> (The Gold Medal of the Royal Image), named him &#34;Captain of the Seas and Land&#34;, and gave him a <a href="/wiki/Letter_of_marque_and_reprisal" id="w">letter of marque and reprisal</a> thus granting him the privileges of privateer.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the case of Captain Roberto Cofresi, the Spanish government received many complaints from the nations whose ships he attacked. Cofresi and his men attacked eight ships, amongst them an American ship. The Spanish government, which routinely encouraged piracy against other nations, was pressured and felt obliged to pursue and capture the famous pirate. In 1824, Captain John Slout of the U.S. Naval Forces and his schooner &#34;Grampus&#34; engaged Cofresi in a fierce battle. The pirate Cofresi was captured, along with eleven of his crew members, and turned over to the Spanish Government. He was imprisoned in <a href="/wiki/El_Morro" id="w">El Castillo del Morro</a> in San Juan. Cofresi was judged by a Spanish Council of War, found guilty, and executed by firing squad on <a href="/wiki/March_29" id="w">March 29</a> <a href="/wiki/1825" id="w">1825</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a> was a world military and commercial power by 1625, competing in the Caribbean with the British.

He also had former governor Juan de Vargas organize an armed resistance in the interior of the island. On <a href="/wiki/September_25" id="w">September 25</a> Enrico attacked San Juan, besieging El Morro Castle and <a href="/wiki/La_Fortaleza" id="w">La Fortaleza</a> (the Governor&#39;s Mansion).

<p>Many Spanish colonies had gained their independence by the mid-1850s. In Puerto Rico, there were two groups: the loyalists, who were loyal to Spain, and the <i>independentistas</i>, who advocated independence. In 1866, Dr. <a href="/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Emeterio_Betances" id="w">Ramón Emeterio Betances</a>, <a href="/wiki/Segundo_Ruiz_Belvis" id="w">Segundo Ruiz Belvis</a>, and other independence advocates met in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> where they formed the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico. An outcome of this venture was a plan to send an armed expedition from the <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" id="w">Dominican Republic</a> to invade the island. Several revolutionary cells were formed in the western towns and cities of Puerto Rico. Two of the most important cells were at <a href="/wiki/Mayag%C3%BCez%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Mayagüez</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/Mathias_Brugman" id="w">Mathias Brugman</a> and code named &#34;Capa Prieto&#34; and at Lares, code-named &#34;Centro Bravo&#34; and headed by <a href="/wiki/Manuel_Rojas" id="w">Manuel Rojas</a>. &#34;Centro Bravo&#34; was the main center of operations and was located in the Rojas plantation of El Triunfo. Manuel Rojas was named &#34;Commander of the Liberation Army&#34; by Betances. <a href="/wiki/Mariana_Bracetti" id="w">Mariana Bracetti</a> (sister-in-law of Manuel) was named &#34;Leader of the Lares Revolutionary Council.&#34; Upon the request of Betances, Bracetti knitted the revolutionary <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Lares" id="w">Flag of Lares</a> (<i>Bandera de Lares</i>).<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

The Spanish authorities discovered the plot and were able to confiscate Betances&#39;s armed ship before it arrived in Puerto Rico. The Mayor of the town of <a href="/wiki/Camuy%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Camuy</a>, Manuel Gonzalez (leader of that town&#39;s revolutionary cell), was arrested and charged with treason. He learned that the Spanish Army was aware of the independence plot, and escaped to warn Manuel Rojas. Alerted, the revolutionists decided to start the revolution as soon as possible, and set the date for <a href="/wiki/September_28" id="w">September 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1868" id="w">1868</a>. Mathias Brugman and his men joined with Manuel Rojas&#39;s men and with about 800 men and women, marched on and took the town of Lares. This was to be known as &#34;el <a href="/wiki/Grito_de_Lares_(The_Cry_of_Lares)" id="w">Grito de Lares</a>.&#34;  The revolutionists entered the town&#39;s church and placed Mariana Bracetti&#39;s revolutionary flag on the High Altar as a sign that the revolution had begun. They declared Puerto Rico to be the &#34;Republic of Puerto Rico&#34; and named <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Ramirez_Medina" id="w">Francisco Ramirez</a> its President. Manuel and his poorly armed followers proceeded to march on to the town of <a href="/wiki/San_Sebasti%C3%A1n%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">San Sebastián</a>, armed only with clubs and machetes. The Spanish Army had been forewarned, and awaited with superior fire power. The revolutionists were met with deadly fire. The revolt failed, many revolutionists were killed, and at least 475, including Manuel Rojas and Mariana Bracetti, were imprisoned in the jail of <a href="/wiki/Arecibo" id="w">Arecibo</a> and sentenced to death.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Others fled and went into hiding. Mathias Brugman was hiding in a local farm where he was betrayed by a farmer named Francisco Quiñones; he was captured and executed on the spot. In 1869, fearing another revolt, the Spanish Crown disbanded the Puerto Rican Militia, which had been composed almost entirely of native-born Puerto Ricans, and also the Compañia de Artilleros Morenos de Cangrejos, a separate company of black Puerto Ricans. They then organized the Volunteer Institute, composed entirely of Spaniards and their sons.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1897, before the onset of fighting in Puerto Rico, <a href="/wiki/Juan_Alonso_Zayas" id="w">Juan Alonso Zayas</a>, born in San Juan, was a Second Lieutenant in the Spanish Army when he received orders to head for the Philippines to take command of the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion stationed in <a href="/wiki/Baler%2C_Aurora" id="w">Baler</a>. He arrived in <a href="/wiki/Manila" id="w">Manila</a>, the capital, in May 1897. There he took a vessel and headed for Baler, on the island of <a href="/wiki/Luzon" id="w">Luzon</a>. The distance between Manila and Baler is 62 miles (100 km); if traveled through the jungles and badly-built roads, the actual distance was 144 miles (230 km). At that time a system of communication between Manila and Baler was almost non-existent. The only way Baler received news from Manila was by way of vessels. The Spanish colonial government was under constant attack from local Filipino groups who wanted independence. Zayas&#39;s mission was to fortify Baler against any possible attack. Among his plans for the defense of Baler was to convert the local church of San Luis de Tolosa into a fort.<sup id="_ref-Alonso_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alonso" title="">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The independence advocates, under the leadership of Colonel Calixto Vilacorte, were called &#34;<a href="/wiki/Insurgency" id="w">insurgents</a>&#34; (<i>Tagalos</i>) by the Spanish crown. On <a href="/wiki/June_28" id="w">June 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1898" id="w">1898</a>, they demanded the surrender of the Spanish army. The Spanish governor of the region, Enrique de las Morena y Fossi, refused; the Filipinos immediately attacked Baler in a battle that was to last for seven months. Despite being outnumbered and suffering hunger and disease, the battalion did not capitulate. In the meantime, Zayas and the rest of the battalion were totally unaware of the Spanish-American War that was going on. On August 1898, the hostilities between the United States and Spain came to an end. The Philippines became a U.S. possession under the accordance of the Treaty of Paris. In May 1899, the Battalion at Baler found out about the Spanish-American War and its aftermath. They had been unaware that they had been fighting for a possession which was no longer theirs to fight for. On <a href="/wiki/June_2" id="w">June 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1899" id="w">1899the</a> Battalion&#39;s commander, Lieutenant Martín Cerezo surrendered to the Tagalos only after some conditions were met.

<ul>
<li>1. That the Spaniards not be treated as prisoners of war and </li>
<li>2. that they would not be harmed in their guest of reaching a Spanish ship which would take them back to Spain.</li></ul>
<p>The 32 survivors of Zayas Battalion were sent to Manila, where they boarded a ship for Spain.

<p>In 1938, when Germany attacked Great Britain, the United States feared that if Germany controlled Great Britain, Mexico and the U.S. would be next. In 1940, President <a href="/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt" id="w">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> ordered the construction of a naval base in the Atlantic similar to <a href="/wiki/Pearl_Harbor" id="w">Pearl Harbor</a> in Hawaii.

The naval base, which was named U.S. Naval Station Roosevelt Roads’  became the largest naval installation in the world in land mass and was meant to be the Pearl Harbor of the Atlantic.

<p>World War II was also the first conflict in which women, other than nurses, were allowed to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. However, when the United States entered World War II, Puerto Rican nurses volunteered for service but were not accepted into the Army or Navy Nurse Corps. As a result, many of the island&#39;s women work force migrated to the mainland U.S. to work in the factories which produced military equipment. In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps decided to actively recruit Puerto Rican nurses so that Army hospitals would not have to deal with the language barriers.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_26" id="w">August 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1950" id="w">1950</a>, the 65th Infantry departed from Puerto Rico and arrived in Pusan, Korea on <a href="/wiki/September_23" id="w">September 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1950" id="w">1950</a>. It was during the long sea voyage that the 65th Infantry was nicknamed the &#34;Borinqueneers&#34;. The name is a combination of the words &#34;Borinquen&#34; (the Taíno name for Puerto Rico) and &#34;Buccaneers&#34;. The men of the 65th were the first infantrymen to meet the enemy on the battle fields of Korea. Among the hardships suffered by the Puerto Ricans was the lack of warm clothing during the cold, harsh winters. The enemy made many attempts to encircle the Regiment, but each time they failed because of the many casualties inflicted by the 65th. On December 1950, the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Marine_Corps" id="w">U.S. Marines</a> found themselves at the Chosin Reservoir area. In June 1951, The 65th was part of a task force which enabled the Marines to withdraw from the Hauack-on Reservoir. When the Marines were encircled by the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Communist" id="w">Chinese Communist</a> troops close to the <a href="/wiki/Manchuria" id="w">Manchurian</a> border, the 65th rushed to their defense. As a consequence, the Marines were able to return safely to their ships.<sup id="_ref-Valerosos_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Valerosos" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Among the battles and operations in which the 65th participated was the Operation &#34;Killer&#34; of January 1951, becoming the first Regiment to cross the <a href="/wiki/Han_River_(Korea)" id="w">Han River</a>. On April 1951, the Regiment participated in the Uijonber Corridor drives and on June 1951, the 65th was the third Regiment to cross the Han Ton River. The 65th was the Regiment that took and held Cherwon and they were also instrumental in breaking the &#34;Iron Triangle&#34; of Hill 717 on July 1951. On November 1951, the Regiment fought off an attack by two Regimental size enemy units, with success. Colonel <a href="/wiki/Juan_Cesar_Cordero_Davila" id="w">Juan Cesar Cordero Davila</a> was named commander of 65th Infantry on <a href="/wiki/February_8" id="w">February 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1952" id="w">1952</a>, thus becoming one of the highest ranking ethnic officers in the Army. On <a href="/wiki/July_3" id="w">July 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/1952" id="w">1952</a>, the Regiment defended the MLR for 47 days and saw action at Cognac, King and Queen with successful attacks on Chinese positions. On October the Regiment also saw action in the Cherwon Sector and on Iron Horse, Hill 391, whose lower part was called &#34;Jackson Heights&#34;. On September 1952, the 65th Infantry was holding on to a hill known as &#34;Outpost Kelly&#34;. Chinese Communist forces that had joined the North Koreans overran the hill in what became known as the Battle for Outpost Kelly. Twice the 65th Regiment was overwhelmed by Chinese artillery and driven off.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<p>In June 1953, the 2nd <a href="/wiki/Battalion" id="w">Battalion</a> conducted a series of successful raids on Hill 412 and in November, the Regiment successfully counterattacked enemy units in the Numsong Valley and held their positions until the truce signing between all parts involved.  </p>
<a id="Mass_court-martial_and_post-war_recognitions" name="Mass_court-martial_and_post-war_recognitions"></a><h4>Mass court-martial and post-war recognitions</h4>

<p>Col. Cordero Davila was relieved of his command by Col. Chester B. DeGavre, a West Point graduate and a &#34;continental&#34; officer from the mainland United States and the officer staff of the 65th was replaced with non-Hispanic officers. DeGavre ordered that the unit stop calling itself the Borinqueneers, cut their special rations of rice and beans, ordered the men to shave off their mustaches and had one of them wear signs that read &#34;I am a coward&#34;. It is believed that as a result of this humiliation, combat exhaustion, and the language barrier where factors that influenced some of the men of Company L of the 65th in their refusal to continue to fight.</p>
<p>In December 1954, 162 Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested, 95 were court martialed, and 91 were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass <a href="/wiki/Court_martial" id="w">court martial</a> of the Korean War. The <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Army" id="w">Secretary of the Army</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_Stevens" id="w">Robert Stevens</a> moved quickly to remit the sentences and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved. Though the men who were court martialed were pardoned, there is currently a campaign for a formal exoneration.<sup id="_ref-Brown_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brown" title="">[69]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>An Army report released in 2001 blamed the breakdown of the 65th on the following factors: a shortage of officers and noncommissioned officers, a rotation policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactics that led to high casualties, an ammunition shortage, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking officers and Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. The report also found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 65th Infantry was credited with battle participation in nine campaigns.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> Among the distinctions awarded to the members of the 65th were 10 <a href="/wiki/Distinguished_Service_Cross_(United_States)" id="w">Distinguished Service Cross</a>, 256 <a href="/wiki/Silver_Star_Medal" id="w">Silver Star Medals</a> and 595 <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Star_Medal" id="w">Bronze Star Medals</a>.

More then half of these were from the 65th Infantry (This is without including non-Puerto Ricans). The 65th Infantry returned to Puerto Rico and was deactivated in 1956. However, Brig. General Juan Cordero, Puerto Rico&#39;s Adjutant General, persuaded the Department of the Army to transfer the 65th Infantry from the regular Army to the Puerto Rican National Guard. This was the only unit ever transferred from active component Army to the Army Guard.<sup id="_ref-Brown_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brown" title="">[69]</a></sup></p>
