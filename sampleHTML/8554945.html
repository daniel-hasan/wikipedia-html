After Japan&#39;s victory in the <a href="/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War" id="w">Russo-Japanese War</a>, and subsequent occupation, and then annexation of Korea, the need was felt for a dedicated garrison force, raised from people with local knowledge. The 20th Division was stationed in central Korea, in what is now <a href="/wiki/Yongsan-gu" id="w">Yongsan-gu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Seoul" id="w">Seoul</a> and was responsible for the security of southern Korea. Although officially raised in 1915, due to budgetary issues, the 20th Division existed only on paper until 1918.</p>

However, in July 1937, without having seen any combat, it was withdrawn back to <a href="/wiki/Keijo" id="w">Keijo</a>.</p>
<p>In September, 1942, its 77th Infantry Regiment was elevated into the <a href="/wiki/30th_Infantry_Division_(Imperial_Japanese_Army)" id="w">30th Division</a>.
