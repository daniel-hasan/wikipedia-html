&#34;<b>The Bus Uncle</b>&#34; is a <a href="/wiki/Cantonese_(linguistics)" id="w">Cantonese</a> <a href="/wiki/Video_clip" id="w">video clip</a> of a quarrel between two men aboard a <a href="/wiki/Buses_in_Hong_Kong" id="w">bus</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a> on <a href="/wiki/April_27" id="w">April 27</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>.

<p>In June 2006, TVB television made a parody of the Bus Uncle video in promoting its coverage of the <a href="/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup" id="w">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>, featuring its sports commentator Lam Sheung Yee (林尚義), whose voice resembles Chan&#39;s, on a bus playing the role of the Bus Uncle. In the advertisement, a passenger sitting behind Lam Sheung Yee (played by Lam Man Chung) questions whether Lam Sheung Yee feels pressured for his responsibilities in the upcoming World Cup, which would be his last TV appearance before retirement. Turning around, Lam replies that there is no pressure and emphasises the issue (i.e. the viewers&#39; demand for World Cup coverage) has been resolved.

<p>Although many found the video humorous and entertaining, others warned that it hinted at a more alarming and sinister prognosis of life in stress-filled Hong Kong, particularly inside buses, nicknamed &#34;flying cars of death&#34;<sup id="_ref-WSJ_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WSJ" title="">[6]</a></sup> and other overcrowded areas.

<p><a href="/wiki/To_Kit" id="w">To Kit</a>, a well-known columnist and broadcaster, commented about the incident on Commercial Radio.

In addition, he noted that the incident implied that harmony in the neighbourhood was somehow upset.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lee Sing, director of the Hong Kong Mood Disorders Centre at the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_University_of_Hong_Kong" id="w">Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>, warned that Hong Kong&#39;s high-stress working environments are spawning a city-full of &#34;Bus Uncles.&#34; Lee estimated that one of every 50 grumpy Hong Kongers suffers from <a href="/wiki/Intermittent_explosive_disorder" id="w">intermittent explosive disorder</a>,<sup id="_ref-CNNrp_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNNrp" title="">[2]</a></sup> turning one into a &#34;ticking time bomb&#34; of rage and violence.<sup id="_ref-explode_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-explode" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Journalism professor and internet expert Anthony Fung Ying-him also attributed the popularity of the low-resolution video of a &#34;trivial event&#34; to the emotional climate of the city.<sup id="_ref-explode_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-explode" title="">[29]</a></sup> While other viral videos are favoured by specific demographics, this one spread widely due to its universal<sup id="_ref-alongfor_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-alongfor" title="">[30]</a></sup> expression of &#34;the true feelings of ordinary people.&#34;<sup id="_ref-CNNrp_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNNrp" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/Ah_Nong" id="w">Ah Nong</a> (阿濃), a popular literary figure and artist in Hong Kong, believed that the incident highlighted the apathy of the common Hong Kong people. He emphasised that during the heated exchange between Chan and Ho, not a single bystander came to Ho&#39;s aid. He recalled an incident a few years back where he confronted a man smoking on the lower deck of a bus and was scolded for the rest of the journey. He said it was useless to complain to the bus driver who would not bother to waste his time, let alone the other passengers. Ah Nong argued that in such a society, a person can be accused of wrongdoing despite good intentions.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Apple Tse Ho Yi, minister of the Hong Kong Christian Service, carried out a survey of 506 students over the age of 12 about the Bus Uncle incident and civic awareness in general. Of the respondents who claim they regularly encountered people speaking loudly on the phone on buses, only 47 percent said they would intervene by talking to the phone user or alerting the driver. Reasons for inaction include fear, apathy and inability to solve the problem. On civic awareness, the majority of the respondents did not consider chatting loudly on the phone to be wrong. Tse concluded that the current generation of Hong Kong young people have poor civic awareness, and it is natural that disputes often occur due to inconsideration.<sup id="_ref-survey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-survey" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ng Fung Sheung, a social science lecturer of the <a href="/wiki/City_University_of_Hong_Kong" id="w">City University of Hong Kong</a>, explained that Hong Kong people tend to chat loudly in public places. She attributed this phenomenon to the television screens found in many vehicles and trains, which broadcast programmes at high volumes. She suggested that the government should provide better civic education for the public to make them more considerate of others. When it comes to schools which banned the usage of catch phrases like &#34;I&#39;m stressed!&#34; Ng stated that teachers must be able to distinguish whether the students really face pressure or are simply following the trend, and provide guidance if necessary.<sup id="_ref-Problem_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Problem" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
