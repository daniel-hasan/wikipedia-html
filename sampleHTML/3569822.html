<b><i>A Beautiful Mind</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/2001_in_film" id="w">2001</a> <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Biographical_film" id="w">biographical film</a> about <a href="/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash" id="w">John Forbes Nash</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Laureate" id="w">Nobel Laureate</a> (<a href="/wiki/Bank_of_Sweden_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences_in_Memory_of_Alfred_Nobel" id="w">Economics</a>) <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" id="w">mathematician</a>. The film was directed by <a href="/wiki/Ron_Howard" id="w">Ron Howard</a> and written by <a href="/wiki/Akiva_Goldsman" id="w">Akiva Goldsman</a>. It was inspired by a bestselling, <a href="/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize" id="w">Pulitzer Prize</a>-nominated 1998 <a href="/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(book)" id="w">book of the same name</a> by <a href="/wiki/Sylvia_Nasar" id="w">Sylvia Nasar</a>. The film stars <a href="/wiki/Russell_Crowe" id="w">Russell Crowe</a>, along with <a href="/wiki/Jennifer_Connelly" id="w">Jennifer Connelly</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ed_Harris" id="w">Ed Harris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paul_Bettany" id="w">Paul Bettany</a>.</p>
<p>The story begins in the early years of Nash&#39;s life at <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton University</a> as he develops his &#34;original idea&#34; that will revolutionize the world of mathematics. Later, Nash develops <a href="/wiki/Schizophrenia" id="w">schizophrenia</a> and endures paranoid and delusional episodes while painfully watching the loss and burden his condition brings on his wife and friends.</p>
<p>The film opened in US cinemas on <a href="/wiki/December_21" id="w">December 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>. It was well received by critics, and went on to win four <a href="/wiki/Academy_Awards" id="w">Academy Awards</a>, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress. It was also nominated for Best Leading Actor, Best Editing, Best Makeup, and Best Score. The film has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of some aspects of Nash&#39;s life.</p>
<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h1>Production</h1>
<p>Producer Brian Grazer first read an excerpt of <a href="/wiki/Sylvia_Nasar" id="w">Sylvia Nasar</a>&#39;s book <i><a href="/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(book)" id="w">A Beautiful Mind</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/Vanity_Fair" id="w">Vanity Fair</a> magazine. Grazer immediately purchased the rights to the film.<sup id="_ref-Partners_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Partners" title="">[1]</a></sup> He eventually brought the project to Ron Howard, who had scheduling conflicts and was forced to pass. Grazer later said that many <a href="/wiki/A-list" id="w">A-list</a> directors were calling with their point of view on the project. He eventually focused on a particular director, who coincidentally was only available at the same time Howard was available. Grazer was forced to make a decision and chose Howard.<sup id="_ref-Partners_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Partners" title="">[1]</a></sup>

<div class="thumbcaption">From left to right: Director Ron Howard, actor Russell Crowe, producer Brian Grazer, and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman.</div></div>

Grazer then met with a number of screenwriters, mostly consisting of &#34;serious dramatists&#34;, but he chose <a href="/wiki/Akiva_Goldsman" id="w">Akiva Goldsman</a> instead, because of his strong passion and desire for the project. Goldsman&#39;s creative take on the project was to not allow the viewers to understand that they are viewing an alternate reality until a specific point in the film. This was done to rob the viewers of their feelings in the same way that Nash himself was. Howard agreed to direct the film based only on the first draft. He then requested that Goldsman accentuate the love story aspect.<sup id="_ref-Screenplay_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Screenplay" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Dave Bayer, a Barnard College Professor of Mathematics, was consulted on the mathematical equations that appear in the film. Bayer later stated that he approached his consulting role as an actor when preparing equations, such as when Nash is forced to teach a Calculus class, and arbitrarily places a complicated problem on the blackboard. Bayer focused on a character who did not want to teach ordinary details and was more concerned with what was interesting. Bayer received a cameo role in the film as a professor that lays his pen down for Nash in the pen ceremony near the end of the film.<sup id="_ref-Swarthmore_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Swarthmore" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Greg_Cannom" id="w">Greg Cannom</a> was chosen to create the makeup effects for <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>, specifically the age progression of the characters. Russell Crowe had previously worked with Cannom on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Insider_(film)" id="w">The Insider</a></i>. Howard had also worked with Cannom on <i><a href="/wiki/Cocoon_(film)" id="w">Cocoon</a></i>. Each character&#39;s stages of makeup were broken down by the number of years that would pass between levels. Cannom stressed subtlety between the stages, but worked toward the ultimate stage of &#34;Older Nash&#34;. It was originally decided that the makeup department would merely age Russell Crowe throughout the film. However, at Crowe&#39;s request, the makeup purposefully pulled Crowe&#39;s look towards the facial features of the real John Nash. Cannom developed a new silicone-type makeup that could simulate real skin and be utilized for overlapping applications, shortening the application time from eight hours to four hours. Crowe was also fitted with a number of dentures to give him a slight <a href="/wiki/Malocclusion" id="w">overbite</a> throughout the film.<sup id="_ref-Makeup_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Makeup" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Howard and Grazer chose frequent collaborator <a href="/wiki/James_Horner" id="w">James Horner</a> to score the film because of familiarity and his ability to communicate. Howard said, regarding Horner &#34;It&#39;s like having a conversation with a writer or an actor or another director.&#34; A running discussion between the director and the composer was the concept of high level mathematics being less about numbers and solutions, and more akin to a <a href="/wiki/Kaleidoscope" id="w">kaleidoscope</a>, in that the ideas evolve and change. After the first screening of the film, Horner told Howard &#34;I see changes occurring like fast moving weather systems.&#34; He chose it as another theme to connect to Nash&#39;s ever changing character. Horner chose pop singer <a href="/wiki/Charlotte_Church" id="w">Charlotte Church</a> to sing the soprano vocals after deciding that he needed a balance between a child and adult singing voice. He wanted a &#34;purity, clarity and brightness of an instrument&#34; but also a <a href="/wiki/Vibrato" id="w">vibrato</a> to maintain the humanity of the voice.<sup id="_ref-Music_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Music" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The film was shot 90% chronologically.<sup id="_ref-DVDcom_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DVDcom" title="">[6]</a></sup> Three separate trips were made to the <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton University</a> campus. During filming, Howard decided that Nash&#39;s delusions should always first be introduced audibly and then visually. This not only provides a visual clue, but establishes the delusions from Nash&#39;s point of view. The real John Nash&#39;s delusions were also only auditory. A technique was also developed to visualize Nash&#39;s epiphanies. After speaking to a number of mathematicians who described it as &#34;the smoke clearing&#34;, &#34;flashes of light&#34; and &#34;everything coming together&#34;, the filmmakers decided upon a flash of light appearing over an object or person to signify Nash&#39;s creativity at work.<sup id="_ref-DVDcom_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DVDcom" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h1>Plot</h1>
<p>The film opens with John Nash arriving as a new graduate student at <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton University</a>. He is a recipient of the prestigious <a href="/wiki/Carnegie_Prize" id="w">Carnegie Prize</a> for <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" id="w">mathematics</a>. He meets his <a href="/wiki/Roommate" id="w">roommate</a> Charles, a literature student, who soon becomes his best friend. He also meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students, Martin Hansen, Sol, and Bender, with whom he strikes up an awkward friendship. Nash admits to Charles that he is better with numbers than people, and that he strives for a truly original idea for his thesis paper. He is largely unsuccessful with the women at the local bar. However, the experience is what ultimately inspires his fruitful work in the concept of <a href="/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" id="w">governing dynamics</a>, a theory in <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_economics" id="w">mathematical economics</a>. After the conclusion of Nash&#39;s studies as a student at Princeton, he accepts a prestigious appointment at the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" id="w">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT), along with his friends Sol and Bender.

<div class="thumbcaption">Russell Crowe as John Nash.</div></div>
 
Five years later while teaching a class on <a href="/wiki/Calculus" id="w">Calculus</a>, he meets Alicia, a student with whom he falls in love and eventually marries. While at Princeton, Nash runs into his former roommate Charles and meets Charles&#39; young niece Marcee. He also encounters a mysterious <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" id="w">Department of Defense</a> agent, William Parcher. Nash is invited to a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" id="w">United States Department of Defense</a> facility in <a href="/wiki/The_Pentagon" id="w">The Pentagon</a> to <a href="/wiki/Cryptanalysis" id="w">crack</a> a complex <a href="/wiki/Encryption" id="w">encryption</a> of an enemy telecommunication. Nash is able to decipher the code mentally. Parcher observes Nash&#39;s performance from above, while partially concealed behind a screen. Parcher later encourages Nash to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers, ostensibly to thwart a <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet</a> plot. After being chased by the Russians and an exchange of gunfire, Nash becomes increasingly <a href="/wiki/Paranoia" id="w">paranoid</a> and begins to behave erratically.</p>
<p>After observing this erratic behavior, Alicia informs a psychiatric hospital. Later, while giving a lecture, Nash realizes that he is being watched by a hostile group of people. Although he attempts to flee, he is forcibly sedated and sent to a <a href="/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital" id="w">psychiatric facility</a>. Nash&#39;s internment seemingly confirms his belief that the Soviets were trying to extract information from him, and that being taken by the officials of a psychiatric facility was a kidnapping by Soviet agents. Alicia, desperate to help her husband, visits a drop-box and retrieves the never-opened &#34;top secret&#34; documents that Nash had delivered there. When confronted with this evidence, Nash is finally convinced that he has been <a href="/wiki/Hallucination" id="w">hallucinating</a>. The Department of Defense agent William Parcher and Nash&#39;s secret assignment to decode Soviet messages was in fact all a <a href="/wiki/Delusion" id="w">delusion</a>. Even more surprisingly, Nash&#39;s friend Charles and his niece Marcee are also only products of Nash&#39;s mind.</p>
<p>After a painful series of <a href="/wiki/Insulin_shock_therapy" id="w">insulin shock therapy</a> sessions, Nash is released on the condition that he agrees to take <a href="/wiki/Antipsychotic" id="w">antipsychotic</a> medication. However, the drugs create <a href="/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction" id="w">negative side-effects</a> that affect his relationship with his wife and, most dramatically, his intellect. Frustrated, Nash secretly stops taking his medication, triggering a relapse of his psychosis. While bathing his infant son, Nash becomes distracted and wanders off. Alicia barely manages to save their child from drowning. When she confronts Nash, he claims that his friend Charles was watching their son. Alicia runs to the phone to call the psychiatric hospital for emergency assistance. Charles, Marcee, and Parcher all appear to John and urge him to kill his wife rather than allow her to lock him up again. After Alicia flees the house in terror, Nash steps in front of her car to prevent her from leaving.  After a moment, Nash states &#34;She never gets old&#34; as he observes that Marcee is the same age that she was when he first met her several years before. Only then does he accept that all three of these people are, in fact, part of his psychosis.</p>
<p>Caught between the intellectual paralysis of the antipsychotic drugs and his delusions, Nash and his wife decide to try to live with his abnormal condition <a href="/wiki/Schizophrenia" id="w">schizophrenia</a>. Nash attempts to ignore his hallucinations and not feed &#34;his demons&#34;. Nash is growing older while working on his studies in the library of <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton University</a>. He still suffers hallucinations and periodically has to check if new people he meets are real, mentions taking newer medications, but is ultimately able to live with and largely ignore his psychotic experiences. Nash approaches his old friend and intellectual rival Martin Hansen, now head of the Princeton mathematics department, and receives permission to work out of the library and audit classes. He eventually begins teaching again. He is honored by his fellow professors for his achievement in mathematics, and goes on to win the <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_Sweden_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences_in_Memory_of_Alfred_Nobel" id="w">Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics</a> for his revolutionary work on <a href="/wiki/Game_theory" id="w">game theory</a>. Later, Nash and Alicia are about to leave the auditorium in Stockholm, when John sees Charles, Marcee and Parcher standing and smiling. Alicia asks John &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; John replies &#34;Nothing.&#34; With that, they both leave the auditorium.</p>

<a id="Historical_accuracy" name="Historical_accuracy"></a><h1>Historical accuracy</h1>
<p>The film has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of Nash&#39;s life and schizophrenia as well as for the over-simplified representation of the <a href="/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" id="w">Nash equilibrium</a>.
