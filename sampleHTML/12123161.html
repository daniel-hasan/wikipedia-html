<p><a href="/wiki/Blizzard_Entertainment" id="w">Blizzard Entertainment&#39;s</a> 1998 bestselling <a href="/wiki/Real-time_strategy_game" id="w">real-time strategy game</a> series <b><i><a href="/wiki/StarCraft_(series)" id="w">StarCraft</a></i></b> revolves around interstellar affairs in a distant sector of the galaxy, with three species and multiple factions all vying for supremacy in the sector. The original game has sold over 9.5 million copies<sup id="_ref-vivendi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vivendi" title="">[1]</a></sup> internationally, making it one of the top selling games in the PC market. One of the reasons for <i>StarCraft<b>s success is its intricate story, carried by <a href="/wiki/#Critical reception" id="w">generally positively received characters</a> from the industry&#39;s reviewers and journalists. The <i>StarCraft</i> universe, comprising of a number of games, authorized additions and novels, has an extensive list of characters, but only a limited number of these characters have a major influence of the overall story arc.</b></i></p>
<p>Most of the main characters in the <i>StarCraft</i> series are put under the player&#39;s control at some point within the game to some degree; <a href="/wiki/#Jim Raynor" id="w">Jim Raynor</a> and <a href="/wiki/#Fenix" id="w">Fenix</a> are consistently controllable throughout the games, whilst others such as <a href="/wiki/#Edmund Duke" id="w">Edmund Duke</a> appear multiple times but are only accessible in-game to the player once or twice. Some characters, such as <a href="/wiki/#Arcturus Mengsk" id="w">Arcturus Mengsk</a> and <a href="/wiki/#Aldaris" id="w">Aldaris</a> are never put under the control of the player during the course of the games, but feature prominently in the lore of the series. The universe also contains a whole host of minor characters, but these characters are of much lesser significance within isolated areas of the general story.</p>

The characters and story of the <a href="/wiki/StarCraft_(series)" id="w">&#39;&#39;StarCraft&#39;&#39; series</a> were created by <a href="/wiki/Chris_Metzen" id="w">Chris Metzen</a><sup id="_ref-manual_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-manual" title="">[2]</a></sup> and James Phinney.<sup id="_ref-manual_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-manual" title="">[2]</a></sup> However, as Phinney was not involved in <i><a href="/wiki/StarCraft:_Brood_War" id="w">StarCraft: Brood War</a></i>; Chris Metzen alone is credited for the development of the plot in the expansion.<sup id="_ref-BWmanual_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BWmanual" title="">[3]</a></sup> Despite the series&#39; success globally, particularly in <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" id="w">South Korea</a>, Blizzard Entertainment has not made any major comments regarding the development of the characters and the storyline of the <i>StarCraft</i> series.</p>
<p>However, interviews with the two of the voice actors have given a glimpse into small parts of the development process. An interview with Robert Clotworthy, the voice of <a href="/wiki/#Jim Raynor" id="w">Jim Raynor</a> in all released <i>StarCraft</i> games to date, has revealed that for the most part the voicing for the characters was done over only a few days in sessions of up to four hours,<sup id="_ref-clotworthy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clotworthy" title="">[4]</a></sup> a fact mirrored in a similar interview with <a href="/wiki/#Sarah Kerrigan" id="w">Sarah Kerrigan&#39;s</a> actress, <a href="/wiki/Glynnis_Talken_Campbell" id="w">Glynnis Talken Campbell</a>.<sup id="_ref-campbell_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-campbell" title="">[5]</a></sup> Clotworthy also stated how the concept art for the game - usually used for the visual development of characters and locales in games - was used by him in order to develop the personality of his character.<sup id="_ref-clotworthy_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clotworthy" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Visually, most of the characters and units in the games were developed from artwork by Metzen and <a href="/wiki/Samwise_Didier" id="w">Samwise Didier</a>, although at least two other artists - Glen Rane and Peter Lee - have developed concept art for the upcoming <i><a href="/wiki/StarCraft_II" id="w">StarCraft II</a></i>. It is also implied by some of the authors of the novels that the development of the characters in their books was also influenced by Metzen<sup id="_ref-ShadowAcknowledgements_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ShadowAcknowledgements" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-QueenAcknowledgements_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-QueenAcknowledgements" title="">[7]</a></sup> as well as Andy Chambers and Evelyn Fredericksen.<sup id="_ref-golden_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-golden" title="">[8]</a></sup> This is particularly notable for characters later appearing in the games, such as <a href="/wiki/#Valerian Mengsk" id="w">Valerian Mengsk</a>.</p>

<p><b>Samir Duran</b> is one of the most mysterious beings in the <i>StarCraft</i> series. Throughout the game, Duran&#39;s character, alliances and motives change from the player&#39;s point of view. In a hidden mission, his role and true nature are made even more mysterious. Fan speculations link Duran to nearly every faction and character in the game, but the most common theory is that he is a <a href="/wiki/Xel%26%2339%3BNaga" id="w">Xel&#39;Naga</a>. Duran&#39;s voice is provided by Paul Ainsley<sup id="_ref-BWcasting_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BWcasting" title="">[9]</a></sup> and he is represented in-game as a <a href="/wiki/Psionic_technology_(StarCraft)#Ghost agents" id="w">ghost agent</a> in both Terran and infested Terran forms, although the two subtly differ.</p>
<p>Duran first appears as a leader of an anti-<a href="/wiki/Terran_Dominion" id="w">Dominion</a> resistance force early in <i>Brood War</i> Episode V,<sup id="_ref-ep5m1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep5m1" title="">[17]</a></sup> and allies with the <a href="/wiki/United_Earth_Directorate" id="w">United Earth Directorate</a>. Although Duran provides invaluable data on the Dominion to the UED, he also allows Zerg to overwhelm their strike forces on <a href="/wiki/Aiur" id="w">Aiur</a>, sabotaging the objectives of that mission and allowing the Dominion emperor to escape.<sup id="_ref-ep5m6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep5m6" title="">[18]</a></sup> As a result, Vice-Admiral <a href="/wiki/#Alexei Stukov" id="w">Alexei Stukov</a> suspects him of being a traitor late in Episode V, at which point Duran kills him<sup id="_ref-ep5m7_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep5m7" title="">[19]</a></sup> and shows that he is working with <a href="/wiki/#Sarah Kerrigan" id="w">Sarah Kerrigan</a>,<sup id="_ref-ep5m8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep5m8" title="">[20]</a></sup> revealing himself as an infested Terran. With Duran as her advisor, Kerrigan successfully establishes herself as the dominant power in the sector, taking command of the majority of the Zerg Swarm in Episode VI. However, despite his valued assistance, Duran vanishes shortly before Kerrigan is attacked in <i>Brood War<b>s final mission. He is discovered by <a href="/wiki/Zeratul" id="w">Zeratul</a> in a secret mission on an unknown geological satellite, engineering a Protoss/Zerg hybrid.<sup id="_ref-ep6bonus_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep6bonus" title="">[21]</a></sup> At this point Duran states clearly that his work has little to do with Kerrigan, and that he in fact serves what he describes as &#34;a far greater power&#34;.</b></i></p>
<p>Due to a lack of appearances in any other media, Duran&#39;s true nature is a mystery, and Blizzard Entertainment has not elaborated on his character. What is for certain is that Duran is highly intelligent and manipulative, demonstrating a degree of knowledge of Protoss technology<sup id="_ref-ep6bonus_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep6bonus" title="">[21]</a></sup> and Zerg control hierarchy,<sup id="_ref-ep5m3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep5m3" title="">[22]</a></sup> along with inside knowledge of several Terran factions. He is able to fool the UED into thinking he is a thirty-three year old<sup id="_ref-BWmanual_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BWmanual" title="">[3]</a></sup> human and Kerrigan into thinking he is infested when he is neither, although the means by which he accomplishes this are not known. Duran also claims to have &#34;had many names throughout the millennia&#34;, displaying that he is far older than any other character in <i>StarCraft</i>; even the extremely long lived Protoss rarely live over a single millennium.</p>

<p><b>Arcturus Mengsk</b> is a major character in the <i><a href="/wiki/StarCraft" id="w">StarCraft</a></i> series and commands the player&#39;s missions through most of Episode I. Aged thirty-eight,<sup id="_ref-manual_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-manual" title="">[2]</a></sup> he becomes the emperor of the <a href="/wiki/Terran_Dominion" id="w">Terran Dominion</a> and as such the ruler of the majority of the Terrans in the sector. The original <i>StarCraft</i> documents Mengsk&#39;s rise to power, and subsequent novels and games have depicted him as growing in strength. Mengsk was originally planned to appear in-game piloting the battlecruiser <i>Leviathan</i>, but this idea was scrapped, although third party campaign editors still refer to his unit as a battlecruiser. Mengsk is voiced by Jason Hayes in both <i>StarCraft</i><sup id="_ref-casting_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-casting" title="">[23]</a></sup> and <i><a href="/wiki/StarCraft:_Brood_War" id="w">StarCraft: Brood War</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-BWcasting_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BWcasting" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>The matriarch does not feature in the game again until the late stages of Episode VI, when Kerrigan and <a href="/wiki/#Samir Duran" id="w">Duran</a> abduct her from a fortified outpost on Shakuras.<sup id="_ref-ep6m7_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep6m7" title="">[74]</a></sup> Kerrigan then uses Raszagal to persuade Zeratul to assassinate the second Zerg Overmind,<sup id="_ref-ep6m8_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep6m8" title="">[49]</a></sup> after which it is revealed that Raszagal had been controlled by Kerrigan since before the events of Episode IV<sup id="_ref-ep6m8_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep6m8" title="">[49]</a></sup> and that Raszagal was following Kerrigan&#39;s objectives for dominance. However, Zeratul&#39;s forces recapture Raszagal, but are unable to hold off the Zerg forces long enough to escape.

In addition to the main characters, the <i>StarCraft</i> series also has a significant roster of supporting characters. These characters are usually main characters in their prospective source - for example, <a href="/wiki/List_of_minor_characters_in_the_StarCraft_universe#Michael Liberty" id="w">Michael Liberty</a> is the central character to <i><a href="/wiki/StarCraft:_Liberty%26%2339%3Bs_Crusade" id="w">StarCraft: Liberty&#39;s Crusade</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_minor_characters_in_the_StarCraft_universe#Jack Frost" id="w">Jack Frost</a> is a key character in <i><a href="/wiki/Insurrection_(StarCraft)" id="w">Insurrection</a></i> - but do not have any major influence on the overall storyline outside these mediums. Whilst their contributions are noteworthy in expanding the universe, they can be regarded as minor characters within the entirety of the <i>StarCraft</i> series.</p>

The characters of <i>StarCraft</i> have been popular enough to inspire the creation of several collectable statues and toys. The first series of statues was released by <a href="/wiki/ToyCom" id="w">ToyCom</a> in 2003, consisting of a firebat<sup id="_ref-atamaiifirebat_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-atamaiifirebat" title="">[75]</a></sup> with markings similar to some original <i>StarCraft</i> concept art for the firebat,<sup id="_ref-conceptfirebat_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-conceptfirebat" title="">[76]</a></sup> a hydralisk<sup id="_ref-atamaiihydra_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-atamaiihydra" title="">[77]</a></sup> and one of Tassadar<sup id="_ref-atamaiitassadar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-atamaiitassadar" title="">[78]</a></sup> with a ceremonial sword, which is also seen in concept art for the original game.<sup id="_ref-concepttassadar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-concepttassadar" title="">[79]</a></sup> A series of toys were also made available in 1998,<sup id="_ref-IGNSCtoys_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNSCtoys" title="">[80]</a></sup> featuring two variations of the marine, another hydralisk and a Protoss zealot. In addition, 1/30 scale model kits for the marine<sup id="_ref-marinemodel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-marinemodel" title="">[81]</a></sup> and hydralisk<sup id="_ref-hydramodel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hydramodel" title="">[82]</a></sup> were released in 1999 by <a href="/wiki/Academy_Plastic_Model_Co." id="w">Academy Hobby Model Kits</a>.</p>
<p>A second series of collectable statues, which included infested Kerrigan,<sup id="_ref-atamaiikerri_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-atamaiikerri" title="">[83]</a></sup> Zeratul<sup id="_ref-atamaiizeratul_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-atamaiizeratul" title="">[84]</a></sup> and a Terran ghost,<sup id="_ref-atamaiighost_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-atamaiighost" title="">[85]</a></sup> was in development but appears to have been cancelled. However, upon announcement of <i>StarCraft II</i> in 2007, Blizzard released a new collectable statue depicting their mascot character Tychus Findlay.<sup id="_ref-sc2statue_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sc2statue" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Critical_reception" name="Critical_reception"></a><h2>Critical reception</h2>

<p>The characters and story of the <i>StarCraft</i> series have been received with praise and only minute criticism by many game reviewers. The <a href="/wiki/GameSpot" id="w">GameSpot</a> review of <i>StarCraft</i> described the voice acting as &#34;great&#34;, stating that it brings the characters to life.<sup id="_ref-gamespotSC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespotSC" title="">[86]</a></sup> GameSpot goes further in the review for <i>Brood War</i>, commenting that the story and dialogue is with only a few exceptions &#34;brilliantly written&#34; and &#34;one the year&#39;s best stories in any gaming genre&#34;.<sup id="_ref-gamespotBW_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespotBW" title="">[87]</a></sup> The reviewer of <i>StarCraft</i> for <a href="/wiki/IGN" id="w">IGN</a> praises the melding of the story into the gameplay and implies that the development of the characters during the course of the story, particularly that of <a href="/wiki/#Sarah Kerrigan" id="w">Kerrigan</a>, is unforgettable.<sup id="_ref-ignSC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignSC" title="">[88]</a></sup> In addition, the review of <i>Brood War</i> puts the storyline as &#34;solid&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ignBW_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignBW" title="">[89]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Gaming Revolution</i> echoed this praise, saying the plot is &#34;fantastic&#34;, but the reviewer added that he felt it was &#34;over too quickly&#34;.<sup id="_ref-GamingRevolutionSC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GamingRevolutionSC" title="">[90]</a></sup> At <i>GamePro.com</i>, the reviewer cited that he felt &#34;the characters were talking to me&#34; and even expressed a development of an emotional attachment to the character of <a href="/wiki/#Jim Raynor" id="w">Raynor</a>.<sup id="_ref-gameproSC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gameproSC" title="">[91]</a></sup> <i>Electric Playground</i> put the story as the best part of the game, if a little derivative, but described the voice acting as &#34;really quite excellent&#34;.<sup id="_ref-electricplaygroundSC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-electricplaygroundSC" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>
<p>Individual characters have also received praise, such as the readers of GameSpot citing Kerrigan as the second best villain in computer gaming<sup id="_ref-gamespotvillains_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespotvillains" title="">[93]</a></sup> whilst putting <a href="/wiki/#Zeratul" id="w">Zeratul</a> in the top ten of the best heroes in all video games.<sup id="_ref-gamespotheroes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespotheroes" title="">[94]</a></sup></p>
