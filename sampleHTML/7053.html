A <b>cannon</b> is a large tubular <a href="/wiki/Firearm" id="w">firearm</a> that uses <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" id="w">gunpowder</a> to fire a heavy <a href="/wiki/Projectile" id="w">projectile</a> over a long distance. They were <a href="/wiki/History_of_cannon" id="w">first used</a> in <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a>, and were the archetypal form of <a href="/wiki/Artillery" id="w">artillery</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Cannon_in_the_Middle_Ages" id="w">first cannon in Europe</a> probably appeared in <a href="/wiki/Al-Andalus" id="w">Islamic</a> and Christian <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>. <a href="/wiki/English_cannon" id="w">English cannons</a> were first used during the <a href="/wiki/Hundred_Years_War" id="w">Hundred Years War</a>, when primitive cannon were used at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Cr%C3%A9cy" id="w">Battle of Cr√©cy</a> in 1346. The end of the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a> saw the construction of larger and more powerful cannon, and their spread in warfare throughout the world. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Asia" id="w">Asia</a> saw the construction of some of the world&#39;s largest cannon, such as the <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">Indian</a> <a href="/wiki/Jaivana_cannon" id="w">Jaivana cannon</a>. The &#34;giant gun&#34; trend was by then disappearing in Europe, in favor of larger numbers of lighter, more maneuverable pieces. This eventually lead to the use of modern field artillery. While the medieval <a href="/wiki/Great_Turkish_Bombard" id="w">Dardanelles Gun</a> had required 200 men to <a href="/wiki/Cannon_operation" id="w">operate</a> it, 18th century English cannon required only a dozen men, including two gunners, while during the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" id="w">Napoleonic Wars</a> five gunners were used.</p>
<p>Cannon fire are also sometimes used in certain pieces of music, such as <a href="/wiki/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky" id="w">Tchaikovsky</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/1812_Overture" id="w">1812 Overture</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/AC/DC" id="w">AC/DC</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/For_Those_About_to_Rock_(We_Salute_You)_(song)" id="w">For those about to rock, we salute you</a></i>.</p>
<p>Retired or abandoned cannons are often preserved for display in places appropriate to their use, such as battlefields, military bases, and harbours, whence the ships that bore them set sail.  Cannon recovered from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water, and <a href="/wiki/Extractive_metallurgy" id="w">electrolytic reduction treatment</a> is required to forestall the process of corrosion. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Bacon described firecrackers, &#34;used in certain parts of the world&#34;. Bacon&#39;s mixture resembles the assumed composition of Chinese slow-burning powder as used in fire arrows and rockets, but will probably not function well as cannon gunpowder - the saltpeter content is too low.</p>

The end of the Middle Ages saw the construction of larger and more powerful cannon, and their spread in warfare throughout the world. The <a href="/wiki/Tsar_Cannon" id="w">Tsar Cannon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Foundry" id="w">founded</a> by Russian founding master <a href="/wiki/Andrey_Chokhov" id="w">Andrey Chokhov</a> in 1586, was the largest <a href="/wiki/Howitzer" id="w">howitzer</a> ever made. The cannon, which still survives today, was intended to fire <a href="/wiki/Grapeshot" id="w">grapeshot</a> and to defend <a href="/wiki/The_Kremlin" id="w">the Kremlin</a>, but was never used. In fact, with such a large cannon, it may have been intended as a showpiece of military might and engineering from the beginning. </p>
<p>Conventional siege artillery, such as <a href="/wiki/Siege_tower" id="w">siege towers</a> and trebuchets, became vulnerable and obsolete with the development of large cannon and changes in fortification. However, wooden &#34;battery-towers&#34; took on a similar role as siege towers in the <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" id="w">gunpowder</a> age, such as that used at <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Kazan" id="w">siege of Kazan</a> in 1552, which could hold ten large-calibre cannon and 50 lighter cannon.<sup id="_ref-Kazan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kazan" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>As wheeled gun carriages became more common by the end of the 15th century, field artillery began to emerge.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Art_of_War_(Machiavelli)" id="w">The Art of War</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli" id="w">Niccol√≤ Machiavelli</a> observed that &#34;small pieces of cannon‚Ä¶ do more damage than heavy artillery.

<p>Most notable in this period, however, is the effect of cannon on conventional fortifications.

<p>Forts featuring <a href="/wiki/Artillery_battery" id="w">cannon batteries</a> were built during the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" id="w">Renaissance</a>, such as the <i><a href="/wiki/Trace_italienne" id="w">trace italienne</a></i> of <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Tudor_dynasty" id="w">Tudors</a>&#39; <a href="/wiki/Device_Forts" id="w">Device Forts</a> in England.<sup id="_ref-Castles81_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Castles81" title="">[30]</a></sup> To guard against artillery and gunfire, increasing use was made of earthen, brick and stone <a href="/wiki/Breastwork_(fortification)" id="w">breastworks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Redoubt" id="w">redoubts</a>, such as the geometric &#34;<a href="/wiki/Star_fort" id="w">Star forts</a>&#34; of the 17th century French <a href="/wiki/Marquis_de_Vauban" id="w">Marquis de Vauban</a>.

The lower tier of 17th century English <a href="/wiki/Ship_of_the_Line" id="w">ships of the line</a> were usually equipped with demi-cannon ‚Äî a <a href="/wiki/Navy" id="w">naval</a> <a href="/wiki/Gun" id="w">gun</a> which fired a 32-pound solid shot. A full cannon at this time fired a 42-pound shot, but these were discontinued by the 18th century as they were seen as too unwieldy. By the end of the century, principles long adopted in Europe specified the characteristics of cannon of the British ship design and the types and sizes of acceptable defects.  The U.S. Navy tested guns by measurement, proof by powder (two or three firings), and using compressed water for leak detection.<sup id="_ref-NavyBarbaryI_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NavyBarbaryI" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Carronade" id="w">carronade</a> was adopted by the Royal Navy in 1779, and the lower muzzle velocity of the <a href="/wiki/Round_shot" id="w">round shot</a> was intended to create many more of the deadly wooden <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Splinter">splinters</a> when hitting the structure of an enemy vessel. It was much shorter and a third to a quarter of the weight of an equivalent <a href="/wiki/Long_gun" id="w">long gun</a>: for example, a 32 pounder carronade weighed less than a <a href="/wiki/Ton" id="w">ton</a>, but a 32 pounder long gun weighed over 3 tons. The guns were thus easier to handle and also required less than half the gunpowder of long guns mounted on naval garrison carriages, allowing fewer men to crew them.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Carronades were manufactured in the usual naval gun <a href="/wiki/Calibre" id="w">calibres</a>, but they were not counted in a <a href="/wiki/Ship_of_the_line" id="w">ship of the line</a>&#39;s rated number of guns.  As a result, the classification of Royal Navy vessels in this period can mislead, since they would often be carrying more pieces of ordnance than were listed.</p>
<p>The Turkish cannons of the siege of Constantinople, after being on permanent display for four centuries, were used to battle a British fleet in 1807. The artillery hit a British ship with two 700 pound cannonballs, killing 60 sailors. In 1867, Sultan Abdul Aziz gifted <a href="/wiki/Queen_Victoria" id="w">Queen Victoria</a> the 17 ton &#34;Dardanelles Gun&#34; - one of the cannons used at the siege of Constantinople.<sup id="_ref-Trivia Library_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Trivia Library" title="">[23]</a></sup>

But in contrast to these antiquated weapons, later western guns during the 19th century became massive, destructive, more accurate, and covered a very long range - such as the American 3 inch wrought-iron muzzle-loading <a href="/wiki/Howitzer" id="w">howitzer</a> used during the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a> with an effective range of over 1.1 miles (1.83Km). In the 1810s and 1820s, greater emphasis was placed on the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a broadside. The carronade, although initially very successful and widely adopted, disappeared from the Royal Navy from the 1850s after the development of steel, jacketed cannon by <a href="/wiki/William_George_Armstrong" id="w">William George Armstrong</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Whitworth" id="w">Joseph Whitworth</a>. Nevertheless, carronades were used in the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a> in the 1860s.</p>
<p>The practice of <a href="/wiki/Rifling" id="w">rifling</a>, involving casting spiralling lines inside the barrel, was first applied to artillery in the 1860s, giving new cannon <a href="/wiki/Gyroscope" id="w">gyroscopic</a> stability and improving their accuracy. The cynical attitude towards recruited infantry in the face of ever more powerful field artillery is the source of the term &#34;<a href="/wiki/Cannon_fodder" id="w">cannon fodder</a>&#34;, first used by <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-Ren%C3%A9_de_Chateaubriand" id="w">Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand</a> in <a href="/wiki/1814" id="w">1814</a>;<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> although the concept of regarding soldiers as nothing more than &#34;food for powder&#34; dates back at least to <a href="/wiki/Shakespeare" id="w">Shakespeare</a>&#39;s time.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>The superior cannon technology of Westerners in later years would bring them tremendous advantages in warfare. For example, in the <a href="/wiki/Opium_War" id="w">Opium War</a> in China during the 19th century, the British battleships bombarded the coastal areas and fortifications safe from the reach of the Chinese cannon. Similarly, the shortest war on the record, the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Zanzibar_War" id="w">Anglo-Zanzibar War</a> of 1896, was brought to a swift conclusion by shelling from British battleships.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>

<p>A modern cannon is a dual-purpose weapon. It can operate as a direct fire, low trajectory, high velocity weapon, firing directly at its target like a modern main battle <a href="/wiki/Tank" id="w">tank</a>. It can also operate as a lower velocity, high trajectory, <a href="/wiki/Indirect_fire" id="w">indirect fire</a> weapon or howitzer. Since <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, the term has been used to refer to a gun of around 20 mm to 125 mm calibre, sometimes with an automatic loading <a href="/wiki/Firearm_action" id="w">action</a> capable of firing explosive <a href="/wiki/Ammunition" id="w">ammunition</a>, an <i><a href="/wiki/Auto-cannon" id="w">auto-cannon</a></i>. Lower <a href="/wiki/Muzzle_velocity" id="w">muzzle velocity</a> modern artillery is used almost exclusively in the <a href="/wiki/Indirect_fire" id="w">indirect fire</a> mode, while higher-velocity cannons from 20 mm up to 125 mm calibre are used in a <a href="/wiki/Direct_fire" id="w">direct fire</a> mode. Nevertheless, tanks can fire high trajectory missions and artillery cannons can fire direct fire missions if the battlefield situation calls for it. Both tank and artillery gunners are trained for these non-typical missions.</p>
<p>The minimum calibre of a cannon, 20 mm, has been a <i><a href="/wiki/De_facto" id="w">de facto</a></i> standard since World War II, when heavy machine guns of 12.7 mm (0.5 inches) and 13.2 mm calibre were used side by side with 20 mm and larger guns, the latter using explosive ammunition (<i>eg.</i> <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" id="w">RAF</a> fighters with 20 mm Hispano cannon and <a href="/wiki/Luftwaffe" id="w">Luftwaffe</a> with 20 mm and <a href="/wiki/30_mm_caliber" id="w">30 mm</a> cannon).

Cannon operation during the 18th century is described by the 1771 <i><a href="/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica" id="w">Encyclop√¶dia Britannica</a></i>. Each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, while the left gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine and keep ready to fire the cannon at the officer&#39;s command.  Three soldiers stood on each side of the cannon, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left was charged with providing 50 bullets.<sup id="_ref-EB1771_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EB1771" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Prior to loading, the cannon would be well cleaned with a wet sponge to extinguish any smoldering material from the last shot (because fresh powder was about to be poured in, and any lingering ignition sources would set it off prematurely). The powder was added, followed by a wad of paper or hay, and the ball was thrown in. After ramming the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range‚Äîabout ten times the gun&#39;s level range. Any angle above the horizontal line was called random-shot. The officer of artillery had to ensure the cannon was diligently served. Water was available to dip the sponges in and cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.<sup id="_ref-EB1771_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EB1771" title="">[40]</a></sup>

It was said that a 24-pounder could fire 90 to 100 shots a day in summer, or 60 to 75 in winter. A 16- or 12-pounder would fire a little more, because they were easier served. The Britannica mentions &#34;some occasions where 200 shots have been fired from these pieces in the space of nine hours, and 138 in the space of five.&#34;<sup id="_ref-EB1771_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EB1771" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" id="w">Napoleonic Wars</a>, a British gun team consisted of 5 numbered gunners. The gun&#39;s &#34;No. 1&#34; was the gun commander, and a sergeant, who aimed the gun. The No. 2 was the &#34;spongeman&#34; who cleaned the bore with the sponge dampened with water between shots; the intention being to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced. The No. 3, the loader, inserted the bag of powder and then the projectile. The No. 2 then used a rammer, or the sponge reversed, to drive it in. At the same time, the No. 4 (&#34;ventsman&#34;) pressed his thumb on the vent hole to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the No. 4 pricked the bagged charge through the vent hole and filled the vent with powder. At the No. 1&#39;s command the No. 5 would fire the piece with his slowmatch.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<a id="In_music" name="In_music"></a><h1>In music</h1>
<p>The cannon can be used as a kind of <a href="/wiki/Percussion" id="w">percussion</a> instrument in certain pieces of music. The best known example is the <i><a href="/wiki/1812_Overture" id="w">1812 Overture</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky" id="w">Tchaikovsky</a>, which should properly be played using an artillery section together with the orchestra. It is supposed to simulate the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Borodino" id="w">Battle of Borodino</a>. The version using cannon fire was first laid down on a  recording by the <a href="/wiki/Minneapolis_Symphony_Orchestra" id="w">Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra</a> in the 1950s. Subsequent similar recordings have been made by other groups, exploiting the advances in audio technology. Cannon fire is used annually on the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_of_July" id="w">Fourth of July</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Boston_Pops" id="w">Boston Pops</a> during their annual concert on the shores of the Charles River and by the <a href="/wiki/National_Symphony_Orchestra_(United_States)" id="w">National Symphony Orchestra</a> during their annual concert on the steps of the US Capitol Building.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Hard_rock" id="w">hard rock</a> band <a href="/wiki/AC/DC" id="w">AC/DC</a> also use cannon in their song <i><a href="/wiki/For_Those_About_to_Rock_(We_Salute_You)_(song)" id="w">For Those About to Rock, We Salute You</a></i>. The <a href="/wiki/For_Those_About_to_Rock" id="w">album of the same name</a> also features a cannon on its cover. They had even used real cannons for their live shows.</p>
<p>Due to their impracticalities, cannon are used for only grand, theatrical pieces, often with a military theme. In the case of the <i>1812</i>, the cannon may be replaced with <a href="/wiki/Bass_drum" id="w">bass drums</a> or <a href="/wiki/Timpani" id="w">timpani</a>. Less frequently strongly accented snare drum diminuendos can be heard.</p>
