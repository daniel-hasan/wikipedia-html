<p>Perón and his second wife <a href="/wiki/Eva_Per%C3%B3n" id="w">Eva</a> were immensely popular among a portion of the Argentine people and still considered iconic figures by followers of the <a href="/wiki/Peronist_Party" id="w">Peronist Party</a>. Perón followers lauded his efforts to eliminate <a href="/wiki/Poverty" id="w">poverty</a> and to dignify labor, while his detractors considered him a <a href="/wiki/Demagogy" id="w">demagogue</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Dictator" id="w">dictator</a>; despite the former afirmation, a lot of detractors didn&#39;t consider him as a dictator (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Alfons%C3%ADn" id="w">Raúl Alfonsín</a>, <a href="/wiki/Guillermo_Est%C3%A9vez_Boero" id="w">Guillermo Estévez Boero</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maria_Julia_Alsogaray" id="w">Maria Julia Alsogaray</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Alende" id="w">Oscar Alende</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jose_Luis_Romero" id="w">Jose Luis Romero</a>, <a href="/wiki/Federico_Storani" id="w">Federico Storani</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mauricio_Macri" id="w">Mauricio Macri</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elisa_Carri%C3%B3" id="w">Elisa Carrió</a>, etc.) Perón gave his name to the political movement known as <a href="/wiki/Peronism" id="w">Peronism</a>, and upheld by the <a href="/wiki/Justicialist_Party" id="w">Justicialist Party</a>.</p>
<a id="Childhood_and_youth" name="Childhood_and_youth"></a><h2>Childhood and youth</h2>
<p>Perón was born in a town near <a href="/wiki/Lobos" id="w">Lobos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Province_of_Buenos_Aires" id="w">Province of Buenos Aires</a>.  He was the son of Mario Tomás Perón, a farmer whose family was partly <a href="/wiki/Scottish_people" id="w">Scottish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Italian_people" id="w">Italian</a>, and Juana Sosa, who is believed to have been of mixed <a href="/wiki/Spanish_people" id="w">Spanish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" id="w">American Indian</a> descent. </p>
<p>Further research undertaken by the Argentine journalist and writer <a href="/wiki/Tom%C3%A1s_Eloy_Mart%C3%ADnez" id="w">Tomás Eloy Martínez</a>, and reported in his books &#34;Memoirs of the General&#34; and &#34;The Perón Novel&#34;, indicate that Perón was probably illegitimate.{{Fact}}  When his parents finally married, they acknowledged Juan and his brother.  It is believed this information was kept hidden and denied for years because it would have likely ruined Perón&#39;s career had it been known.</p>
<p>Perón married his first wife, <a href="/wiki/Aurelia_Tiz%C3%B3n" id="w">Aurelia Tizón</a>, on  <a href="/wiki/January_5" id="w">January 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1929" id="w">1929</a>, but she died of <a href="/wiki/Uterine_cancer" id="w">uterine cancer</a> nine years later.  He called her &#34;Potota.&#34;</p>
<p>Perón received a strict <a href="/wiki/Catholic" id="w">Catholic</a> upbringing.  He entered a military school at age 16, and following graduation he made good progress through the ranks.  In 1938 he was sent by the Army to <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hungary" id="w">Hungary</a>, <a href="/wiki/Albania" id="w">Albania</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia" id="w">Yugoslavia</a> as a military observer, during which time he became familiar with the government of <a href="/wiki/Benito_Mussolini" id="w">Benito Mussolini</a> and other European governments of the time.</p>

<p>In May 1943, as a <a href="/wiki/Colonel" id="w">colonel</a>, he was a significant figure in the <a href="/wiki/Military_coup" id="w">military coup</a> by the GOU (<a href="/wiki/United_Officers%26%2339%3B_Group" id="w">United Officers&#39; Group</a>), a secret society, against the conservative civilian government of <a href="/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Castillo" id="w">Ramón Castillo</a>.

Perón&#39;s growing power and influence during the military government came from his alliance with a sector of the Argentine <a href="/wiki/Labor_union" id="w">labor unions</a>, mainly with the <a href="/wiki/Socialist" id="w">socialist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Syndicalism" id="w">syndicalist</a> movements<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>
.  After the coup, one part of the workers&#39; movement, mainly the socialist part from the labor union <a href="/wiki/General_Confederation_of_Labour_(Argentina)" id="w">CGT</a> Nº1, decided to make contact with Colonels Perón and <a href="/wiki/Mercante" id="w">Mercante</a> through the mercantile labor leader <a href="/wiki/Borlenghi" id="w">Borlenghi</a> and through the <a href="/wiki/Railroad" id="w">railroad</a> union <a href="/wiki/Lawyer" id="w">lawyer</a> <a href="/wiki/Bramuglia" id="w">Bramuglia</a>.His best friend was Nickolis vanhalon Their conversations established an initial alliance to promote labor laws that had long been demanded by the workers&#39; movement, strengthen the unions, and transform the  Department of Labor into an important government office. </p>
<p>He became Vice President and Secretary of War under General <a href="/wiki/Edelmiro_Farrell" id="w">Edelmiro Farrell</a> (February 1944).  Forced into resignation by opponents within the <a href="/wiki/Armed_forces" id="w">armed forces</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_9" id="w">October 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>, Perón was arrested, but mass <a href="/wiki/Demonstration_(people)" id="w">demonstrations</a> organized by the CGT <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" id="w">trade union</a> federation forced his release on <a href="/wiki/October_17" id="w">October 17</a>.  Four days later, he married his second wife, <a href="/wiki/Eva_Duarte_de_Per%C3%B3n" id="w">Eva Duarte</a> (1919&#8211;1952), who became hugely popular.  Known as Evita, she helped her husband develop support with labor and women&#39;s groups.</p>

<p>Perón leveraged his popular support into victory in the <a href="/wiki/February_24" id="w">February 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1946" id="w">1946</a> presidential elections. </p>
<p>Once in office, Perón pursued social policies aimed at empowering the working class.  He greatly expanded the number of unionized workers, and helped establish the powerful <a href="/wiki/General_Confederation_of_Labour_(Argentina)" id="w">General Confederation of Labour (CGT)</a>, created in 1930.  He called this the &#34;third position&#34;, between capitalism and communism.  Perón also pushed hard to industrialize the country; in 1947 he announced the first <a href="/wiki/Five-year_plan" id="w">five-year plan</a> to boost newly nationalized industries.  <a href="/wiki/Peronism" id="w">Peronism</a> became a central influence in Argentine political parties, and Perón continued to exert a strong influence after the 1955 <a href="/wiki/Revoluci%C3%B3n_Libertadora" id="w">military uprising</a> which forced him into exile.</p>
<p>Among the upper class Argentines, the improvement of the laborers&#39; situation was a source of resentment; negative feelings abounded towards the new industrial workers from rural areas, who had formerly been treated as servants.  It was common for better-off Argentines to refer to these workers using racist slurs like <i>&#34;black heads&#34;</i> (cabecitas negras, the name of a like bird), <i>&#34;fats&#34;</i> (&#34;grasas&#34;), <i>&#34;un-shirted&#34;</i> (&#34;descamisados&#34;, conveying the idea that they &#34;took off their jackets and/or shirts&#34;), and the <a href="/wiki/Radical_Civic_Union" id="w">radical</a> deputy <a href="/wiki/Ernesto_Sammartino" id="w">Ernesto Sammartino</a> said that the people who vote for Perón were a &#34;<i>zoological flood</i>&#34; (&#34;aluvión zoológico&#34;).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  In the 1940s the upper-class students were the first group to oppose Peronist workers, using the slogan: <i>&#34;<a href="/wiki/Peon" id="w">peon</a>-footwear [=espadrilles] dictatorship, NO!&#34;</i> (&#34;No a la dictadura de las alpargatas&#34;).  Another famous graffito revealing the strong opposition between Peronists and anti-Peronists appeared in high-class districts in the 1950s saying, <i>&#34;Long live cancer!&#34;</i> (¡Viva el cáncer!), when <a href="/wiki/Eva_Per%C3%B3n" id="w">Eva Perón</a> was dying of cancer.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  She finally died of <a href="/wiki/Uterine_cancer" id="w">uterine cancer</a> in 1952 at the age of thirty-three.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Weiss (2005, p.45) recalls events related to the universities:
</p><blockquote>&#34;As a young student in Buenos Aires in the early 1950s, I well remember the graffiti found in many an empty wall all over town: &#39;Build the Fatherland. Kill a Student&#39; (<i>Haga patria, mate un estudiante</i>). [Perón] was also against the universities, who questioned his methods and his goals.  A well-remembered slogan runs, <i>Alpargatas sí, libros no</i> (&#39;<a href="/wiki/Peon" id="w">peon</a> footwear [=espadrilles]  yes, books no&#39;). Universities were [then] &#39;intervened&#39;.  In some, a <i>Peronista</i> mediocrity was appointed rector.  Others were closed for years.&#34;</blockquote>

<p>Between 1947 and 1950, Argentina manufactured two advanced jet aircraft called <a href="/wiki/I.Ae._27_Pulqui_I" id="w">Pulqui I</a> (designed  by the Argentine engineers Cardehilac, Morchio and Ricciardi with the French <a href="/wiki/Emile_Dewoitine" id="w">Emile Dewoitine</a>, condemned in France in absentia for <a href="/wiki/Collaborationism" id="w">Collaborationism</a>), and <a href="/wiki/FMA_IAe_33_Pulqui_II" id="w">Pulqui II</a> designed by <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Tank" id="w">Kurt Tank</a>.  In the main test flights the planes were flown by Argentine Lieutenant Edmundo Osvaldo Weiss and Kurt Tank himself, reaching 1000 km/h with the Pulqui II.  Argentina continued testing the Pulqui II until 1959; during that time two pilots lost their lives.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The Pulqui project opened the door to develop two successful Argentinian planes: <a class="externallink" href="http://www.choiquehobbies.com.ar/revista/notas/pucara/Pucara.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.choiquehobbies.com.ar/revista/notas/pucara/Pucara.htm">I.A.58&#34;Pucara</a> and the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/material/pampa.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/material/pampa.html">I.A.63&#39;Pampa</a> manufactured at the Aircraft Factory of Córdoba.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1951, Perón announced that the <a href="/wiki/Huemul_Project" id="w">Huemul Project</a> would produce nuclear fusion before any other country.  In charge of the project was an Austrian of German origin, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Richter" id="w">Ronald Richter</a>, who had been recommended by Kurt Tank who was expecting to power his aircraft with Richter&#39;s invention.  Perón announced that the energy produced by Richter would be delivered in milk-bottle sized containers.  Success of the project was announced in 1951, but no proof was shown.  On 1952 Perón appointed a scientific team to investigate Richter&#39;s activities.  The reports by <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Antonio_Balseiro" id="w">José Antonio Balseiro</a>, and Mario Báncora revealed that the project was a fraud.  After that, the assets of the Huemul Project were transferred to the Centro Atómico Bariloche (CAB) of the Argentine <a href="/wiki/National_Atomic_Energy_Commission" id="w">National Atomic Energy Commission</a> (CNEA) and to the physics institute of the <a href="/wiki/Universidad_Nacional_de_Cuyo" id="w">Universidad Nacional de Cuyo</a> which was later named <a href="/wiki/Instituto_Balseiro" id="w">Instituto Balseiro</a> (IB). </p>

After World War II, Argentina became a leading haven for Nazi war criminals, with the explicit protection of Juan Perón. Historian <a href="/wiki/Uki_Go%C3%B1i" id="w">Uki Goñi</a> showed in his 1998 book that along with Nazis and French and Belgian <a href="/wiki/Collaborationists" id="w">collaborationists</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Daye" id="w">Pierre Daye</a>, Perón organized a meeting in the <i><a href="/wiki/Casa_Rosada" id="w">Casa Rosada</a></i> during which a network was created, which benefited from support by the Immigration Service and diplomatic civil servants. The Swiss Chief of Police Heinrich Rothmund <a class="externallink" href="http://www.millersville.edu/~holo-con/epstein.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.millersville.edu/~holo-con/epstein.html">http://www.millersville.edu/~holo-con/epstein.html</a> and the Croatian Roman Catholic priest <a href="/wiki/Krunoslav_Draganovi%C4%87" id="w">Krunoslav Draganović</a> also helped organize the <a href="/wiki/Ratlines_(history)" id="w">ratline</a> <sup id="_ref-PaginaUki_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PaginaUki" title="">[7]</a></sup>. According to Goñi, 1948 was the most active year, during which the SS <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Fuldner" id="w">Carlos Fuldner</a> was in Switzerland with a special passport which described him as &#34;special envoy of the President of Argentina.&#34; In 1946, Cardinal <a href="/wiki/Antonio_Caggiano" id="w">Antonio Caggiano</a> went to the <a href="/wiki/Apostolic_Palace" id="w">Vatican</a> to offer his country, in the name of the Argentine government, as a refuge for French collaborationists who had fled to Rome <sup id="_ref-PaginaUki_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PaginaUki" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The network was managed by <a href="/wiki/Rodolfo_Freude" id="w">Rodolfo Freude</a> who had an office in the Casa Rosada and was close to Eva Perón&#39;s brother, <a href="/wiki/Juan_Duarte" id="w">Juan Duarte</a>, as the <a href="/wiki/DAIA" id="w">DAIA</a> found out in 1997, investigating 22,000 documents. According to the historian Ronald Newton, <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_Freude" id="w">Ludwig Freude</a>, father of the first, was the probable local representative of the Office Three secret service headed by <a href="/wiki/Joachim_von_Ribbentrop" id="w">Joachim von Ribbentrop</a>, with probably more influence than the German ambassador <a href="/wiki/Edmund_von_Thermann" id="w">Edmund von Thermann</a>. He had met Perón in the 1930s, and had contacts with Generals <a href="/wiki/Juan_Pistarini" id="w">Juan Pistarini</a>, <a href="/wiki/Domingo_Mart%C3%ADnez" id="w">Domingo Martínez</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Domingo_Molina_G%C3%B3mez" id="w">Molina</a>. Ludwig Freude&#39;s house became the meeting center during the war for Nazis and Argentine military in favor of the <a href="/wiki/Axis_powers_of_World_War_II" id="w">Axis</a>. In 1943, he went with Perón to Europe to try to set an arms deal with Germany. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

Some of these refugees had important roles in Perón&#39;s Argentina, such as French collaborationist <a href="/wiki/Jacques_de_Mahieu" id="w">Jacques de Mahieu</a>, who became an ideologue of the Peronist movement, before becoming a mentor to a Roman Catholic nationalist youth group in the 1960s. Belgian collaborationist <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Daye" id="w">Pierre Daye</a> became editor of one of the official Peronist magazines. <a href="/wiki/Rodolfo_Freude" id="w">Rodolfo Freude</a>, son of Ludwig, became Perón&#39;s chief of presidential intelligence during his first term. Stojadinovitch founded in 1951 <i><a href="/wiki/El_Economista" id="w">El Economista</a></i>, which still carries his name on its masthead. The Croatian Roman Catholic priest <a href="/wiki/Krunoslav_Draganovi%C4%87" id="w">Krunoslav Draganović</a>, organizer of the San Girolamo ratline, had been deputed by Perón to help Nazis escape to Argentina, including <a href="/wiki/Ante_Pavelic" id="w">Ante Pavelic</a> <sup id="_ref-Time_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Time" title="">[9]</a></sup>.</p>

<a id="The_second_term_(1952-1955)" name="The_second_term_(1952-1955)"></a><h2>The second term (1952-1955)</h2>

<p>Perón won re-election in 1951.  During his second term Perón&#39;s administration faced serious economic problems.  Perón called employers and unions to a Productivity Congress with the aim of regulating social conflict through social dialogue, but the congress failed and a deal was not possible.</p>
<p>At the same time Perón signed a contract with an American oil company, <a href="/wiki/Standard_Oil_of_California" id="w">Standard Oil of California</a>, in May 1955, opening an economic policy of development with the help of foreign industrial investments.  The radical party leader, <a href="/wiki/Arturo_Frondizi" id="w">Arturo Frondizi</a>, considered it to be an anti-patriotic decision, but three years later he himself signed several contracts with foreign oil companies.</p>
<p>During the second term several terrorist acts were committed against civilian targets.  On <a href="/wiki/April_15" id="w">April 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a>, a terrorist group detonated two bombs in a public rally at <a href="/wiki/Plaza_de_Mayo" id="w">Plaza de Mayo</a>, killing 7 citizens and injuring 95.  On <a href="/wiki/June_15" id="w">June 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1955" id="w">1955</a>, a failed coup d&#39;état by anti-Peronists used navy aircraft to bomb Peronists at <a href="/wiki/Plaza_de_Mayo" id="w">Plaza de Mayo</a>, killing 364 citizens.  This is considered a prelude to the <a href="/wiki/Dirty_war" id="w">dirty war</a> in Argentina between 1976 and 1983.</p>
<p>In 1954, the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic Church</a>, which supported Perón&#39;s government up to that year, confronted Perón because of the enactment of the divorce law, among other reasons. Following the expulsion of two Catholic priests from the country, Perón was excommunicated from the Church by the Pope in <a href="/wiki/1955" id="w">1955</a>.  On <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1955" id="w">1955</a>, a nationalist Catholic group of both the Army and Navy, led by General <a href="/wiki/Eduardo_Lonardi" id="w">Eduardo Lonardi</a>, General <a href="/wiki/Pedro_Eugenio_Aramburu" id="w">Pedro E.

Argentina also faced problems of continued social and labour demands.  During those years poverty highly decreased, with rates  between 2% and 5% {{Fact}} in the first years of the 1960s (<a href="/wiki/INDEC" id="w">INDEC</a>).  Argentine painter <a href="/wiki/Antonio_Berni" id="w">Antonio Berni</a>&#39;s works reflected the social tragedies of these times.  In particular, Berni dealt with life hardships in the <i><a href="/wiki/Villas_miseria" id="w">villas miseria</a></i> (shanty towns) through his series Juanito Laguna, a slum child, and Ramona Montiel, a prostitute. During this time, Perón was allowed back into the church, the Pope&#39;s ban being lifted in <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>. </p>
<p>Perón sent his third wife, <a href="/wiki/Isabel_Mart%C3%ADnez_de_Per%C3%B3n" id="w">Isabel</a>, to Argentina in 1965, to meet political dissidents there.  She organized a reunion in the house of mayor Bernardo Alberte, Perón&#39;s delegate and sponsor of various left-wing Peronist movements such as the <a href="/wiki/General_Confederation_of_Labour_(Argentina)" id="w">CGT de los Argentinos</a>, a labor union federation.  Between 1968 and 1972, the CGT of the Argentines gathered opponents to <a href="/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Ongan%C3%ADa" id="w">Juan Carlos Onganía</a>&#39;s dictatorship, and would have an important role in the 1969 <i><a href="/wiki/Cordobazo" id="w">Cordobazo</a></i> insurrection.  During this travel, <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_L%C3%B3pez_Rega" id="w">José López Rega</a>, future founder of the <a href="/wiki/Anticommunist_Argentine_Alliance" id="w">Triple A</a> death squad, managed to win Isabel&#39;s trust, and then traveled to Spain. There, he worked first for Perón&#39;s security before becoming the couple&#39;s personal secretary.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Perón supported the more active unions, and maintained close links with the <a href="/wiki/Montoneros" id="w">Montoneros</a>, a left-wing Catholic Peronist group.  On <a href="/wiki/June_1" id="w">June 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a>, the Montoneros kidnapped and assassinated former anti-Peronist dictator <a href="/wiki/Pedro_Eugenio_Aramburu" id="w">Pedro Eugenio Aramburu</a>, in retaliation for the June 1956 Leon Suarez massacre and the execution of <a href="/wiki/Juan_Jos%C3%A9_Valle" id="w">Juan José Valle</a>, who had headed a Peronist uprising against the junta.</p>
<p>General <a href="/wiki/Alejandro_Lanusse" id="w">Alejandro Lanusse</a> took power in March 1971 and, faced with strong opposition and social conflicts, declared his intention to restore constitutional democracy by 1973.  From exile Perón supported both left-wing Peronists and right-wing Peronists. He supported as well conservative radicals such as <a href="/wiki/Ricardo_Balb%C3%ADn" id="w">Ricardo Balbín</a>, member of the <a href="/wiki/Radical_Civic_Union" id="w">Radical Civic Union</a> and an old opponent of Perón&#39;s, but also people such as left-wing Peronist <a href="/wiki/H%C3%A9ctor_Jos%C3%A9_C%C3%A1mpora" id="w">Héctor José Cámpora</a>, who also became his &#34;personal secretary.&#34; In 1971, he sent two letters to the film director <a href="/wiki/Octavio_Getino" id="w">Octavio Getino</a>, one congratulating him for his work of liberation carried out, along with <a href="/wiki/Fernando_Solanas" id="w">Fernando Solanas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gerardo_Vallejo_(film-maker)" id="w">Gerardo Vallejo</a>, in the <i><a href="/wiki/Grupo_Cine_Liberaci%C3%B3n" id="w">Grupo Cine Liberación</a></i>, and another concerning two <a href="/wiki/Film_documentaries" id="w">film documentaries</a> that were to be done with him (<i>La Revolución Justicialista</i> and <i>Actualización política y doctrinaria</i>) <sup id="_ref-Tercer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tercer" title="">[11]</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Finally, several members of the right-wing <a href="/wiki/Tacuara_Nationalist_Movement" id="w">Tacuara Nationalist Movement</a>, considered as the first Argentine guerrilla group, turned towards him.  Founded in the beginning of the 1960s, the Tacuaras were a fascist, anti-Semitic and anti-conformist group founded on the model of <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Antonio_Primo_de_Rivera" id="w">Primo de Rivera</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Falange" id="w">Falange</a>, who at first strongly opposed Peronism.  However, they split after the 1959 <a href="/wiki/Cuban_Revolution" id="w">Cuban Revolution</a> into three main different groups.  Opposed to the alliance with Peronism, Catholic priest Meinvielle retained the original ideological, and anti-Peronist, hard-line stance.  <a href="/wiki/Dardo_Cabo" id="w">Dardo Cabo</a>, to the contrary, founded the <a href="/wiki/Movimiento_Nueva_Argentina" id="w">Movimiento Nueva Argentina</a> (MNA, Movement New Argentina), officially launched on June 9, 1961, in commemoration of General <a href="/wiki/Juan_Jos%C3%A9_Valle" id="w">Juan José Valle</a>’s Peronist uprising in 1956.  The MNA became the ancestor of all modern Catholic nationalist groups in Argentina.  Finally, <a href="/wiki/Joe_Baxter" id="w">Joe Baxter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Nell" id="w">José Luis Nell</a> decided to join the Peronism movement, believing in its revolutionary capacities.  They created the <a href="/wiki/Movimiento_Nacionalista_Revolucionario_Tacuara" id="w">Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario Tacuara</a> (MNRT, Revolutionary Nationalist Tacuara Movement) which, without forsaking nationalism, cut away from the Church, the right-wing and anti-Semitism.  Baxter’s MNRT became progressively more left-wing and attracted by Marxism.  Many of the <a href="/wiki/Montoneros" id="w">Montoneros</a> and of the <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Revolutionary_Army_(Argentina)" id="w">ERP</a>’s leaders would come from this party.</p>
<a id="The_third_term_(1973-1974)" name="The_third_term_(1973-1974)"></a><h2>The third term (1973-1974)</h2>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_11" id="w">March 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1973" id="w">1973</a>, general elections were held.  Perón was banned from running, but a stand-in candidate, <a href="/wiki/H%C3%A9ctor_C%C3%A1mpora" id="w">Héctor Cámpora</a>,a left-wing Peronist and his personal secretary, was elected and took office on <a href="/wiki/May_25" id="w">May 25</a>.  On <a href="/wiki/June_20" id="w">June 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1973" id="w">1973</a>, Perón returned from Spain to end an 18-year exile. According to <i><a href="/wiki/Pagina_12" id="w">Pagina 12</a></i> newspaper, <a href="/wiki/Licio_Gelli" id="w">Licio Gelli</a>, headmaster of <a href="/wiki/Propaganda_Due" id="w">Propaganda Due</a>, had provided to Perón the <a href="/wiki/Alitalia" id="w">Alitalia</a> <a href="/wiki/Boeing" id="w">Boeing</a> plane to return to his native country <sup id="_ref-P12_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-P12" title="">[12]</a></sup>. Gelli was part of the committee supporting Perón, along with the young man <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Sa%C3%BAl_Menem" id="w">Carlos Saúl Menem</a> (future President of Argentina in the 1980s-90s) <sup id="_ref-P12_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-P12" title="">[12]</a></sup>. The Italian former Premier <a href="/wiki/Giulio_Andreotti" id="w">Giulio Andreotti</a> has recalled an encounter between Perón, his wife Isabel Martínez and Gelli, assuring that Perón had knelt before Licio Gelli to salute him <sup id="_ref-P12_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-P12" title="">[12]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>On the day of Perón&#39;s return, a crowd of left-wing Peronists (estimated at 3.5 million) had gathered at the Ezeiza airport in Buenos Aires to welcome and support him.  Perón came accompanied by Cámpora, whose first measure had been to grant <a href="/wiki/Amnesty" id="w">amnesty</a> to all <a href="/wiki/Political_prisoner" id="w">political prisoners</a> and to reestablish relations with Cuba, helping <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" id="w">Castro</a> break the <a href="/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba" id="w">US embargo</a>.  This, and his social policies, had also earned him the opposition of the right-wing Peronists, including the trade-unionist bureaucracy.</p>
<p>From Perón&#39;s tribune, camouflaged snipers, including members of the <a href="/wiki/Argentine_Anti-Communist_Alliance" id="w">Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance</a> (aka Triple A), opened fire on the crowd.  The left-wing Peronist Youth and the <a href="/wiki/Montoneros" id="w">Montoneros</a> had been trapped.  At least 13 people were killed (who have been identified), and 365 injured during this episode, which became known as the <a href="/wiki/1973_Ezeiza_massacre" id="w">Ezeiza massacre</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cámpora resigned in July 1973, paving the way for new elections, this time with Perón&#39;s participation.  Argentina had by this time reached a peak of instability, and Perón was viewed by many as the country&#39;s only hope for prosperity and salvation. </p>
<p>UCR&#39;s leader <a href="/wiki/Ricardo_Balb%C3%ADn" id="w">Ricardo Balbín</a> and Perón considered a Peronist-Radical joint government, but internal opposition in both parties made this impossible.  Perón&#39;s overwhelming victory (62% of the vote), returned him to the presidency.  In October 1973 he began his third term,  with <a href="/wiki/Isabel_Mart%C3%ADnez_de_Per%C3%B3n" id="w">Isabel</a>, his wife, as Vice President.</p>
<p>Perón&#39;s third term was marked by an escalating conflict between the Peronist left- and right-wing factions.  This turmoil was fueled primarily by Perón&#39;s growing ties with conservative Radical Party leader Ricardo Balbín, who the opposition led by <a href="/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Alfons%C3%ADn" id="w">Raúl Alfonsín</a> considered a right-wing radical.  The Montoneros began to become marginalized in the Peronist movement, mocked by Perón himself after the June 20, 1973 Ezeiza massacre. In his speech to the governors on 2 August 1973, Perón openly criticized these radical Argentine youths for what he considered a lack of political maturity. Shortly after Perón&#39;s attack on the revolutionary wing of Peronism, the Montoneros entered clandestinity.  Another guerrilla group, the Guevarist <a href="/wiki/ERP" id="w">ERP</a>, also opposed itself to the Peronist right-wing, and started engaging itself in <a href="/wiki/Armed_struggle" id="w">armed struggle</a>, attempting to create a <i><a href="/wiki/Foco" id="w">foco</a></i> in the province of <a href="/wiki/Tucuman" id="w">Tucuman</a>, the smallest province of Argentina located in the Northwest.  Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Lopez_Rega" id="w">José Lopez Rega</a>, personal secretary of Juan Perón and then of Isabel Perón, began targeting left-wing opponents.</p>
<p>Perón died of a heart attack on <a href="/wiki/July_1" id="w">July 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1974" id="w">1974</a> recommending that his wife, Isabel, rely on Balbín for support.  At the president&#39;s burial Balbín uttered a historic phrase, &#34;This old adversary bids farewell to a friend&#34;.</p>
<p>Isabel Perón succeeded her husband to the presidency, but proved thoroughly incapable of managing the country&#39;s mounting political and economic problems, the left-wing insurgency and the reaction of the extreme right.  Ignoring her late husband&#39;s advice, Isabel granted Balbín no role in her new government, instead granting broad powers to López Rega, who started engaging in a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Dirty_war" id="w">dirty war</a>&#34; against political opponents.</p>
<p>Isabel Perón&#39;s term was ended abruptly on <a href="/wiki/March_24" id="w">March 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a> by a military coup d&#39;état.  A <a href="/wiki/Military_junta" id="w">military junta</a>, headed by <a href="/wiki/Jorge_Rafael_Videla" id="w">General Jorge Videla</a> took control of the country, starting the self-styled <a href="/wiki/National_Reorganization_Process" id="w">National Reorganization Process</a>.  The junta combined a widespread persecution of political dissidents with the use of <a href="/wiki/State_terrorism" id="w">state terrorism</a>.  The final death toll rose to thousands (no less than 9,000, with human rights organizations claiming it was closer to 30,000).  Most of this number is accounted for by &#34;the <a href="/wiki/Forced_disappearance" id="w">disappeared</a>&#34; (<i>desaparecidos</i>), people kidnapped and executed without trial and without record.</p>
<a id="Per%C3%B3n's_corpse" name="Per%C3%B3n's_corpse"></a><h2>Perón&#39;s corpse</h2>
<p>Perón was buried in <a href="/wiki/La_Chacarita_Cemetery" id="w">La Chacarita Cemetery</a> in <a href="/wiki/Buenos_Aires" id="w">Buenos Aires</a>.  In 1987, his tomb was defaced, and the hands of his <a href="/wiki/Dead_body" id="w">corpse</a> (and some personal effects, such as his sword) were stolen.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/17_October" id="w">17 October</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> his body was moved to a new mausoleum in the Buenos Aires suburb of <a href="/wiki/San_Vicente%2C_Buenos_Aires" id="w">San Vicente</a>, his former summer residence, which was rebuilt as a museum.  A few people were injured in riots, as trade unions affiliated to the Peronist movement fought over access to the ceremony.  The police were able to contain the violence enough for the procession to move to the mausoleum.  The move of Perón&#39;s body offered the self-proclaimed illegitimate daughter of Perón the opportunity to obtain a DNA sample from his corpse which, she hoped, would prove that she was indeed his daughter.  The woman, Martha Holgado, 72, had been trying for 15 years to do this DNA analysis, which, in <a href="/wiki/November_2006" id="w">November 2006</a>, proved she was in fact, not his daughter.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
