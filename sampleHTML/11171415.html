<p><b>John Mylne</b> (1611&#8211;<a href="/wiki/24_December" id="w">24 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1667" id="w">1667</a>), sometimes known as &#34;John Mylne junior&#34;, or &#34;the Younger&#34;, was a <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland" id="w">Scottish</a> <a href="/wiki/Stonemasonry" id="w">master mason</a> and <a href="/wiki/Architect" id="w">architect</a>, who served as <a href="/wiki/Master_Mason_to_the_Crown_of_Scotland" id="w">Master Mason to the Crown of Scotland</a>. Born in <a href="/wiki/Perth%2C_Scotland" id="w">Perth</a>, he was the son of <a href="/wiki/John_Mylne_(d.1657)" id="w">John Mylne</a>, master mason, and Isobel Wilson.</p>
<p>Practising as a stonemason, he also took on the role of architect, designing as well as building his projects. He was one of the last masters of Scottish Renaissance architecture, before new styles were imported by his successors.<sup id="_ref-colvin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colvin" title="">[1]</a></sup> Alongside his professional career he also served as a soldier and politician. He married three times but had no surviving children.<sup id="_ref-colvin_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colvin" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Career" name="Career"></a><h2>Career</h2>
<p>Mylne learned his trade from his father, assisting him with projects including the sundial at <a href="/wiki/Holyrood_Palace" id="w">Holyrood Palace</a>. In 1633 Mylne was made a <a href="/wiki/Burgess" id="w">burgess</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_burgh" id="w">royal burgh</a> of <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" id="w">Edinburgh</a>, and was admitted to the Edinburgh lodge of masons, both on account of his father&#39;s position.<sup id="_ref-colvin_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colvin" title="">[1]</a></sup> He was first appointed to the town council in 1636, and in the same year was appointed master mason to the Crown, succeeding his father.<sup id="_ref-colvin_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colvin" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

His building projects were concentrated in Edinburgh, where, from 1637, he served as principal master mason to the city. For ten years he was involved in the construction of the <a href="/wiki/Tron_Kirk" id="w">Tron Kirk</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Mile" id="w">High Street</a>, which opened in 1647. The Tron was built to house the congregation of St Giles&#39;, which had been raised to cathedral status, and was laid out in the new T-plan form, with the pulpit in the centre, to suit reformed worship. The design was informed by contemporary Dutch architecture, and in particular by the work of Hendrick de Keyser, whose <i>Architectura Moderna</i> showcased his church designs in the Netherlands.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Mylne worked on the building with master wright John Scott, who was responsible for the timber work. The building was executed in a Dutch influenced style, with both <a href="/wiki/Gothic_architecture" id="w">gothic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Classical_order" id="w">classical</a> details. The church was not fully complete before Mylne&#39;s death, and was subsequently remodelled in the 18th century. A new spire was added in the 19th century following a fire, but Mylne&#39;s work can be seen in the body of the kirk. The carved <a href="/wiki/Tympanum_(architecture)" id="w">tympanum</a> was executed by Mylne&#39;s brother Alexander.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>From 1637 to 1649 he was also engaged on the design of Cowane&#39;s Hospital in <a href="/wiki/Stirling" id="w">Stirling</a>, which was executed by Stirling mason James Rynd. Mylne also carved the statue of its founder for the facade.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> In 1642, Mylne surveyed the crumbling remains of <a href="/wiki/Jedburgh_Abbey" id="w">Jedburgh Abbey</a>, for which services he was made a burgess of <a href="/wiki/Jedburgh" id="w">Jedburgh</a>. </p>
<p>From 1643 to 1659, he served as master mason for the construction of <a href="/wiki/George_Heriot%26%2339%3Bs_School" id="w">Heriot&#39;s Hospital</a> (now a school), succeeding <a href="/wiki/William_Aytoun" id="w">William Aytoun</a>. The building had been started in 1628 by <a href="/wiki/William_Wallace_(mason)" id="w">William Wallace</a>, and would not be finally completed until 1700; Mylne rebuilt one or two of the towers in 1648.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Also in 1648, Mylne was engaged to repair the crown steeple of <a href="/wiki/St._Giles%26%2339%3B_Cathedral" id="w">St. Giles&#39;</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Projects in the 1650s included the building of fortifications in <a href="/wiki/Leith" id="w">Leith</a>, and the addition of artillery emplacements to Edinburgh&#39;s town wall.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> He undertook a division of <a href="/wiki/Greyfriars_Kirk" id="w">Greyfriars Kirk</a>, to serve two congregations, and constructed a professor&#39;s house for <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" id="w">Edinburgh University</a>, which was demolished in the 18th century.<sup id="_ref-colvin_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colvin" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Following the <a href="/wiki/The_Restoration" id="w">Restoration</a> of <a href="/wiki/Charles_II_of_England" id="w">Charles II</a>, Mylne was reconfirmed in his post of Royal Master Mason, and was commissioned in 1663 to survey the upper floors of <a href="/wiki/Holyrood_Palace" id="w">Holyrood Palace</a>. The resulting plans are the earliest surviving architectural drawings from Scotland, and are held in the <a href="/wiki/Bodleian_Library" id="w">Bodleian Library</a> in Oxford.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> His design for the completion of the palace went unexecuted, with the work eventually being carried out by <a href="/wiki/William_Bruce_(architect)" id="w">Sir William Bruce</a> in the 1670s.<sup id="_ref-colvin_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colvin" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1666 John Mylne designed and was engaged to build Panmure House, near <a href="/wiki/Forfar" id="w">Forfar</a>, for the 2nd <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Panmure" id="w">Earl of Panmure</a>. After his death, the work was continued by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Nisbet" id="w">Alexander Nisbet</a>, possibly with the assistance of William Bruce.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> This house, demolished in 1950, resembled Heriot&#39;s Hospital and other Scottish 17th century buildings, rather than looking forward to the new classical styles which would be introduced by Bruce.<sup id="_ref-colvin_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colvin" title="">[1]</a></sup> During the <a href="/wiki/Second_Anglo-Dutch_War" id="w">Second Anglo-Dutch War</a> of 1665-1667, Mylne designed and built fortifications at <a href="/wiki/Lerwick" id="w">Lerwick</a>, which were later reconstructed as <a href="/wiki/Fort_Charlotte%2C_Shetland" id="w">Fort Charlotte</a>.<sup id="_ref-colvin_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colvin" title="">[1]</a></sup> He provided a design for <a href="/wiki/Linlithgow" id="w">Linlithgow</a>&#39;s tolbooth in 1667, but following his death another mason was sought, and a different design built. Another scheme was for Leslie House, carried out after his death by Robert Mylne, again with the advice of Bruce.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mylne&#39;s architectural works are in the Scottish Renaissance tradition, which combined <a href="/wiki/Gothic_architecture" id="w">gothic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Classical_architecture" id="w">classical</a> elements, together with <a href="/wiki/Mannerist" id="w">mannerist</a> ornament, often derived from imported pattern books.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Colvin describes Mylne as &#34;the leading master of the last phase of Scottish mannerism&#34;.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> By the 1660s, Mylne&#39;s work was becoming old-fashioned, as the European-inspired Palladian began to be imported by William Bruce.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Political_and_military_service" name="Political_and_military_service"></a><h2>Political and military service</h2>
<p>In 1640, Mylne joined the Scottish army which invaded northern England during the <a href="/wiki/Bishops%26%2339%3B_Wars" id="w">Second Bishop&#39;s War</a>. He was promoted in 1646 to Captain of Pioneers, and Master Gunner of Scotland.<sup id="_ref-colvin_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colvin" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>As well as serving on Edinburgh&#39;s town council from 1636 to 1664, Mylne played several other political roles in his life. In 1652, he served as part of a commission sent to the English Parliament in London, to discuss a possible Treaty of Union.<sup id="_ref-colvin_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colvin" title="">[1]</a></sup> From 1654 to 1659 he represented Edinburgh at the Convention of Royal Burghs, and in 1662 he was elected a burgh commissioner, a type of <a href="/wiki/Member_of_Parliament" id="w">Member of Parliament</a>, for Edinburgh, attending Charles II&#39;s first <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Scotland" id="w">Scottish parliament</a>.<sup id="_ref-colvin_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colvin" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

In 1667 Mylne was in discussions with the town of Perth for construction of a new market cross.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> However, he died at Edinburgh in December. He was buried in <a href="/wiki/Greyfriars_Kirkyard" id="w">Greyfriars Kirkyard</a>, Edinburgh, where a monument, erected by his nephew and apprentice <a href="/wiki/Robert_Mylne_(1633-1710)" id="w">Robert Mylne</a>, still stands. Another memorial was erected by the Freemasons at their meeting place, St. Mary&#39;s Chapel, although this former church was demolished in the 18th century.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> His portrait hangs in the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_National_Portrait_Gallery" id="w">Scottish National Portrait Gallery</a>. Robert Mylne succeeded him as master mason to the crown.</p>
