<p><b><i>Princes et princesses</i></b> (<a href="/wiki/2000_in_film" id="w">2000</a>) is a <a href="/wiki/Silhouette_animation" id="w">silhouette animation</a> by <a href="/wiki/Michel_Ocelot" id="w">Michel Ocelot</a>, his second feature-length film. It is a compilation of 6 of the 8 12-minute episodes of the series <i>Ciné si</i>, originally broadcast in 1989 and animated by <a href="/wiki/La_Fabrique" id="w">La Fabrique</a>. The feature film version was compiled in 1999 and went on general release in France on the 26th of January <a href="/wiki/2000_in_film" id="w">2000</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> it was translated and is released on DVD as part of the <a href="/wiki/Ghibli_Museum_Library" id="w">Ghibli Museum Library</a>.</p>
<p>Each episode/segment is a self-contained <a href="/wiki/Fairy_tale" id="w">fairy tale</a>, the only link being that the main characters are always played the same animated &#34;actors&#34;, having the same voices and, in most cases, the same physical appearance. Each tale is preceded by the actor-animators (a boy and girl, and old man and a talking bird) discussing, and often disagreeing about the story they are about to perform. The stories themselves, while all appearing to be traditional fairy tales,  are sometimes in highly unconventional settings (one seemingly influenced by <a href="/wiki/Yakov_Protazanov" id="w">Yakov Protazanov</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Aelita" id="w">Aelita</a></i>) and all have surprise endings, often giving the stories an unexpectedly <a href="/wiki/Post-modernism" id="w">post-modern</a> and <a href="/wiki/Feminism" id="w">feminist</a> moral.</p>

<a id="La_Princesse_des_diamants" name="La_Princesse_des_diamants"></a><h2>La Princesse des diamants</h2>
<p>It is said that somewhere, an enchanted princess lies captive in a secret palace - a palace you can be sure that you&#39;re getting close to if you find diamonds lying in the grass. But in order to free the princess from the curse placed upon her, one would have to find all one-hundred and eleven of the diamonds which make up her broken necklace. Many princes have attempted to break the spell, but all have disappeared without a trace.
