The <b>cougar</b> (<i>Puma concolor</i>), also <b>puma</b>, <b>mountain lion</b>, or <b>panther</b>, is a <a href="/wiki/Mammal" id="w">mammal</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Felidae" id="w">Felidae</a> family, native to the <a href="/wiki/Americas" id="w">Americas</a>. This large, solitary cat has the greatest <a href="/wiki/Range_(biology)" id="w">range</a> of any wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere,<sup id="_ref-diet_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-diet" title="">[1]</a></sup> extending from <a href="/wiki/Yukon" id="w">Yukon</a> in <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> to the southern <a href="/wiki/Andes" id="w">Andes</a> of <a href="/wiki/South_America" id="w">South America</a>. An adaptable, <a href="/wiki/Generalist_and_specialist_species" id="w">generalist</a> species, the cougar is found in every major <a href="/wiki/New_World" id="w">New World</a> <a href="/wiki/Habitat_(ecology)" id="w">habitat</a> type. It is the second heaviest cat in the New World, after the <a href="/wiki/Jaguar" id="w">jaguar</a>, and the fourth heaviest in the world, after the <a href="/wiki/Tiger" id="w">tiger</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lion" id="w">lion</a>, and jaguar, although it is most closely related to smaller felines.</p>
<p>A capable stalk-and-ambush <a href="/wiki/Predator" id="w">predator</a>, the cougar pursues a wide variety of prey. Primary food sources include <a href="/wiki/Ungulate" id="w">ungulates</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Deer" id="w">deer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bighorn_sheep" id="w">bighorn sheep</a>, as well as domestic cattle, horses, and sheep, particularly in the northern part of its range, but it hunts species as small as <a href="/wiki/Insect" id="w">insects</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rodents" id="w">rodents</a>. It prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking, but it can live in open areas. Cougars are known to kill at least one deer sized animal per week, more in warmer climates; unlike bears, they do not like spoiled meat.</p>
<p>The cougar is <a href="/wiki/Territory_(animal)" id="w">territorial</a> and persists at low population densities. Individual territory sizes depend on terrain, vegetation, and abundance of prey. While it is a large predator, it is not always the <a href="/wiki/Apex_predator" id="w">dominant species</a> in its range, as when it competes for prey with animals such as the <a href="/wiki/Gray_wolf" id="w">gray wolf</a>, <a href="/wiki/American_Black_Bear" id="w">black bear</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Grizzly_bear" id="w">grizzly bear</a>. It is a reclusive cat and usually avoids people. Attacks on humans remain rare, despite a recent increase in frequency.<sup id="_ref-Med_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Med" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Due to persecution following the <a href="/wiki/European_colonization_of_the_Americas" id="w">European colonization of the Americas</a>, and continuing human development of cougar habitat, populations have dropped in many parts of its historical range. In particular, the cougar was <a href="/wiki/Local_extinction" id="w">extirpated</a> in eastern <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a>, except an isolated <a href="/wiki/Florida_panther" id="w">sub-population in Florida</a>; the animal may be recolonizing parts of its former eastern territory. With its vast range, the cougar has dozens of names and various references in the mythology of the <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" id="w">indigenous peoples of the Americas</a> and in contemporary culture.</p>
<a id="Naming_and_etymology" name="Naming_and_etymology"></a><h1>Naming and etymology</h1>
<p>The cougar has over 40 names in English,{{Fact}} of which <i>puma</i> and <i>mountain lion</i> are popular. Other names include <b>catamount</b>, <b>panther</b>, <b>painter</b> because of it&#39;s black tail tip, and <b>mountain screamer</b>. In North America, &#34;panther&#34; is used most often to refer the <a href="/wiki/Florida_panther" id="w">Florida panther</a> sub-population. In South America, &#34;panther&#34; refers to both the spotted and black color morphs of the <a href="/wiki/Jaguar" id="w">jaguar</a>, while it is also broadly used to refer to the Old World <a href="/wiki/Leopard" id="w">leopard</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;Cougar&#34; is borrowed from the <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_language" id="w">Portuguese</a> <i>çuçuarana</i>, via <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>; the term was originally derived from the <a href="/wiki/Tupi_language" id="w">Tupi language</a>. A current form in Brazil is <i>suçuarana</i>. &#34;Puma&#34; comes, via <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" id="w">Spanish</a>, from the <a href="/wiki/Quechua_language" id="w">Quechua language</a> of Peru.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

In the latest <a href="/wiki/Genomic" id="w">genomic</a> study of Felidae, the common ancestor of today&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Leopardus" id="w">Leopardus</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Lynx" id="w">Lynx</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Puma_(genus)" id="w">Puma</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Prionailurus" id="w">Prionailurus</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Felis" id="w">Felis</a></i> lineages migrated across the <a href="/wiki/Bering_land_bridge" id="w">Bering land bridge</a> into the Americas approximately 8 to 8.5 million years (<a href="/wiki/Annum" id="w">Ma</a>) ago. The lineages subsequently diverged in that order.<sup id="_ref-Johnson2006_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Johnson2006" title="">[6]</a></sup> North American felids then invaded South America 3 Ma ago as part of the <a href="/wiki/Great_American_Interchange" id="w">Great American Interchange</a>, following formation of the <a href="/wiki/Isthmus_of_Panama" id="w">Isthmus of Panama</a>. The cougar was originally thought to belong in <i>Felis</i>, the genus which includes the <a href="/wiki/Domestic_cat" id="w">domestic cat</a>, but it is now placed in <i>Puma</i> along with the <a href="/wiki/Jaguarundi" id="w">jaguarundi</a>, a cat just a little more than a tenth its weight.</p>
<p>Studies have indicated that the cougar and jaguarundi are most closely related to the modern <a href="/wiki/Cheetah" id="w">cheetah</a> of Africa and western Asia,<sup id="_ref-Johnson2006_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Johnson2006" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Culver_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Culver" title="">[7]</a></sup> but the relationship is unresolved. It has been suggested that the cheetah lineage diverged from the <i>Puma</i> lineage in the Americas (see <a href="/wiki/American_cheetah" id="w">American cheetah</a>) and migrated back to Asia and Africa,<sup id="_ref-Johnson2006_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Johnson2006" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Culver_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Culver" title="">[7]</a></sup> while other research suggests the cheetah diverged in the Old World itself.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The outline of <a href="/wiki/Felinae" id="w">small feline</a> migration to the Americas is thus unclear.</p>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated a high level of genetic similarity among the North American cougar populations, suggesting that they are all fairly recent descendants of a small ancestral group. Culver <i>et al.</i> suggest that the original North American population of <i>Puma concolor</i> became extinct during the <a href="/wiki/New_World_Pleistocene_extinctions" id="w">Pleistocene extinctions</a> some 10,000 years ago, when other large mammals such as <i><a href="/wiki/Smilodon" id="w">Smilodon</a></i> also disappeared.

<p>Cougars are slender and agile cats. Adults stand about 60 to 80 cm (2.0 to 2.7 ft) tall at the shoulders. The length of adult males is around 2.4&#160;m (8&#160;ft) long nose to tail, with overall ranges between 1.5 and 2.75&#160;meters (5 and 9&#160;ft) nose to tail suggested for the species in general.<sup id="_ref-Texas_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Texas" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NY_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NY" title="">[12]</a></sup> Males have an average weight of about 53 to 72&#160;kilograms (115 to 160&#160;pounds). In rare cases, some may reach over 120&#160;kg (260&#160;lb). Female average weight is between 34 and 48&#160;kg (75 and 105&#160;lb).<sup id="_ref-CAP_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CAP" title="">[13]</a></sup> Cougar size is smallest close to the <a href="/wiki/Equator" id="w">equator</a>, and larger towards the <a href="/wiki/Polar_region" id="w">poles</a>.<sup id="_ref-diet_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-diet" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The head of the cat is round and the ears erect. Its powerful forequarters, neck, and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey. It has five retractable claws on its forepaws (one a <a href="/wiki/Dewclaw" id="w">dewclaw</a>) and four on its hind paws. The larger front feet and claws are adaptations to clutching prey.<sup id="_ref-WhosWho_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WhosWho" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cougars can be as large as jaguars, but are less muscled and powerful; where their ranges overlap, the cougar tends to be smaller than average. The cougar is on average heavier than the leopard. Despite its size, it is not typically classified among the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Big_cats" id="w">big cats</a>,&#34; as it cannot roar, lacking the specialized <a href="/wiki/Larynx" id="w">larynx</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hyoid" id="w">hyoid</a> apparatus of <i>Panthera</i>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Like domestic cats, cougars vocalize low-pitched hisses, growls, and purrs, as well as chirps and whistles. They are well known for their screams, referenced in some of its common names, although these may often be the misinterpreted calls of other animals.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cougar coloring is plain (hence the <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> <i>concolor</i>) but can vary greatly between individuals and even between siblings. The coat is typically tawny, but ranges to silvery-grey or reddish, with lighter patches on the under body including the jaws, chin, and throat. Infants are spotted and born with blue eyes and rings on their tails;<sup id="_ref-CAP_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CAP" title="">[13]</a></sup> juveniles are pale, and dark spots remain on their flanks.<sup id="_ref-NY_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NY" title="">[12]</a></sup> Despite anecdotes to the contrary, all-black coloring (<a href="/wiki/Melanism" id="w">melanism</a>) has never been documented in cougars.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The term &#34;<a href="/wiki/Black_panther" id="w">black panther</a>&#34; is used colloquially to refer to melanistic individuals of other species, particularly jaguars and leopards.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> </p>

<p>A successful <a href="/wiki/Generalist_and_specialist_species" id="w">generalist</a> <a href="/wiki/Predator" id="w">predator</a>, the cougar will eat any animal it can catch, from <a href="/wiki/Insect" id="w">insects</a> to large <a href="/wiki/Ungulates" id="w">ungulates</a>. Like all cats, it is an <a href="/wiki/Obligate_carnivore" id="w">obligate carnivore</a>, feeding only on meat. Its most important prey species are various deer species, particularly in North America; <a href="/wiki/Mule_deer" id="w">mule deer</a>, <a href="/wiki/White-tailed_deer" id="w">white-tailed deer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elk" id="w">elk</a>, and even the large <a href="/wiki/Moose" id="w">moose</a> are taken by the cat. Other species such as Bighorn Sheep, horses, and domestic livestock such as cattle and sheep are also primary food bases in many areas.  A survey of North America research found 68% of prey items were ungulates, especially deer. Only the Florida Panther showed variation, often preferring feral <a href="/wiki/Hog_(swine)" id="w">hogs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Armadillo" id="w">armadillos</a>.<sup id="_ref-diet_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-diet" title="">[1]</a></sup> Investigation in <a href="/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park" id="w">Yellowstone National Park</a> showed elk followed by mule deer were the cougar&#39;s primary targets; the prey base is shared with the park&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Gray_Wolf" id="w">gray wolves</a>, with whom the cougar competes for resources.<sup id="_ref-Yellowstone_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yellowstone" title="">[22]</a></sup> Another study on winter kills (November–April) in <a href="/wiki/Alberta" id="w">Alberta</a> showed that ungulates accounted for greater than 99% of the cougar diet. Learned, individual prey recognition was observed, as some cougars rarely killed <a href="/wiki/Bighorn_sheep" id="w">bighorn sheep</a>, while others relied heavily on the species.  The cougar also has conflicts with species such as Black Bear, as in many cases the bear will consume cougar kills, forcing the cougar to kill larger than normal numbers of prey animals.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Central and South American cougar range, the ratio of deer in the diet declines. Small to mid-size mammals are preferred, including large rodents such as the <a href="/wiki/Capybara" id="w">capybara</a>. Ungulates accounted for only 35% of prey items in one survey, approximately half that of North America.

<p>Though capable of sprinting, the cougar is typically an <a href="/wiki/Ambush_predator" id="w">ambush predator</a>. It stalks through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap onto the back of its prey and a suffocating neck bite. It has a flexible spine which aids its killing technique.</p>
<p>Kills are generally estimated at around one large ungulate every two weeks. The period shrinks for females raising young, and may be as short as one kill every three days when cubs are nearly mature at around 15 months.<sup id="_ref-CAP_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CAP" title="">[13]</a></sup> The cat drags a kill to a preferred spot, covers it with brush, and returns to feed over a period of days.

<p>Only females are involved in parenting. Female cougars are fiercely protective of their kittens, and have been seen to successfully fight off animals as large as grizzly bears in their defense. Litter size is between one and six kittens, typically two or three. Caves and other alcoves that offer protection are used as litter dens. Born blind, kittens are completely dependent on their mother at first, and begin to be weaned at around three months of age. As they grow, they begin to go out on forays with their mother, first visiting kill sites, and after six months beginning to hunt small prey on their own.<sup id="_ref-Utah_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Utah" title="">[25]</a></sup> Kitten survival rates are just over one per litter.<sup id="_ref-CAP_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CAP" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>Like almost all cats, the cougar is a solitary animal. Only mothers and kittens live in groups, with adults meeting only to mate. It is secretive and <a href="/wiki/Crepuscular" id="w">crepuscular</a>, being most active around dawn and dusk.</p>
<p>Estimates of territory sizes vary greatly.

<p>Because males disperse further than females and compete more directly for mates and territory, they are most likely to be involved in conflict.

<p>Aside from humans, no species preys upon mature cougars in the wild. The cat is not, however, the <a href="/wiki/Apex_predator" id="w">apex predator</a> throughout much of its range. In its northern range, the cougar interacts with other powerful predators such as the <a href="/wiki/Brown_bear" id="w">brown bear</a> and gray wolf (although a lone wolf poses little threat to an adult cougar). In the south, the cougar must compete with the larger jaguar.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park" id="w">Yellowstone National Park</a> ecosystem provides a fruitful microcosm to study inter-predator interaction in North America. Of the three large predators, the massive brown bear appears dominant, often although not always able to drive both the gray wolf and the cougar off their kills. One study found that brown or <a href="/wiki/American_Black_Bear" id="w">black bears</a> visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and <a href="/wiki/Glacier_National_Park" id="w">Glacier National Parks</a>, usurping just 10% of carcasses.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>The gray wolf and the cougar compete more directly for prey, especially in winter. While individually more powerful than the gray wolf, a solitary cougar may be dominated by the pack structure of the canines. Wolves can steal kills and occasionally kill the cat. One report describes a large pack of fourteen wolves killing a female cougar and her kittens. Conversely, lone wolves are at a disadvantage, and have been reported killed by cougars.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities, and disrupting the feline&#39;s behavior. Preliminary research in Yellowstone, for instance, has shown displacement of the cougar by wolves.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> One researcher in Oregon notes: &#34;When there is a pack around, cougars are not comfortable around their kills or raising kittens&#160;… A lot of times a big cougar will kill a wolf, but the pack phenomenon changes the table.&#34;<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> Both species, meanwhile, are capable of killing mid-sized predators such as <a href="/wiki/Bobcat" id="w">bobcats</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coyote" id="w">coyotes</a> and tend to suppress their numbers.<sup id="_ref-Yellowstone_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yellowstone" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the southern portion of its range, the cougar and jaguar share overlapping territory.<sup id="_ref-HAMDIG_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HAMDIG" title="">[43]</a></sup> The jaguar tends to take larger prey and the cougar smaller where they overlap, reducing the cougar&#39;s size.<sup id="_ref-diet_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-diet" title="">[1]</a></sup> Of the two felines, the cougar appears best able to exploit a broader prey niche and smaller prey.<sup id="_ref-foodhabits_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-foodhabits" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>As with any predator at or near the top of its <a href="/wiki/Food_chain" id="w">food chain</a>, the cougar impacts the population of prey species.

<p>Conservation threats to the species primarily includes depletion of its prey base.  As with any large efficient predator, cougar run the risk of damaging their prey base to the point where neither predator nor prey can sustain viable populations.  An excellent example of this and of cougar switching from one prey base to another is a well documented incident in the late 80&#39;s where the U. S Government gathered a large overpopulation of wild horses from the Nellis Air Force Range.  Wild horses were gathered with a helicopter near Stonewall Mountain, Nevada, east of Lida Junction along Hwy #95.  Many cougar had been using the huge horse population in the area for a prey base for many years.  1,600 head of wild horses were removed from this area in two weeks. Several months later virtually all of the Desert Bighorn Sheep in the area had been killed.  This is an excellent example of the wild horses being a &#34;buffer species&#34;, when the wild horse population disappeared, in less than two weeks the cougar turned to killing Bighorns.  This also explains how the lions came to be on the Sheep, Desert, and Pintwater Ranges of the Desert National Wildlife Range in the early 90&#39;s.  All of the Mule Deer in the huge area (larger than many States) and one of the largest concentrations of Desert Bighorn Sheep in the American West were extripated from the area in a couple short years by the cougar leading to a later crash of the cougar population in the area.  Sufficient range areas are critical to the sustainability of cougar populations. Research simulations have shown that the animal faces a low extinction risk in areas of 2200&#160;<a href="/wiki/Km%C2%B2" id="w">km²</a> (850&#160;sq&#160;mi) or more. As few as one to four new animals entering a population per decade markedly increases persistence, foregrounding the importance of habitat corridors.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>

A <b>pumapard</b> is a hybrid animal resulting from a union between a cougar and a <a href="/wiki/Leopard" id="w">leopard</a>. Three sets of these hybrids were bred in the late 1890s and early 1900s by Carl Hagenbeck at his animal park in <a href="/wiki/Hamburg" id="w">Hamburg</a>, Germany. Most did not reach adulthood. One of these was purchased in 1898 by <a href="/wiki/Berlin" id="w">Berlin</a> Zoo.  A similar hybrid in <a href="/wiki/Berlin" id="w">Berlin</a> Zoo purchased from Carl Hagenbeck was a cross between a male leopard and a female puma. Hamburg Zoo&#39;s specimen was the reverse pairing, the one in the black and white photo, fathered by a puma bred to an Indian leopardess. 
Whether born to a female Puma mated to a male Leopard, or to a male Puma mated to a female Leopard, pumapards inherit a form of dwarfism. Those reported grew to only half the size of the parents. They have a Puma-like long body (proportional to the limbs, but nevertheless shorter than either parent), but short legs. The coat is variously described as sandy, tawny or greyish with brown, chestnut or &#34;faded&#34; rosettes. {{Fact}}</p>

From <a href="/wiki/Eurocopter_Cougar" id="w">combat helicopters</a>, motor vehicles (see <a href="/wiki/Mercury_Cougar" id="w">Ford/Mercury Cougar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ford_Puma" id="w">Ford Puma</a>) to <a href="/wiki/Puma_AG" id="w">athletic shoes</a>, both &#34;Cougar&#34; and &#34;Puma&#34; are widely used as <a href="/wiki/Brand" id="w">brand names</a>. Various sports teams have also adopted the names, including the <a href="/wiki/Argentina_national_rugby_union_team" id="w">Argentina national rugby union team</a>. Many places, such as <a href="/wiki/Cougar_Mountain" id="w">Cougar Mountain</a>, are also named after their association with cougars.</p>
