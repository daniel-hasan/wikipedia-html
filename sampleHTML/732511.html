<b>Harisu</b> (<a href="/wiki/Hangul" id="w">Hangul</a>: 하리수; <a href="/wiki/Traditional_Chinese" id="w">Chinese</a>: 河莉秀) is the <a href="/wiki/Stage_name" id="w">stage name</a> of <b>Lee Kyung-eun</b> (born <b>Lee Kyung-yup</b>, <a href="/wiki/February_17" id="w">February 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a>), a <a href="/wiki/Transsexual" id="w">transsexual</a> <a href="/wiki/Pop_singer" id="w">pop singer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Model_(person)" id="w">model</a> and <a href="/wiki/Actress" id="w">actress</a> from <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" id="w">South Korea</a>.

She is noted for being South Korea&#39;s first <a href="/wiki/Transgender" id="w">transgender</a> entertainer, and in 2002 became only the second person in Korea to <a href="/wiki/Legal_aspects_of_transsexualism" id="w">legally change their gender</a>. Her stage name is an adaptation of the <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> phrase &#34;hot issue&#34;.</p>
<p>Harisu first gained public attention in 2001, after appearing in a <a href="/wiki/Television_commercial" id="w">television commercial</a> for DoDo <a href="/wiki/Cosmetics" id="w">cosmetics</a>. The commercial was a big success and ended up launching her career, allowing her to branch out into other fields such as music and acting. So far she has recorded five <a href="/wiki/Korean_language" id="w">Korean</a> musical <a href="/wiki/Album" id="w">albums</a>, switching <a href="/wiki/Music_genre" id="w">genres</a> between <a href="/wiki/Techno" id="w">techno</a> and <a href="/wiki/Contemporary_R%26amp%3BB" id="w">R&#38;B</a>, and her overseas releases have featured songs recorded in <a href="/wiki/Standard_Mandarin" id="w">Mandarin</a>. Her first major acting role was in the 2001 film <i><a href="/wiki/Yellow_Hair_2" id="w">Yellow Hair 2</a></i>, and since then her credits have included <i><a href="/wiki/Hi!_Honey" id="w">Hi!

Harisu made her acting debut in 1991—while still a boy—as a <a href="/wiki/Supporting_actor" id="w">supporting actor</a> in a high school <a href="/wiki/TV_drama" id="w">TV drama</a> series,<sup id="_ref-10 Minutes With Harisu_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10 Minutes With Harisu" title="">[11]</a></sup> and this was followed by other minor film and TV roles as an <a href="/wiki/Extra_(actor)" id="w">extra</a> during the 1990s.<sup id="_ref-South Korea Loosens Its Collar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-South Korea Loosens Its Collar" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Her big break came in early 2001, when she appeared in a <a href="/wiki/TV_commercial" id="w">TV commercial</a> for DoDo <a href="/wiki/Cosmetics" id="w">cosmetics</a>. The commercial hinted at the fact she is a transsexual, zooming in to reveal her <a href="/wiki/Adam%26%2339%3Bs_apple" id="w">Adam&#39;s apple</a> (although this was added digitally, since Harisu herself does not have a prominent Adam&#39;s apple).<sup id="_ref-Makeup Ad Features First Transsexual on TV_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Makeup Ad Features First Transsexual on TV" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Harisu Superstar_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Harisu Superstar" title="">[7]</a></sup> DoDo were initially cautious about using the commercial, and had been prepared to withdraw it if the response was negative, but it turned out to be a big success and quickly established her as a celebrity. As South Korea&#39;s first transgender entertainer, there was a great deal of media interest in Harisu, and she was routinely described as being &#34;more beautiful than a woman&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Harisu Superstar_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Harisu Superstar" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Harisu Redefines Gender Identity_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Harisu Redefines Gender Identity" title="">[13]</a></sup> Explaining her reasons for &#34;<a href="/wiki/Coming_out" id="w">coming out</a>&#34;, she said, &#34;I don&#39;t want to face people dishonestly.

It&#39;s better to make it clear from the start.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Harisu Redefines Gender Identity_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Harisu Redefines Gender Identity" title="">[13]</a></sup> In June 2001, Harisu was the subject of a <a href="/wiki/Television_documentary" id="w">television documentary</a> produced by <a href="/wiki/Korean_Broadcasting_System" id="w">KBS</a>, which covered her childhood, family relationships, and debut as an entertainer.<sup id="_ref-Ha Ri-Soo, Who Became a Woman: Story Behind_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ha Ri-Soo, Who Became a Woman: Story Behind" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Later that year she was cast in the film <i><a href="/wiki/Yellow_Hair_2" id="w">Yellow Hair 2</a></i>, her first leading role. In addition to contributing songs for the films <a href="/wiki/Film_soundtrack" id="w">soundtrack</a>, Harisu played a transsexual who goes on the run after the apparent death of a <a href="/wiki/Convenience_store" id="w">convenience store</a> owner. Regarding her decision to appear in the film, she said, &#34;I wanted to break the stereotype of transsexuals — the demureness and extreme weakness with which they are often portrayed.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Transsexual entertainer testing the boundaries of South Koreans' Confucian ideals_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Transsexual entertainer testing the boundaries of South Koreans' Confucian ideals" title="">[6]</a></sup> The film was released on <a href="/wiki/July_21" id="w">July 21</a>.</p>

In September, she entered the <a href="/wiki/K-pop" id="w">K-pop</a> music scene with her debut album, <i><a href="/wiki/Temptation_(Harisu_album)" id="w">Temptation</a></i>, a mix of <a href="/wiki/Techno" id="w">techno</a>-style <a href="/wiki/Pop_music" id="w">pop music</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ballad_(music)" id="w">slow ballads</a>, which peaked at number 32 on the MIAK (Music Industry Association of Korea) K-pop albums chart.<sup id="_ref-MIAK 09/01_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MIAK 09/01" title="">[14]</a></sup> She released her second album, <i><a href="/wiki/Liar_(Harisu_album)" id="w">Liar</a></i>, in October 2002, describing it as &#34;a high-energy dance record with a very upbeat rhythm.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Harisu Superstar_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Harisu Superstar" title="">[7]</a></sup> <i>Liar</i> became her biggest domestic chart success, reaching number 23 in its first month of release.<sup id="_ref-MIAK 10/02_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MIAK 10/02" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>In October 2003, Harisu made the decision to leave her management company, TTM Entertainment.

<p>In 2004, Harisu began to develop her career overseas, expressing frustration at being &#34;pigeon-holed&#34; as a transsexual in Korea. She starred in the <a href="/wiki/Taiwanese_drama" id="w">Taiwanese drama</a> series <i><a href="/wiki/Hi!_Honey" id="w">Hi!
