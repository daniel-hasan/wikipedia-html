<p>A <b>black hole</b> is a region of space in which the <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_field" id="w">gravitational field</a> is so powerful that nothing can escape after having fallen past the <a href="/wiki/Event_horizon" id="w">event horizon</a>.  The name comes from the fact that even <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" id="w">electromagnetic radiation</a> (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Light" id="w">light</a>) is unable to escape, rendering the interior invisible.  However, black holes can be detected if they interact with matter <i>outside</i> the event horizon, for example by drawing in gas from an orbiting star. The gas spirals inward, heating up to very high temperatures and emitting large amounts of <a href="/wiki/Radiation" id="w">radiation</a> in the process.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>While the idea of an object with <a href="/wiki/Gravity" id="w">gravity</a> strong enough to prevent light from escaping was proposed in the 18th century, black holes, as presently understood, are described by <a href="/wiki/Einstein" id="w">Einstein</a>&#39;s theory of <a href="/wiki/General_relativity" id="w">general relativity</a>, developed in <a href="/wiki/1916" id="w">1916</a>. This theory predicts that when a large enough amount of <a href="/wiki/Mass" id="w">mass</a> is present within a <a href="/wiki/Hoop_conjecture" id="w">sufficiently small region of space</a>, all <a href="/wiki/World_line" id="w">paths through space</a> are warped inwards towards the center of the <a href="/wiki/Volume" id="w">volume</a>, forcing all matter and radiation to fall inward.</p>
<p>While general relativity describes a black hole as a region of empty space with a pointlike <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_singularity" id="w">singularity</a> at the center and an event horizon at the outer edge, the description changes when the effects of <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" id="w">quantum mechanics</a> are taken into account.  Research on this subject indicates that, rather than holding captured matter forever, black holes may slowly leak a form of thermal energy called <a href="/wiki/Hawking_radiation" id="w">Hawking radiation</a>.<sup id="_ref-Nature248 _a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nature248 " title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-McDonald_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McDonald" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-HawkingPenrose_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HawkingPenrose" title="">[7]</a></sup>  However, the final, correct description of black holes, requiring a theory of <a href="/wiki/Quantum_gravity" id="w">quantum gravity</a>, is unknown.</p>
<a id="Sizes_of_black_holes" name="Sizes_of_black_holes"></a><h1>Sizes of black holes</h1>
<p>Black holes can have any mass. Since the gravitational force of a body on itself, at the surface of a body of any shape, increases in inverse  proportion to its characteristic lengthscale squared (as volume<sup>-2/3</sup> ), an object of any shape and mass that is sufficiently compressed will collapse under its own gravity and form a black hole. However, when black holes form naturally, only a few mass ranges are realistic.</p>
<p>Black  holes can be divided into several size categories:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole" id="w">Supermassive black holes</a> that contain millions to billions of times the <a href="/wiki/Solar_mass" id="w">mass of the sun</a> are believed to exist in the center of most galaxies, including our own <a href="/wiki/Milky_Way" id="w">Milky Way</a>. They are thought to be responsible for <a href="/wiki/Active_galactic_nuclei" id="w">active galactic nuclei</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Intermediate-mass_black_hole" id="w">Intermediate-mass black holes</a>, whose size is measured in thousands of solar masses, may exist. Intermediate-mass black holes have been proposed as a possible power source for <a href="/wiki/Ultra-luminous_X_ray_source" id="w">ultra-luminous X ray sources</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Stellar_black_hole" id="w">Stellar-mass black holes</a> have masses ranging from about 1.5-3.0 solar masses (the <a href="/wiki/Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff_limit" id="w">Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit</a>) to 15 solar masses. These black holes are created by the collapse of individual stars. Stars above about 20 solar masses may collapse to form black holes; the cores of lighter stars form <a href="/wiki/Neutron_star" id="w">neutron stars</a> or <a href="/wiki/White_dwarf" id="w">white dwarf</a> stars. In all cases some of the star&#39;s material is lost (blown away during the <a href="/wiki/Red_giant" id="w">red giant</a> stage for stars that turn into white dwarfs, or lost in a <a href="/wiki/Supernova" id="w">supernova</a> explosion for stars that turn into neutron stars or black holes).  </li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Micro_black_hole" id="w">Micro black holes</a>, which have masses at which the effects of <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" id="w">quantum mechanics</a> are expected to become very important. This is usually assumed to be near the <a href="/wiki/Planck_mass" id="w">Planck mass</a>. Alternatively, the term <b>micro black hole</b> or <b>mini black hole</b> may refer to any black hole with mass much less than that of a star. Black holes of this type have been proposed to have formed during the <a href="/wiki/Big_Bang" id="w">Big Bang</a> (<a href="/wiki/Primordial_black_hole" id="w">primordial black holes</a>), but no such holes have been detected <a href="/wiki/As_of_2007" id="w">as of 2007</a>.</li></ul>
<p>Astrophysicists expect to find stellar-mass and larger black holes, because a stellar mass black hole is formed by the <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_collapse" id="w">gravitational collapse</a> of a star of 20 or more solar masses at the end of its life, and can then act as a seed for the formation of a much larger black hole.</p>
<p>Micro black holes might be produced by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Big_Bang" id="w">Big Bang</a>, which produced pressures far larger than that of a <a href="/wiki/Supernova" id="w">supernova</a> and therefore sufficient to produce <a href="/wiki/Primordial_black_hole" id="w">primordial black holes</a> without needing the powerful gravity fields of collapsing large stars.</li>
<li>High-energy <a href="/wiki/Particle_accelerators" id="w">particle accelerators</a> such as the <a href="/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider" id="w">Large Hadron Collider</a> (LHC), if certain non-standard assumptions are correct (typically, an assumption of <a href="/wiki/Large_extra_dimension" id="w">large</a> <a href="/wiki/Extra_dimensions" id="w">extra dimensions</a>). However, any black holes produced in such a manner will evaporate practically instantaneously, thus <a href="/wiki/Black_hole#Micro black hole escaping from a particle accelerator" id="w">posing no danger to Earth</a>.</li></ul>
<a id="What_makes_it_impossible_to_escape_from_black_holes%3F" name="What_makes_it_impossible_to_escape_from_black_holes%3F"></a><h1> What makes it impossible to escape from black holes? </h1>

<p><a href="/wiki/General_relativity" id="w">General relativity</a> describes <a href="/wiki/Mass" id="w">mass</a> as changing the shape of <a href="/wiki/Spacetime" id="w">spacetime</a>, and the shape of spacetime as describing how matter moves through space.  For objects much less dense than black holes, this results in something similar to <a href="/wiki/Newton%26%2339%3Bs_law_of_universal_gravitation" id="w">Newton&#39;s laws of gravity</a>: objects with mass attract each other, but it&#39;s possible to define an <a href="/wiki/Escape_velocity" id="w">escape velocity</a> which allows a test object to leave the gravitational field of any large object. For objects as dense as black holes, this stops being the case. The effort required to leave the hole becomes infinite, with no escape velocity definable.</p>
<p>There are several ways of describing the situation that causes escape to be impossible.  The difference between these descriptions is how <a href="/wiki/Space" id="w">space</a> and <a href="/wiki/Time" id="w">time</a> coordinates are drawn on <a href="/wiki/Spacetime" id="w">spacetime</a> (the choice of coordinates depends on the choice of observation point and on additional definitions used).  One common description, based on the <a href="/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric" id="w">Schwarzschild description</a> of black holes, is to consider the time axis in spacetime to point inwards towards the center of the black hole once the horizon is crossed.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Under these conditions, falling further into the hole is as inevitable as moving forward in time. A related description is to consider the <a href="/wiki/Light_cone" id="w">future light cone</a> of a test object near the hole (all possible paths the object or anything emitted by it could take, limited by the <a href="/wiki/Speed_of_light" id="w">speed of light</a>). As the object approaches the <a href="/wiki/Event_horizon" id="w">event horizon</a> at the boundary of the black hole, the future light cone tilts inwards towards the horizon. When the test object passes the horizon, the cone tilts completely inward, and all possible paths lead into the hole.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Do_black__holes_have_%22no_hair%22%3F" name="Do_black__holes_have_%22no_hair%22%3F"></a><h1>Do black  holes have &#34;no hair&#34;?</h1>
<p>{{main}}
The <a href="/wiki/No_hair_theorem" id="w">&#34;No hair&#34; theorem</a> states that black holes have only 3 <i>independent</i> <i>internal</i> properties: mass, <a href="/wiki/Angular_momentum" id="w">angular momentum</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electric_charge" id="w">electric charge</a>. It is impossible to tell the difference between a black hole formed from a highly compressed mass of normal matter and one formed from, say, a highly compressed mass of <a href="/wiki/Anti-matter" id="w">anti-matter</a>; in other words, any information about infalling matter or energy is destroyed. This is the <a href="/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox" id="w">black hole information paradox</a>.</p>
<p>The theorem only works in some of the types of universe which the equations of <a href="/wiki/General_relativity" id="w">general relativity</a> allow, but this includes four-dimensional spacetimes with a zero or positive <a href="/wiki/Cosmological_constant" id="w">cosmological constant</a>, which describes our universe at the <a href="/wiki/Physics_in_the_Classical_Limit" id="w">classical level</a>.</p>
<a id="Types_of_black_holes" name="Types_of_black_holes"></a><h1>Types of black holes</h1>
<p>Despite the uncertainty about whether the &#34;No Hair&#34; theorem applies to our universe, astrophysicists currently classify black holes according to  their <a href="/wiki/Angular_momentum" id="w">angular momentum</a> (non-zero angular momentum means the black hole is rotating) and <a href="/wiki/Electric_charge" id="w">electric charge</a>:

<p>(All black holes have non-zero mass, so mass cannot be used for this type of &#34;yes&#34; / &#34;no&#34; classification)</p>
<p>Physicists do not expect that black holes with a significant electric charge will be formed in nature, because the <a href="/wiki/Coulomb%26%2339%3Bs_law" id="w">electromagnetic repulsion</a>, which resists the compression of an electrically charged mass, is about 40 orders of magnitude greater (about 10<sup>40</sup> times greater) than the gravitational attraction, which compresses the mass. So this article does not cover charged black holes in detail, but the <a href="/wiki/Reissner-Nordstr%C3%B6m_black_hole" id="w">Reissner-Nordström black hole</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kerr-Newman_metric" id="w">Kerr-Newman metric</a> articles provide more information.</p>
<p>On the other hand astrophysicists expect that almost all black holes will rotate, because the stars from which they are formed rotate. In fact most black holes are expected to spin very rapidly, because they retain most of the <a href="/wiki/Angular_momentum" id="w">angular momentum</a> of the stars from which they were formed, but concentrated into a much smaller radius. The same laws of angular momentum make skaters spin faster if they pull their arms closer to their bodies.</p>
<p>This article describes non-rotating, uncharged black holes first, because they are the simplest type.</p>
<a id="Major_features_of_non-rotating%2C_uncharged_black_holes" name="Major_features_of_non-rotating%2C_uncharged_black_holes"></a><h1>Major features of non-rotating, uncharged black holes</h1>
<a id="Event_horizon" name="Event_horizon"></a><h2>Event horizon</h2>
<p>This is the boundary of the region from which not even light can escape, but at the same time, light does not get sucked into the black hole. Stephen Hawking, in his book <i>A Brief History of Time,</i> describes the event horizon as &#34;the point of which light is just barely able to escape (I like to think of it as being chased by the police but just barely managing to stay one step away!).&#34;  Another way to think of this is that the light is running on a spacetime &#34;treadmill;&#34; the light is moving away from the black hole at the rate of <a href="/wiki/Speed_of_light" id="w">c</a>, but the spacetime is being sucked into the black hole at the same rate, so the two cancel each other out, much like a treadmill.  An observer at a safe distance would see a dull black sphere if the black hole was in a pure <a href="/wiki/Vacuum" id="w">vacuum</a> but in front of a light background, such as a bright <a href="/wiki/Nebula" id="w">nebula</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Event_horizon" id="w">event horizon</a> is not a solid surface, and does not obstruct or slow down matter or radiation that is traveling towards the region within the event horizon.</p>
<p>The event horizon is the defining feature of a black hole—it is black because no light or other radiation can escape from inside it. So the event horizon hides whatever happens inside it, and we can only calculate what happens by using the best theory available, which at present is <a href="/wiki/General_relativity" id="w">general relativity</a>.</p>
<p>The gravitational field outside the event horizon is identical to the field produced by any other spherically symmetric object of the same mass. The popular conception of black holes as &#34;sucking&#34; things in is false: objects can maintain an orbit around black holes indefinitely, provided they stay outside the photon sphere. (described below)</p>
<a id="Singularity_at_a_single_point" name="Singularity_at_a_single_point"></a><h2>Singularity at a single point</h2>
<p>According to general relativity, a black hole&#39;s mass is entirely compressed into a region with zero volume, which means its density and gravitational pull are <a href="/wiki/Infinity" id="w">infinite</a>, and so is the curvature of space-time that it causes. These infinite values cause most physical equations, including those  of general relativity, to stop working at the center of a black hole. So physicists call the zero-volume, infinitely dense region at the center of a black hole a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Gravitational_singularity" id="w">singularity</a>&#34;.</p>
<p>The singularity in a non-rotating, uncharged black hole is a point, in other words it has zero length, width, and height.</p>
<p>But there is an important uncertainty about this description: <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" id="w">quantum mechanics</a> is as well-supported by mathematics and experimental evidence as general relativity, and it does not allow objects to have zero size—so quantum mechanics says the center of a black hole is not a singularity but just a very large mass compressed into the smallest possible volume. At present we have no well-established <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_everything" id="w">theory</a> that combines quantum mechanics and general relativity; and the most promising candidate, <a href="/wiki/String_theory" id="w">string theory</a>, also does not allow objects to have zero size.</p>
<p>The rest of this article will follow the predictions of general relativity, because quantum mechanics deals with very small-scale (sub-atomic) phenomena and general relativity is the best theory we have  at present for explaining large-scale phenomena, such as the behavior of masses similar to or larger than stars.</p>
<a id="A_photon_sphere" name="A_photon_sphere"></a><h2>A photon sphere</h2>
<p>A non-rotating black hole&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Photon_sphere" id="w">photon sphere</a> is a spherical boundary of zero thickness such that photons moving along <a href="/wiki/Tangent#Geometry" id="w">tangents</a> to the sphere will be trapped in a circular orbit. For non-rotating black holes, the photon sphere has a radius 1.5 times that of the event horizon. This may give the impression that a black hole will accumulate a &#39;shell&#39; of captured photons, which will grow in density indefinitely, but this is not true. No photon is likely to stay in this orbit for long, for two reasons. First, it is likely to interact with any infalling matter in the vicinity (being absorbed or scattered). Second, the orbit is <a href="/wiki/Instability" id="w">dynamically unstable</a>; small deviations from a perfectly circular path will grow into larger deviations very quickly, causing the photon to either escape or fall into the hole.</p>
<p>Other extremely compact objects, such as <a href="/wiki/Neutron_stars" id="w">neutron stars</a>, can also have photon spheres.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> This follows from the fact that light &#34;captured&#34; by a photon sphere does not pass within the <a href="/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius" id="w">radius</a> that would form the event horizon if the object were a black hole of the same mass, and therefore its behavior does not depend on the presence of an event horizon.</p>

The gas nearest the event horizon forms a disk and, at this short range, the black hole&#39;s gravity is strong enough to compress the gas to a relatively high density. The pressure, friction and other mechanisms within the disk generate enormous energy (which causes the gases to turn into <a href="/wiki/Plasma_(physics)" id="w">plasma</a>)  - in fact they convert matter to energy more efficiently than the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fusion" id="w">nuclear fusion</a> processes that power stars.

<p>Rotating black holes share many of the features of non-rotating black holes—the inability of light or anything else to escape from within their event horizons, accretion disks, etc. But general relativity predicts that rapid rotation of a large mass produces further distortions of <a href="/wiki/Space-time" id="w">space-time</a>, in addition to those that a non-rotating large mass produces; and these additional effects make rotating black holes strikingly different from non-rotating ones.</p>
<a id="Ergosphere" name="Ergosphere"></a><h2>Ergosphere</h2>
<p>A large, ultra-dense rotating mass creates an effect called <a href="/wiki/Frame-dragging" id="w">frame-dragging</a>, so that <a href="/wiki/Space-time" id="w">space-time</a> is dragged around it in the direction of the rotation.</p>
<p>Rotating black holes have an <a href="/wiki/Ergosphere" id="w">ergosphere</a>, a region bounded by
</p>
<ul>
<li>on the outside, an <a href="/wiki/Oblate" id="w">oblate</a> spheroid, which coincides with the event horizon at the poles and is noticeably wider around the &#34;equator&#34;. This boundary is sometimes called the &#34;ergosurface&#34;, but it is just a boundary and has no more solidity than the event horizon. At points exactly on the ergosurface, space-time is dragged around at the speed of light.</li>
<li>on the inside, the outer event horizon.</li></ul>
<p>Within the ergosphere, space-time is dragged around faster than light—general relativity forbids material objects to travel faster than light (so does <a href="/wiki/Special_relativity" id="w">special relativity</a>), but allows regions of space-time to move faster than light relative to other regions of space-time.</p>
<p>Objects and radiation (including light) can stay in <i>orbit</i> within the ergosphere without falling to the center. But they cannot hover (remain stationary, as seen by an external observer), because that would require them to move backwards faster than light relative to their own regions of space-time, which are moving faster than light relative to an external observer.</p>
<p>Objects and radiation can also <i>escape</i> from the ergosphere. In fact the <a href="/wiki/Penrose_process" id="w">Penrose process</a> predicts that objects will sometimes fly out of the ergosphere, obtaining the energy for this by &#34;stealing&#34; some of the black hole&#39;s rotational energy. If a large total mass of objects escapes in this way, the black hole will spin more slowly and may even stop spinning eventually.</p>
<a id="Ring-shaped_singularity" name="Ring-shaped_singularity"></a><h2>Ring-shaped singularity</h2>
<p>General relativity predicts that a rotating black hole will have a <a href="/wiki/Ring_singularity" id="w">ring singularity</a> which lies in the plane of the &#34;equator&#34; and has zero width and thickness—but remember that <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" id="w">quantum mechanics</a> does not allow objects to have zero size in any dimension (their <a href="/wiki/Wavefunction" id="w">wavefunction</a> must spread), so general relativity&#39;s prediction is only the best idea we have until someone devises a <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_everything" id="w">theory</a> that combines general relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>

<a id="What_happens_when_something_falls_into_a_black_hole%3F" name="What_happens_when_something_falls_into_a_black_hole%3F"></a><h1>What happens when something falls into a black hole?</h1>
<p>This section describes what happens when something falls into a non-rotating, uncharged black hole. The effects of rotating and charged black holes are more complicated but the final result is much the same—the falling object is absorbed (unless <a href="/wiki/#Possibility of escaping from a rotating black hole" id="w">rotating black holes</a> really can act as <a href="/wiki/Wormholes" id="w">wormholes</a>).</p>
<a id="Spaghettification" name="Spaghettification"></a><h2>Spaghettification</h2>
<p>{{main}}
An object in any very strong gravitational field feels a <a href="/wiki/Tidal_force" id="w">tidal force</a> stretching it in the direction of the object generating the gravitational field. This is because the <a href="/wiki/Inverse_square_law" id="w">inverse square law</a> causes nearer parts of the stretched object to feel a stronger attraction than farther parts. Near black holes, the <a href="/wiki/Tidal_force" id="w">tidal force</a> is expected to be strong enough to deform any object falling into it, even atoms or composite nucleons; this is called <a href="/wiki/Spaghettification" id="w">spaghettification</a>.</p>
<p>The strength of the <a href="/wiki/Tidal_force" id="w">tidal force</a> depends on how gravitational attraction changes with distance, rather than on the absolute force being felt. This means that small black holes cause spaghettification while infalling objects are still outside their <a href="/wiki/Event_horizon" id="w">event horizons</a>, whereas objects falling into large, <a href="/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole" id="w">supermassive black holes</a> may not be deformed or otherwise feel excessively large forces before passing the event horizon.</p>
<a id="Before_the_falling_object_crosses_the_event_horizon" name="Before_the_falling_object_crosses_the_event_horizon"></a><h2>Before the falling object crosses the event horizon</h2>
<p>An object in a gravitational field experiences a slowing down of <a href="/wiki/Time" id="w">time</a>, called <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation" id="w">gravitational time dilation</a>, relative to observers outside the field. The outside observer will see that physical processes in the object, including clocks, appear to run slowly. As a test object approaches the event horizon, its gravitational time dilation (as measured by an observer far from the hole) would approach infinity.</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of a distant observer, an object falling into a black hole appears to slow down, approaching but never quite reaching the event horizon: and it appears to become redder and dimmer, because of the extreme <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_red_shift" id="w">gravitational red shift</a> caused by the gravity of the black hole. Eventually, the falling object becomes so dim that it can no longer be seen, at a point just before it reaches the event horizon. All of this is a consequence of time dilation: the object&#39;s movement is one of the processes that appear to run slower and slower, and the time dilation effect is more significant than the acceleration due to gravity; the <a href="/wiki/Frequency" id="w">frequency</a> of light from the object appears to decrease, making it look redder, because the light appears to complete fewer cycles per &#34;tick&#34; of the <i>observer&#39;s</i> clock; lower-frequency light has less energy and therefore appears dimmer, as well as redder.</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of the falling object, distant objects may appear either <a href="/wiki/Blue_shift" id="w">blue-shifted</a> or <a href="/wiki/Redshift" id="w">red-shifted</a>, depending on the falling object&#39;s trajectory. Light is blue-shifted by the gravity of the black hole, but is red-shifted by the velocity of the infalling object.</p>
<a id="As_the_object_passes_through_the_event_horizon" name="As_the_object_passes_through_the_event_horizon"></a><h2>As the object passes through the event horizon</h2>
<p>From the viewpoint of the falling object, nothing particularly special happens at the event horizon (apart from spaghettification due to <a href="/wiki/Tidal_force" id="w">tidal forces</a>, if the black hole has relatively low mass and therefore its event horizon has a small radius). An infalling object takes a finite <a href="/wiki/Proper_time" id="w">proper time</a> (i.e. measured by its own clock) to fall past the event horizon.</p>
<p>An outside observer, however, will never see an infalling object cross this surface. The object appears to halt just above the horizon, due to <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_redshift" id="w">gravitational redshift</a>, fading from view as its light is red-shifted and the rate at which it emits <a href="/wiki/Photon" id="w">photons</a> drops to approach zero. This doesn&#39;t mean that the object never crosses the horizon; instead, it means that light from the horizon-crossing event is delayed by a time that approaches infinity as the object approaches the horizon. The time of crossing depends on how the outside observer chooses to define space and time axes on <a href="/wiki/Spacetime" id="w">spacetime</a> near the horizon.</p>
<a id="Inside_the_event_horizon" name="Inside_the_event_horizon"></a><h2> Inside the event horizon </h2>
<p>The object reaches the singularity at the center within a finite amount of <a href="/wiki/Proper_time" id="w">proper time</a>, as measured by the falling object.  An observer on the falling object would continue to see objects outside the event horizon, <a href="/wiki/Blue_shift" id="w">blue-shifted</a> or <a href="/wiki/Redshift" id="w">red-shifted</a> depending on the falling object&#39;s trajectory.  Objects closer to the singularity aren&#39;t seen, as all paths light could take from objects farther in point inwards towards the singularity. </p>
<p>The amount of proper time a faller experiences below the event horizon depends upon where they started from rest, with the maximum being for someone who starts from rest at the event horizon.  A study in 2007 examined the effect of firing a rocket pack with the black hole, showing that this can only reduce the proper time of a person who starts from rest at the event horizon.  However, for anyone else, a judicious burst of the rocket can extend the lifetime of the faller, but overdoing it will again reduce the proper time experienced. However, this cannot prevent the inevitable collision with the central singularity.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Hitting_the_singularity" name="Hitting_the_singularity"></a><h2>Hitting the singularity</h2>
<p>As an infalling object approaches the singularity, <a href="/wiki/Tidal_force" id="w">tidal forces</a> acting on it approach infinity. All components of the object, including <a href="/wiki/Atom" id="w">atoms</a> and <a href="/wiki/Subatomic_particles" id="w">subatomic particles</a>, are torn away from each other before striking the singularity. At the singularity itself, effects are unknown; a theory of <a href="/wiki/Quantum_gravity" id="w">quantum gravity</a> is needed to accurately describe events near it. Regardless, as soon as an object passes within the hole&#39;s event horizon, it is lost to the outside universe. An observer far from the hole simply sees the hole&#39;s mass, charge, and angular momentum change slightly, to reflect the addition of the infalling object&#39;s matter. After the event horizon all is unknown. Anything that passes this point cannot be retrieved to study.</p>
<a id="Black_Hole_parameters" name="Black_Hole_parameters"></a><h1>Black Hole parameters</h1>
<p>Astrophysical black holes are characterized by two parameters: their mass and their angular momentum (or spin). The mass parameter <i>M</i> is equivalent to a characteristic length <i>GM/c<sup>2</sup>=1.48km(M/M<sub>0</sub>)</i> , or a characteristic timescale<i> GM/c³=4.93 x 10<sup>-6</sup>(M/M<sub>0</sub>)</i> , where <i>M<sub>0</sub></i> denotes the mass of the Sun. These scales, for example, give the order of magnitude of the radii and periods of near-hole orbits. The timescale also applies to the process in which a developing horizon settles into its asymptotically stationary form. For a stellar mass hole this is of order 10<sup>-5</sup> sec , while for a supermassive hole of 10<sup>8</sup> <i>M<sub>0</sub></i> , it is thousands of seconds. </p>
<p>For Schwarzschild holes, and approximately for Kerr holes, the horizon is at radius   
                      <i>R<sub>H</sub>=2GM/c²</i>.  
At the horizon the &#34;acceleration of gravity&#34; has no meaning, since a falling observer cannot stop at the horizon to be weighed. What is relevant at the horizon is the tidal stresses that stretch and distort the falling observer. This tidal stretching is given by the same expression, the gradient of the gravitational acceleration, as in Newtonian theory:
 <i>2GM/R<sub>H</sub><sup>3</sup>=c<sup>6</sup>/(4G<sup>2</sup>M<sup>2</sup>)</i> .</p>
<p>In the case of a solar mass black hole the tidal stress (acceleration per unit length) is enormous at the horizon, on the order of : <i> 3 x 10<sup>9</sup>(M/M<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup> sec<sup>-2</sup></i> : that is, a person would experience a differential gravitational field of about <i>10<sup>9</sup></i> Earth gravities, enough to rip apart ordinary materials. For a supermassive hole, by contrast, the tidal force at the horizon is smaller by a typical factor   10<sup>10-16</sup> and would be easily survivable. However, at the central singularity, deep inside the event horizon, the tidal stress is infinite.
In addition to its mass <i>M</i>, the Kerr spacetime is described with a spin parameter &#39;a&#39; defined by the dimensionless expression
       <i>a/M= cJ/GM<sup>2</sup></i>
where <i>J</i> is the angular momentum of the hole. For the Sun (based on surface rotation) this number is about 0.2, and is much larger for many stars. Since angular momentum is ubiquitous in astrophysics, and since it is expected to be approximately conserved during collapse and black hole formation, astrophysical holes are expected to have significant values of <i>a/M</i> , from several tenths up to and approaching unity. </p>
<p>The value of <i>a/M</i> can be unity (an &#34;extreme&#34; Kerr hole), but it cannot be greater than unity. In the mathematics of general relativity, exceeding this limit replaces the event horizon with an inner boundary on the spacetime where tidal forces become infinite. Because this singularity is &#34;visible&#34; to observers, rather than hidden behind a horizon, as in a black hole, it is called a naked singularity. Toy models and heuristic arguments suggest that as <i>a/M</i> approaches unity it becomes more and more difficult to add angular momentum. The conjecture that such mechanisms will always keep <i>a/M</i> below unity is called cosmic censorship. </p>
<p>The inclusion of angular momentum changes details of the description of the horizon, so that, for example, the horizon area becomes 
          <i>Horizon area= 4πG<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>4</sup>[{M+(M²-a²)<sup>1/2</sup>}²+a²]</i></p> 
<p>This modification of the Schwarzschild (<i>a</i>=0) result is not significant until <i>a/M</i> becomes very close to unity. For this reason, good estimates can be made in many astrophysical scenarios with <i>a</i> ignored.</p>

<a id="Formation_of_stellar-mass_black_holes" name="Formation_of_stellar-mass_black_holes"></a><h2>Formation of stellar-mass black holes</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Stellar-mass_black_hole" id="w">Stellar-mass black holes</a> are formed in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>As a direct result of the <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_collapse" id="w">gravitational collapse</a> of a star.</li>
<li>By collisions between neutron stars.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Although neutron stars are fairly common, collisions appear to be very rare. Neutron stars are also formed by gravitational collapse, which is therefore ultimately responsible for all stellar-mass black holes.</li></ul>
<p><a href="/wiki/Stars" id="w">Stars</a> undergo <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_collapse" id="w">gravitational collapse</a> when they can no longer resist the pressure of their own gravity. This usually occurs either because a star has too little <a href="/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis" id="w">&#34;fuel&#34;</a> left to maintain its temperature, or because a star which would have been stable receives a lot of extra matter in a way which does not raise its core temperature. In either case the star&#39;s temperature is no longer high enough to prevent it from collapsing under its own weight (the <a href="/wiki/Ideal_gas_law" id="w">ideal gas law</a> explains the connection between pressure, temperature, and volume).</p>
<p>The collapse transforms the matter in the star&#39;s core into a <a href="/wiki/Degenerate_matter" id="w">denser state</a> which forms one of the types of <a href="/wiki/Compact_star" id="w">compact star</a>. Which type of compact star is formed depends on the mass of the remnant - the matter left over after changes triggered by the collapse (such as <a href="/wiki/Supernova" id="w">supernova</a> or pulsations leading to a <a href="/wiki/Planetary_nebula" id="w">planetary nebula</a>)  have blown away the outer layers. Note that this can be substantially less than the original star - remnants exceeding 5 solar masses are produced by stars which were over 20 solar masses before the collapse.</p>
<p>Only the largest remnants, those exceeding a particular limit (the <a href="/wiki/Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff_limit" id="w">Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit</a>, not to be confused with the <a href="/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit" id="w">Chandrasekhar limit</a>), generate enough pressure to produce black holes, because black holes are the most radically transformed state of matter known to physics, and the force which resists this level of compression, <a href="/wiki/Neutron_degeneracy_pressure" id="w">neutron degeneracy pressure</a>, is extremely strong. But any remnant this size will never be able to stop collapsing, and when its outer radius falls below its <a href="/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius" id="w">Schwarzschild radius</a>, the transition to black hole is complete. </p>
<p>The collapse process for stars producing remnants this size releases energy which usually produces a <a href="/wiki/Supernova" id="w">supernova</a>, blowing  the star&#39;s outer layers into space so that they form a spectacular <a href="/wiki/Nebula" id="w">nebula</a> (this sort of nebula is called a <a href="/wiki/Supernova_remnant" id="w">supernova remnant</a>). But the supernova is a side-effect and does not directly contribute to producing the black hole (or other type of compact star). For example a few <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray_bursts" id="w">gamma ray bursts</a> were expected to be followed by evidence of supernovae but this evidence did not appear.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>   One possible explanation is that some very large stars can form black holes fast enough to swallow the supernova blast wave before it can reach the surface of the star.</p>
<a id="Formation_of_larger_black_holes" name="Formation_of_larger_black_holes"></a><h2>Formation of larger black holes</h2>
<p>There are two main ways in which black holes of larger than stellar mass can be formed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Stellar-mass black holes may act as &#34;seeds&#34; which grow by absorbing mass from interstellar gas and dust, stars and planets or smaller black holes.</li>
<li>Star clusters of large total mass may be merged into single bodies by their members&#39; gravitational attraction. This will usually produce a <a href="/wiki/Supergiant" id="w">supergiant</a> or <a href="/wiki/Hypergiant" id="w">hypergiant</a> star which runs short of <a href="/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis" id="w">&#34;fuel&#34;</a> in a few million years and then undergoes gravitational collapse, produces a supernova or <a href="/wiki/Hypernova" id="w">hypernova</a> and spends the rest of its existence as a black hole.</li></ul>
<a id="Formation_of_smaller_black_holes" name="Formation_of_smaller_black_holes"></a><h2>Formation of smaller black holes</h2>
<p>No known process currently active in the universe can form black holes of less than stellar mass. This is because all present known black hole formation is through gravitational collapse, and the smallest mass which can collapse to form a black hole produces a hole approximately 1.5-3.0 times the mass of the <a href="/wiki/Sun" id="w">sun</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff_limit" id="w">Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit</a>). Smaller masses collapse to form <a href="/wiki/White_dwarf" id="w">white dwarf</a> stars or <a href="/wiki/Neutron_star" id="w">neutron stars</a>.</p>
<p>There are still a few ways in which smaller black holes might be formed, or might have formed in the past.</p>
<a id="Evaporation_of_larger_black_holes" name="Evaporation_of_larger_black_holes"></a><h4> Evaporation of larger black holes </h4>

<p>Larger black holes <a href="/wiki/#Evaporation" id="w">evaporate</a>. If the initial mass of the hole was stellar mass, the time required for it to lose most of its mass via <a href="/wiki/Hawking_evaporation" id="w">Hawking evaporation</a> is much longer than the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_the_universe" id="w">age of the universe</a>, so small black holes are not expected to have formed by this method yet.</p>
<a id="Big_Bang" name="Big_Bang"></a><h4> Big Bang </h4>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Big_Bang" id="w">Big Bang</a> produced sufficient pressure to form smaller black holes without the need for anything resembling a star. None of these hypothesized <a href="/wiki/Primordial_black_hole" id="w">primordial black holes</a> have been detected.</p>
<a id="Particle_accelerators" name="Particle_accelerators"></a><h4> Particle accelerators </h4>

<p>In principle, a sufficiently energetic collision within a very powerful <a href="/wiki/Particle_accelerator" id="w">Particle accelerator</a> could produce a <a href="/wiki/Micro_black_hole" id="w">micro black hole</a>. In practice, this is expected to require energies comparable to the <a href="/wiki/Planck_energy" id="w">Planck energy</a>, which is vastly beyond the capability of any present, planned, or expected future particle accelerator to produce. Some speculative models allow the formation of black holes at much lower energies. This would allow production of extremely short-lived black holes in terrestrial particle accelerators. No evidence of this type of black hole production has been presented <a href="/wiki/As_of_2007" id="w">as of 2007</a>.  </p>
<p>See <a href="/wiki/Black_hole#Micro black hole escaping from a particle accelerator" id="w">Micro black hole escaping from a particle accelerator</a></p>
<a id="Evaporation" name="Evaporation"></a><h2>Evaporation</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Hawking_radiation" id="w">Hawking radiation</a> is a theoretical process by which black holes can evaporate into nothing. As there is no experimental evidence to corroborate it and there are still some major questions about the theoretical basis of the process, there is still debate about whether Hawking radiation can enable black holes to evaporate.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" id="w">Quantum mechanics</a> says that even the purest vacuum is not completely empty but is instead a &#34;sea&#34; of energy (known as <a href="/wiki/Zero-point_energy" id="w">zero-point energy</a>) which has wave-like <a href="/wiki/Fluctuations" id="w">fluctuations</a>. We cannot observe this &#34;sea&#34; of energy directly because there is no lower energy level with which we can compare it. The Heisenberg <a href="/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" id="w">uncertainty principle</a> dictates that it is impossible to know the exact value of the mass-energy and position pairings. The <a href="/wiki/Vacuum_fluctuations" id="w">fluctuations</a> in this sea produce pairs of particles in which one is made of normal matter and the other is the corresponding <a href="/wiki/Antiparticle" id="w">antiparticle</a> (<a href="/wiki/Special_relativity" id="w">special relativity</a> proves <a href="/wiki/Mass-energy_equivalence" id="w">mass-energy equivalence</a>, i.e. that mass can be converted into energy and <i>vice versa</i>). Normally each would soon meet another instance of its antiparticle and the two would be totally converted into energy, restoring the overall matter-energy balance as it was before the pair of particles was created. The Hawking radiation theory suggests that, if such a pair of particles is created just outside the event horizon of a black hole, one of the two particles may fall into the black hole while the other escapes, because the two particles move in slightly different directions after their creation. From the point of view of an outside observer, the black hole has just emitted a particle and therefore the black hole has lost a minute amount of its mass.</p>
<p>If the Hawking radiation theory is correct, only the very smallest black holes are likely to evaporate in this way. For example a black hole with the mass of our Moon would gain as much energy (and therefore mass - <a href="/wiki/Mass-energy_equivalence" id="w">mass-energy equivalence</a> again) from <a href="/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" id="w">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> as it emits by Hawking radiation, and larger black holes will gain more energy (and mass) than they emit. To put this in perspective, the smallest black hole which can be created naturally at present is about 5 times the mass of our sun, so most black holes have much greater mass than our Moon.</p>
<p>Over time the cosmic microwave background radiation becomes weaker. Eventually it will be weak enough so that more Hawking radiation will be emitted than the energy of the background radiation being absorbed by the black hole. Through this process, even the largest black holes will eventually evaporate. However, this process may take nearly a <a href="/wiki/Googol" id="w">googol</a> years to complete.</p>

<p>But strong, irregular emissions of <a href="/wiki/X-ray" id="w">X-rays</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray" id="w">gamma rays</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" id="w">electromagnetic radiation</a> can help to prove that a massive, ultra-dense object is <i>not</i> a black hole, so that &#34;black hole hunters&#34; can move on to some other object. Neutron stars and other very dense stars have surfaces, and matter colliding with the surface at a high percentage of the speed of light will produce intense flares of radiation at irregular intervals. Black holes have no material surface, so the absence of irregular flares round a massive, ultra-dense object suggests that there is a good chance of finding a black hole there.</p>
<p>Intense but one-time <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray_burst" id="w">gamma ray bursts</a> (GRBs) may signal the birth of &#34;new&#34; black holes, because astrophysicists think that GRBs are caused either by the <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_collapse" id="w">gravitational collapse</a> of giant stars<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> or by collisions between neutron stars,<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> and both types of event involve sufficient mass and pressure to produce black holes.

<p>A <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_lens" id="w">gravitational lens</a> is formed when the light from a very distant, bright source (such as a <a href="/wiki/Quasar" id="w">quasar</a>) is &#34;bent&#34; around a massive object (such as a black hole) between the source object and the observer. The process is known as <b>gravitational lensing</b>, and is one of the <a href="/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity" id="w">predictions</a> of <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" id="w">Albert Einstein</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/General_relativity" id="w">general theory of relativity</a>.

<p>A source image behind the lens may appear as multiple images to the observer. In cases where the source, massive lensing object, and the observer lie in a straight line, the source will appear as a ring behind the massive object.</p>
<p>Gravitational lensing can be caused by objects other than black holes, because any very strong gravitational field will bend light rays. Some of these multiple-image effects are probably produced by distant galaxies.</p>
<a id="Objects_orbiting_possible_black_holes" name="Objects_orbiting_possible_black_holes"></a><h2>Objects orbiting possible black holes</h2>
<p>{{See also}}
Some large celestial objects are almost certainly orbiting around black holes, and the principles behind this conclusion are surprisingly simple if we consider a circular orbit first (although all known closed astronomical orbits are <a href="/wiki/Elliptical" id="w">elliptical</a>):
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Radius" id="w">radius</a> of the central object round which the observed object is orbiting must be less than the radius of the orbit, otherwise the two objects would collide.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Orbital_period" id="w">orbital period</a> and the radius of the orbit make it easy to calculate the <a href="/wiki/Centrifugal_force" id="w">centrifugal force</a> created by the orbiting object. Strictly speaking, the centrifugal force also depends on the orbiting object&#39;s mass, but the next two steps show why we can get away with pretending this is a fixed number: <i>e.g.,</i> 1.</li>
<li>The gravitational attraction between the central object and the orbiting object must be exactly equal to the centrifugal force, otherwise the orbiting body would either spiral into the central object or drift away.</li>
<li>The required gravitational attraction depends on the mass of the central object, the mass of the orbiting object, and the radius of the orbit. But we can simplify the calculation of both the centrifugal force and the gravitational attraction by pretending that the mass of the orbiting object is the <i>same</i> fixed number: <i>e.g.,</i> 1. This makes it very easy to calculate the mass of the central object.</li>
<li>If the <a href="/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius" id="w">Schwarzschild radius</a> for a body with the mass of the central object is greater than the maximum radius of the central object, the central object <i>must</i> be a black hole whose <a href="/wiki/Event_horizon" id="w">event horizon</a>&#39;s radius is equal to the Schwarzschild radius.</li></ul>
<p>Unfortunately, since the time of <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Kepler" id="w">Johannes Kepler</a>, astronomers have had to deal with the complications of real astronomy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Astronomical orbits are <a href="/wiki/Elliptical" id="w">elliptical</a>. This complicates the calculation of the centrifugal force, the gravitational attraction, and the maximum radius of the central body. But Kepler could handle this without needing a computer.</li>
<li>The orbital periods in this type of situation are several years, so several years&#39; worth of observations are needed to determine the actual orbit accurately. The &#34;possibly a black hole&#34; indicators (accretion disks, gas jets, radiation emissions, etc.) help &#34;black hole hunters&#34; to decide which orbits are worth observing for such long periods.</li>
<li>If there are other large bodies within a few light years, their gravity fields will <a href="/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)" id="w">perturb</a> the orbit. Adjusting the calculations to filter out the effects of perturbation can be difficult, but astronomers are used to doing it.</li></ul>

<p>According to the American Astronomical Society, every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. The black hole’s mass is proportional to the mass of the host galaxy, suggesting that the two are linked very closely. The Hubble and ground-based telescopes in Hawaii were used in a large survey of galaxies.</p>
<p>For decades, astronomers have used the term &#34;<a href="/wiki/Active_galaxy" id="w">active galaxy</a>&#34; to describe galaxies with unusual characteristics, such as unusual <a href="/wiki/Spectral_line" id="w">spectral line</a> emission and very strong <a href="/wiki/Radio" id="w">radio</a> emission.<sup id="_ref-krolik1999_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-krolik1999" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-sparkegallagher2000_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sparkegallagher2000" title="">[25]</a></sup>  However, theoretical and observational studies have shown that the <a href="/wiki/Active_galactic_nuclei" id="w">active galactic nuclei</a> (AGN) in these galaxies may contain <a href="/wiki/Supermassive_black_holes" id="w">supermassive black holes</a>.<sup id="_ref-krolik1999_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-krolik1999" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-sparkegallagher2000_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sparkegallagher2000" title="">[25]</a></sup>  The models of these AGN consist of a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times more massive than the <a href="/wiki/Sun" id="w">Sun</a>; a disk of <a href="/wiki/Interstellar_gas" id="w">gas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Interstellar_dust" id="w">dust</a> called an <a href="/wiki/Accretion_disk" id="w">accretion disk</a>; and two <a href="/wiki/Relativistic_jet" id="w">jets</a> that are perpendicular to the accretion disk.<sup id="_ref-sparkegallagher2000_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sparkegallagher2000" title="">[25]</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In November 2004 a team of astronomers reported the discovery of the first well-confirmed <a href="/wiki/Intermediate-mass_black_hole" id="w">intermediate-mass black hole</a> in our Galaxy, orbiting three light-years from Sagittarius A*.

These black hole analogs are not the same as gravitational black holes, but they are
vital testing grounds for quantum theories of gravity.</p>
<p>They act like black holes because of the <a href="/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence" id="w">correspondence</a> between the theory of the strong nuclear force, which has nothing to do with gravity, and the quantum theory of gravity. They are similar because both are described by string theory.  So the formation and disintegration of a <a href="/wiki/Quark-gluon_plasma" id="w">fireball</a> in quark gluon plasma can be interpreted in black hole language. The fireball at RHIC is a phenomenon which is closely analogous to a black hole, and many of its physical properties can be correctly predicted using this analogy.

<p>The Newtonian conceptions of Michell and Laplace are often referred to as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Dark_star" id="w">dark stars</a>&#34; to distinguish them from the &#34;black holes&#34; of general relativity.
</p><a id="Newtonian_theories_(before_Einstein)" name="Newtonian_theories_(before_Einstein)"></a><h2>Newtonian theories (before Einstein)</h2>
<p>The concept of a body so massive that even light could not escape was put forward by the <a href="/wiki/Geologist" id="w">geologist</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Michell" id="w">John Michell</a> in a letter written to <a href="/wiki/Henry_Cavendish" id="w">Henry Cavendish</a> in 1783 and published by the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society" id="w">Royal Society</a>.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup>

<p>This assumes that light is influenced by gravity in the same way as massive objects.</p>
<p>In 1796, the mathematician <a href="/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace" id="w">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a> promoted the same idea in the first and second editions of his book <i>Exposition du système du Monde</i> (it was removed from later editions).</p>
<p>The idea of black holes was largely ignored in the nineteenth century, since light was then thought to be a massless wave and therefore not influenced by gravity. Unlike a modern black hole, the object behind the horizon is assumed to be stable against collapse.</p>
<a id="Theories_based_on_Einstein's_general_relativity" name="Theories_based_on_Einstein's_general_relativity"></a><h2>Theories based on Einstein&#39;s general relativity</h2>
<p>In 1915, <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" id="w">Albert Einstein</a> developed the theory of gravity called <a href="/wiki/General_relativity" id="w">general relativity</a>, having earlier shown that gravity does influence light (although light has zero <a href="/wiki/Rest_mass" id="w">rest mass</a>, its path follows any curvature of <a href="/wiki/Space-time" id="w">space-time</a>, and gravity is curvature of space-time). A few months later, <a href="/wiki/Karl_Schwarzschild" id="w">Karl Schwarzschild</a> gave the <a href="/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric" id="w">solution</a> for the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass,<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> showing that a black hole could theoretically exist. The <a href="/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius" id="w">Schwarzschild radius</a> is now known to be the radius of the <a href="/wiki/Event_horizon" id="w">event horizon</a> of a non-rotating black hole, but this was not well understood at that time, for example Schwarzschild himself thought it was not physical. Johannes Droste, a student of <a href="/wiki/Hendrik_Lorentz" id="w">Lorentz</a>, independently gave the same solution for the point mass a few months after Schwarzschild and wrote more extensively about its properties.</p>
<p>In 1930, the <a href="/wiki/Astrophysicist" id="w">astrophysicist</a> <a href="/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar" id="w">Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar</a> argued that, according to <a href="/wiki/Special_relativity" id="w">special relativity</a>, a non-rotating body above 1.44 solar masses (the <a href="/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit" id="w">Chandrasekhar limit</a>), would collapse since there was nothing known at that time could stop it from doing so. His arguments were opposed by <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Eddington" id="w">Arthur Eddington</a>, who believed that something would inevitably stop the collapse. Eddington was partly right:  a <a href="/wiki/White_dwarf" id="w">white dwarf</a> slightly more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a <a href="/wiki/Neutron_star" id="w">neutron star</a>. But in 1939, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Oppenheimer" id="w">Robert Oppenheimer</a> published papers (with various co-authors) which predicted that stars above about three solar masses (the <a href="/wiki/Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff_limit" id="w">Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit</a>) would collapse into black holes for the reasons presented by Chandrasekhar.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Oppenheimer and his co-authors used <a href="/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric" id="w">Schwarzschild&#39;s system of coordinates</a> (the only coordinates available in 1939), which produced <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_singularity" id="w">mathematical singularities</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius" id="w">Schwarzschild radius</a>, in other words the equations broke down at the Schwarzschild radius because some of the terms were <a href="/wiki/Infinity" id="w">infinite</a>. This was interpreted as indicating that the Schwarzschild radius was the boundary of a &#34;bubble&#34; in which time &#34;stopped&#34;.  For a few years the collapsed stars were known as &#34;frozen stars&#34; because the calculations indicated that an outside observer would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it inside the Schwarzschild radius. But many physicists could not accept the idea of time standing still inside the Schwarzschild radius, and there was little interest in the subject for over 20 years.</p>
<p>In 1958 <a href="/wiki/David_Finkelstein" id="w">David Finkelstein</a> broke the deadlock over &#34;stopped time&#34; and introduced the concept of the <a href="/wiki/Event_horizon" id="w">event horizon</a> by presenting the <a href="/wiki/Eddington-Finkelstein_coordinates" id="w">Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates</a>, which enabled him to show that &#34;The Schwarzschild surface r = 2m is not a singularity but acts as a perfect unidirectional membrane: causal influences can cross it but only in one direction&#34;.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Note that at this stage all theories, including Finkelstein&#39;s, covered only non-rotating, uncharged black holes.</p>
<p>In 1963 <a href="/wiki/Roy_Kerr" id="w">Roy Kerr</a> extended Finkelstein&#39;s analysis by presenting the <a href="/wiki/Kerr_metric" id="w">Kerr metric</a> (coordinates) and showing how this made it possible to predict the properties of <a href="/wiki/Rotating_black_hole" id="w">rotating black holes</a>.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> In addition to its theoretical interest, Kerr&#39;s work made black holes more believable for astronomers, since black holes are formed from stars and all known stars rotate.</p>
<p>In 1967 astronomers discovered <a href="/wiki/Pulsars" id="w">pulsars</a>, and within a few years could show that the known pulsars were rapidly rotating <a href="/wiki/Neutron_star" id="w">neutron stars</a>. Until that time, neutron stars were also regarded as just theoretical curiosities. So the discovery of pulsars awakened interest in all types of ultra-dense objects that might be formed by gravitational collapse.</p>
<p>In December 1967 the theoretical physicist <a href="/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler" id="w">John Wheeler</a> coined the expression &#34;black hole&#34; in his public lecture <i>Our Universe: the Known and Unknown</i>, and this mysterious, slightly menacing phrase attracted more attention than the static-sounding &#34;frozen star&#34;.

<p>{{Main}}
Several alternative models, which behave like a black hole but avoid the singularity, have been proposed. However, most researchers judge these concepts artificial, as they are more complicated but do not give near term observable differences from black holes (see <a href="/wiki/Occam%26%2339%3Bs_razor" id="w">Occam&#39;s razor</a>). The most prominent alternative theory is the <a href="/wiki/Gravastar" id="w">Gravastar</a>.</p>

<a id="Entropy_and_Hawking_radiation" name="Entropy_and_Hawking_radiation"></a><h2>Entropy and Hawking radiation</h2>
<p>In 1971, <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" id="w">Stephen Hawking</a> showed that the total area of the event horizons of any collection of classical black holes can never decrease, even if they collide and swallow each other; that is merge<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup>. This is remarkably similar to the Second Law of <a href="/wiki/Thermodynamics" id="w">Thermodynamics</a>, with area playing the role of <a href="/wiki/Entropy" id="w">entropy</a>. As a classical object with zero temperature it was assumed that black holes had zero entropy; if so the second law of thermodynamics would be violated by an entropy-laden material entering the black hole, resulting in a decrease of the total entropy of the universe. Therefore, <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Bekenstein" id="w">Jacob Bekenstein</a> proposed that a black hole should have an entropy, and that it should be proportional to its horizon area. Since black holes do not classically emit radiation, the thermodynamic viewpoint seemed simply an analogy, since zero temperature implies infinite changes in entropy with any addition of heat, which implies infinite entropy. However, in 1974, Hawking applied <a href="/wiki/Quantum_field_theory" id="w">quantum field theory</a> to the curved spacetime around the event horizon and discovered that black holes emit <a href="/wiki/Hawking_radiation" id="w">Hawking radiation</a>, a form of <a href="/wiki/Thermal_radiation" id="w">thermal radiation</a>, allied to the <a href="/wiki/Unruh_effect" id="w">Unruh effect</a>, which implied they had a positive temperature. This strengthened the analogy being drawn between black hole dynamics and thermodynamics: using the <a href="/wiki/Laws_of_black_hole_mechanics#The First Law" id="w">first law of black hole mechanics</a>, it follows that the entropy of a non-rotating black hole is one quarter of the area of the horizon. This is a universal result and can be extended to apply to cosmological horizons such as in <a href="/wiki/De_Sitter_space" id="w">de Sitter space</a>. It was later suggested that black holes are maximum-entropy objects, meaning that the maximum possible entropy of a region of space is the entropy of the largest black hole that can fit into it. This led to the <a href="/wiki/Holographic_principle" id="w">holographic principle</a>.</p>
<p>The Hawking radiation reflects a characteristic <a href="/wiki/Temperature" id="w">temperature</a> of the black hole, which can be calculated from its entropy. The more its temperature falls, the more massive a black hole becomes: the more energy a black hole absorbs, the colder it gets. A black hole with roughly the <a href="/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)#23" id="w">mass of the planet Mercury</a> would have a temperature in equilibrium with the <a href="/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" id="w">cosmic microwave background</a> radiation (about 2.73 K). More massive than this, a black hole will be colder than the background radiation, and it will gain energy from the background faster than it gives energy up through Hawking radiation, becoming even colder still. However, for a less massive black hole the effect implies that the mass of the black hole will slowly evaporate with time, with the black hole becoming hotter and hotter as it does so. Although these effects are negligible for black holes massive enough to have been formed astronomically, they would rapidly become significant for hypothetical <a href="/wiki/Micro_black_hole" id="w">smaller black holes</a>, where quantum-mechanical effects dominate. Indeed, small black holes are predicted to undergo runaway evaporation and eventually vanish in a burst of radiation.

Although general relativity can be used to perform a semi-classical calculation of black hole entropy, this situation is theoretically unsatisfying. In <a href="/wiki/Statistical_mechanics" id="w">statistical mechanics</a>, entropy is understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system which have the same macroscopic qualities(such as <a href="/wiki/Mass" id="w">mass</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charge" id="w">charge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pressure" id="w">pressure</a>, etc.). But without a satisfactory theory of <a href="/wiki/Quantum_gravity" id="w">quantum gravity</a>, one cannot perform such a computation for black holes. Some promise has been shown by <a href="/wiki/String_theory" id="w">string theory</a>, however. There one posits that the microscopic degrees of freedom of the black hole are <a href="/wiki/D-brane" id="w">D-branes</a>. By counting the states of D-branes with given charges and energy, the entropy for certain <a href="/wiki/Supersymmetric" id="w">supersymmetric</a> black holes has been reproduced. Extending the region of validity of these calculations is an ongoing area of research.</p>
<a id="Black_hole_unitarity" name="Black_hole_unitarity"></a><h2>Black hole unitarity</h2>
<p>An open question in fundamental physics is the so-called information loss paradox, or <a href="/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox" id="w">black hole unitarity</a> paradox. Classically, the laws of physics are the same run forward or in reverse. That is, if the position and velocity of every particle in the universe were measured, we could (disregarding <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory" id="w">chaos</a>) work backwards to discover the history of the universe arbitrarily far in the past. In quantum mechanics, this corresponds to a vital property called <a href="/wiki/Unitarity" id="w">unitarity</a> which has to do with the conservation of probability.<sup id="_ref-PlayDice000_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PlayDice000" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>Black holes, however, might violate this rule. The position under classical general relativity is subtle but straightforward: because of the classical <a href="/wiki/No_hair_theorem" id="w">no hair theorem</a>, we can never determine what went into the black hole. However, as seen from the outside, information is never actually destroyed, as matter falling into the black hole takes an infinite time to reach the event horizon.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Bekenstein_bound" id="w">Ideas about quantum gravity</a>, on the other hand, suggest that there can only be a limited finite entropy (i.e. a maximum finite amount of information) associated with the space near the horizon; but the change in the entropy of the horizon plus the entropy of the Hawking radiation is always sufficient to take up all of the entropy of matter and energy falling into the black hole.</p>
<p>Many physicists are concerned however that this is still not sufficiently well understood. In particular, at a quantum level, is the quantum state of the Hawking radiation uniquely determined by the history of what has fallen into the black hole; and is the history of what has fallen into the black hole uniquely determined by the quantum state of the black hole and the radiation? This is what determinism, and unitarity, would require.</p>
<p>For a long time <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" id="w">Stephen Hawking</a> had opposed such ideas, holding to his original 1975 position that the Hawking radiation is entirely thermal and therefore entirely random, containing none of the information held in material the hole has swallowed in the past; this information he reasoned had been lost.  However, on <a href="/wiki/21_July" id="w">21 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a> he presented a new argument, reversing his previous position.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> On this new calculation, the entropy (and hence information) associated with the black hole escapes in the Hawking radiation itself, although making sense of it, even in principle, is still difficult until the black hole completes its evaporation; until then it is impossible to relate in a 1:1 way the information in the Hawking radiation (embodied in its detailed internal correlations) to the initial state of the system. Once the black hole evaporates completely, then such an identification can be made, and unitarity is preserved.</p>
<p>By the time Hawking completed his calculation, it was already very clear from the AdS/CFT correspondence that black holes decay in a unitary way. This is because the fireballs in gauge theories, which are analogous to Hawking radiation are unquestionably unitary. Hawking&#39;s new calculation have not really been evaluated by the specialist scientific community, because the methods he uses are unfamiliar and of dubious consistency; but Hawking himself found it sufficiently convincing to pay out on a <a href="/wiki/Thorne-Hawking-Preskill_bet" id="w">bet</a> he had made in 1997 with Caltech physicist <a href="/wiki/John_Preskill" id="w">John Preskill</a>, to considerable media interest.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/General_relativity" id="w">general relativity</a>, there are many known solutions of the <a href="/wiki/Einstein_field_equations" id="w">Einstein field equations</a> which describes  <a href="/wiki/Black_hole#Types of black holes" id="w">different types of black holes</a> . The <a href="/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric" id="w">Schwarzschild metric</a> is one of the earliest and simplest solutions.

<p>where <span class="math">\mathrm{d}\Omega^2 = \mathrm{d}\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\; \mathrm{d}\phi^2</span> is a standard element of solid angle.</p>
<p>According to general relativity, a gravitating object will collapse into a black hole if its radius is smaller than a characteristic distance, known as the <a href="/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius" id="w">Schwarzschild radius</a>. (Indeed, <a href="/wiki/Buchdahl%26%2339%3Bs_theorem" id="w">Buchdahl&#39;s theorem</a> in general relativity shows that in the case of a <a href="/wiki/Fluid_solution" id="w">perfect fluid model</a> of a compact object, the true lower limit is somewhat larger than the Schwarzschild radius.) Below this radius, spacetime is so strongly curved that any light ray emitted in this region, regardless of the direction in which it is emitted, will travel towards the centre of the system. Because <a href="/wiki/Special_relativity" id="w">relativity</a> forbids anything from traveling <a href="/wiki/Faster-than-light" id="w">faster than light</a>, anything below the Schwarzschild radius &#8211; including the constituent particles of the gravitating object &#8211; will collapse into the centre. A <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_singularity" id="w">gravitational singularity</a>, a region of theoretically infinite density, forms at this point. Because not even light can escape from within the Schwarzschild radius, a classical black hole would truly appear <a href="/wiki/Black" id="w">black</a>.</p>
<p>The Schwarzschild radius is given by</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">r_{\rm S} = {2\,Gm \over c^2} </span></dd></dl>
<p>where <i>G</i> is the <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_constant" id="w">gravitational constant</a>, <i>m</i> is the <a href="/wiki/Mass" id="w">mass</a> of the object, and <i>c</i> is the <a href="/wiki/Speed_of_light" id="w">speed of light</a>. For an object with the mass of the <a href="/wiki/Earth" id="w">Earth</a>, the Schwarzschild radius is a mere 9 millimeters &#8212; about the size of a <a href="/wiki/Marble_(toy)" id="w">marble</a>.</p>
<p>The mean density inside the Schwarzschild radius decreases as the mass of the black hole increases, so while an earth-mass black hole would have a density of 2&#160;×&#160;10<sup>30</sup>&#160;kg/m³, a supermassive black hole of 10<sup>9</sup> <a href="/wiki/Solar_mass" id="w">solar masses</a> has a density of around 20&#160;kg/m³, less than water! The mean density is given by</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">\rho=\frac{3\,c^6}{32\pi m^2G^3}.</span></dd></dl>
<p>Since the Earth has a mean radius of 6371 km, its volume would have to be reduced 4 × 10<sup>26</sup> times to collapse into a black hole. For an object with the mass of the <a href="/wiki/Sun" id="w">Sun</a>, the Schwarzschild radius is approximately 3&#160;km, much smaller than the Sun&#39;s current radius of about 696,000 km. It is also significantly smaller than the radius to which the Sun will ultimately shrink after exhausting its nuclear fuel, which is several thousand kilometers. More massive stars can collapse into black holes at the end of their lifetimes.</p>
<p>The formula also implies that any object with a given mean density is a black hole if its radius is large enough. The same formula applies for <a href="/wiki/White_holes" id="w">white holes</a> as well. For example, if the <a href="/wiki/Observable_universe" id="w">observable universe</a> has a mean density equal to the <a href="/wiki/Critical_density" id="w">critical density</a>, then it is a <a href="/wiki/White_hole" id="w">white hole</a>, since its <a href="/wiki/Singularity" id="w">singularity</a> is in the past and not in the future as should be for a black hole.</p>
<p>There is also the Black Hole Entropy formula:</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">S = \frac{Akc^3}{4\hbar G}.</span></dd></dl>
<p>Where <b>A</b> is the area of the event horizon of the black hole, <b><span class="math">\hbar</span></b> is <a href="/wiki/Dirac%26%2339%3Bs_constant" id="w">Dirac&#39;s constant</a> (the &#34;reduced <a href="/wiki/Planck_constant" id="w">Planck constant</a>&#34;), <b>k</b> is the <a href="/wiki/Boltzmann_constant" id="w">Boltzmann constant</a>, <b>G</b> is the <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_constant" id="w">gravitational constant</a>, <b>c</b> is the <a href="/wiki/Speed_of_light" id="w">speed of light</a> and <b>S</b> is the <a href="/wiki/Entropy" id="w">entropy</a>.</p>
<p>A convenient length scale to measure black hole processes is the &#34;gravitational radius&#34;, which is equal to
</p><dl><dd><span class="math">r_{\rm G} = {Gm \over c^2} .</span></dd></dl>
<p>When expressed in terms of this length scale, many phenomena appear at integer radii.
For example, the radius of a Schwarzschild black hole is two gravitational radii and the radius of a maximally rotating Kerr black hole is one gravitational radius. The location of the light circularization radius around a Schwarzschild black hole (where light may orbit the hole in an unstable circular orbit) is <span class="math">3r_{\rm G}</span>. The location of the marginally stable orbit, thought to be close to the inner edge of an accretion disk, is at <span class="math">6r_{\rm G}</span> for a Schwarzschild black hole.</p>
