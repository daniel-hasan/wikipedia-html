The creek flows east in a valley of the <a href="/wiki/Ridge-and-valley_Appalachians" id="w">Ridge-and-valley Appalachians</a>, through sandstone, limestone, and shale from the <a href="/wiki/Ordovician" id="w">Ordovician</a>, <a href="/wiki/Silurian" id="w">Silurian</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Devonian" id="w">Devonian</a> periods.</p>

The western part of White Deer Hole Creek has very high water quality and is the only major creek in Lycoming County classified as &#34;Class A Wild Trout Waters&#34;, defined by the <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania_Fish_and_Boat_Commission" id="w">Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission</a> as &#34;streams which support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long-term and rewarding sport fishery.&#34;<sup id="_ref-class a_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-class a" title="">[1]</a></sup> The rest of the creek and its major tributary (Spring Creek) are kept <a href="/wiki/Fish_stocking" id="w">stocked</a>.

<p>Historically, two paths of the native <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_the_United_States" id="w">indigenous peoples</a> ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek. Settlers arrived by 1770, but fled in 1778 during the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution" id="w">American Revolutionary War</a>. They returned and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County when it was formed in 1795. A logging railroad ran along the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber <a href="/wiki/Clearcutting" id="w">clearcutting</a> and small-scale lumbering continues. During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> a <a href="/wiki/Trinitrotoluene" id="w">TNT</a> plant was built in the watershed, which became a federal prison in 1952. Most development is in the eastern end of the valley, with two <a href="/wiki/Unincorporated_area" id="w">unincorporated</a> villages, the hamlet, and most of the farms (many <a href="/wiki/Amish" id="w">Amish</a>). </p>
<a id="Name" name="Name"></a><h2>Name</h2>
<p>Two <a href="/wiki/Etymology" id="w">etymologies</a> have been suggested for White Deer Hole Creek&#39;s unusual name. According to Donehoo, it is a translation of the <a href="/wiki/Lenape_language" id="w">Lenape</a> <i>Woap-achtu-woalhen</i> (literally &#34;white-deer digs a hole&#34;), meaning &#34;where the white deer digs&#34;. It is <i>Opauchtooalin</i> on the earliest map  showing the creek (1755), while a 1759 map has both <i>Opaghtanoten</i> and its translation, &#34;White Flint Creek&#34;. These are seen as corruptions of <i>Woap-achtu-woalhen</i>, and by 1770 (when the first settlers arrived) a map has &#34;White Deer hole&#34; (<i>sic</i>).<sup id="_ref-donehoo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-donehoo" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1870, 88-year-old John Farley gave a second explanation of the name. His family had settled on the banks of White Deer Hole Creek in 1787, and John&#39;s father John built a mill on the creek by 1789. The creek was named because &#34;a white deer is said to have been killed at an early day in a low hole or pond of water that once existed where my father built his mill&#34;. The &#34;hole&#34; was &#34;a large circular basin of low ground of some ten&#160;acres in extent....after my father&#39;s mill and dam were built the water of the dam overflowed and covered the most of the hollow basin of ground.&#34;<sup id="_ref-history_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history" title="">[3]</a></sup> The mill was just west of the mouth at the unincorporated village of Allenwood (then called Uniontown), now in Gregg Township in Union County. </p>

<p>The first recorded inhabitants of the Susquehanna River valley were the <a href="/wiki/Susquehannock" id="w">Susquehannocks</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Iroquoian_languages" id="w">Iroquoian</a> speaking people. Their name meant &#34;people of the muddy river&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Algonquin_language" id="w">Algonquin</a>, but their name for themselves is unknown. Decimated by diseases and warfare, they had largely died out, moved away, or been <a href="/wiki/Cultural_assimilation" id="w">assimilated</a> into other tribes by the early 18th century. The lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were then chiefly occupied by the <a href="/wiki/Christian_Munsee" id="w">Munsee</a> <a href="/wiki/Phratry" id="w">phratry</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Lenape" id="w">Lenape</a> (or <i>Delaware</i>), and were under the nominal control of the Five (later Six) Nations of the <a href="/wiki/Iroquois" id="w">Iroquois</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Great_Island_Path" id="w">Great Island Path</a> was a major trail that ran north along the Susquehanna River from the <a href="/wiki/Shamokin_(village)" id="w">Saponi village of Shamokin</a> at modern <a href="/wiki/Sunbury%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Sunbury</a>, fording the river there and following the west bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River north until White Deer Hole valley. The path turned west at Allenwood and followed White Deer Hole Creek until about the present location of Elimsport. There it headed northwest, crossed North White Deer Ridge and passed west through the <a href="/wiki/Nippenose_Township%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Nippenose</a> valley, then turned north and crossed Bald Eagle Mountain via McElhattan Creek and ran along the south bank of the river to the Great Island (near the present day city of <a href="/wiki/Lock_Haven%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Lock Haven</a>). The stretch from the mouth of the creek to the Nippenose valley is approximately followed by Route 44.

<p>The borders of the county have changed considerably since, but the White Deer Hole Creek watershed still approximates the county line in the south.

<p>In the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by <a href="/wiki/Loyalist_(American_Revolution)" id="w">Loyalists</a> and Native Americans allied with the British.

<p>Beginning with the first settlers, much of the land along White Deer Hole Creek was slowly cleared of timber. Small sawmills were built in the 19th century, and a much larger lumber operation was run by the Vincent Lumber Company from 1901 to 1904. They built a <a href="/wiki/Narrow_gauge_railway" id="w">narrow gauge</a> {{convert}} railroad from Elimsport {{convert}} west into timber, and a line east to Allenwood and the <a href="/wiki/Reading_Railroad" id="w">Reading Railroad</a> there. The lumber railroad ran parallel to the creek, with the end of the track near the Fourth Gap. It was incorporated on <a href="/wiki/June_24" id="w">June 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1901" id="w">1901</a> (around the time of construction) as the &#34;Allenwood and Western Railroad&#34;. The lumbering operation ceased in 1904 when the forests were gone. The railroad was torn up, and its one second-hand <a href="/wiki/Shay_locomotive" id="w">Shay locomotive</a> was moved to the Vincent Lumber Company operation at Denholm (in <a href="/wiki/Juniata_County%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Juniata County</a>).<sup id="_ref-taber atlas_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-taber atlas" title="">[40]</a></sup> </p>
<p>From 1900 to 1935, much of what is now Tiadaghton State Forest was purchased by Pennsylvania from lumber companies that had no further use for the clear-cut land. In the 1930s there were seven <a href="/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps" id="w">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> camps to construct roads and trails in the forest.<sup id="_ref-tiadaghton_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tiadaghton" title="">[36]</a></sup> </p>
