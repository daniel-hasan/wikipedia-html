<p><b><i>The Ewok Adventure</i></b> (<a href="/wiki/1984" id="w">1984</a>) was an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Television_movie" id="w">made-for-TV film</a> set in the <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" id="w">Star Wars</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_galaxy" id="w">galaxy</a>. It was released theatrically overseas as <b><i>Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure</i></b>, and is known by that title today. The film focuses on the struggles of a brother and sister, stranded on the <a href="/wiki/Forest_moon_of_Endor" id="w">forest moon of Endor</a>, in locating their parents, who have been kidnapped by a monster known as the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_races_(F-J)#Gorax" id="w">Gorax</a>. The film is set sometime between the fifth and sixth <a href="/wiki/Episodes" id="w">episodes</a> of the Star Wars <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Saga">saga</a>. It is the second of three spin-off films of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_VI:_Return_of_the_Jedi" id="w">Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</a></i>. </p>
<a id="Setting" name="Setting"></a><h2> Setting </h2>

<p>The film is set sometime between <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back" id="w">The Empire Strikes Back</a></i> and <i>Return of the Jedi</i> (hence an <a href="/wiki/Sequel#Interquel" id="w">interquel</a>), and approximately six months before the film&#39;s sequel <i><a href="/wiki/Ewoks:_The_Battle_for_Endor" id="w">Ewoks: The Battle for Endor</a></i>. Because it takes place in the Star Wars universe but does not involve the main characters, it is also a sidequel.  As the film opens, the Towani family&#39;s starcruiser has crashed on the forest moon of Endor, and the Towani parents, Jeremitt and Catarine cannot locate their children, Mace and Cindel.</p>
<a id="Plot_summary" name="Plot_summary"></a><h2> Plot summary </h2>

<p>On the forest moon of Endor, the starcruiser of the Towani family lies wrecked. The Towani family (Catarine, Jeremitt, Mace, and Cindel) are stranded. When Catarine and Jeremitt vanish, the children are found by the Ewok Deej. After Mace tries to kill them, the Ewoks subdue him and take both children to the Ewoks’ home. There, Cindel and Wicket become friends. Shortly thereafter, the Ewoks kill a beast only to find a life-monitor from one of the Towani parents with the creature. </p>
<p>They seek out the Ewok Logray who informs them that the parents have been taken by the monstrous Gorax, who resides in a deserted, dangerous area. A caravan of Ewoks is formed to help the children find their parents. They meet up with a <a href="/wiki/Wistie" id="w">wistie</a> named Izrina and a boisterous Ewok named Chukha before finally reaching the lair of the Gorax. They engage the Gorax in battle, freeing Jeremitt and Catarine, but Chukha is killed. The Gorax is thought destroyed when he is knocked into a chasm, but it takes a final blow from Mace (using Chukha’s axe) to kill the creature, who tries to climb back up after them. Thus reunited, the Towanis decide to stay with the Ewoks until they can repair the starcruiser, and Izrina leaves to go back to her family.</p>

<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h2> Production </h2>
<a id="Inspiration_and_creative_control" name="Inspiration_and_creative_control"></a><h3> Inspiration and creative control </h3>

<p>The original impetus for <i>The Ewok Adventure</i> was an idea <a href="/wiki/George_Lucas" id="w">George Lucas</a> had for a one-hour television special dealing with the Ewoks, but this was eventually expanded into two hours. Lucas had ventured into TV six years earlier with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Star_Wars_Holiday_Special" id="w">The Star Wars Holiday Special</a></i>, which although economically successful for the most part, had proved to be a disaster and embarrassment to Lucas. With <i>The Ewok Adventure</i>, Lucas assumed full control over the content and production of the film, to ensure a film of good quality. One such event during production which exemplifies this need for creative control was around the time when the film neared completion. The production crew had prepared a script and shot a TV advertisement for the upcoming release. The ad featured Mace, Cindel, and Wicket walking into a diner, which was set in the 50&#39;s, where they ordered milkshakes. Mace turns to the camera, and says something to the effect of &#34;Don&#39;t forget to tune in to <i>The Ewok Adventure</i>, on November 25.&#34; When Lucas was shown the commercial for his personal approval, he disliked the idea, and prevented the commercial from airing, as he didn&#39;t like the idea of having his characters appearing on earth in the 50&#39;s.</p>
<a id="Crew" name="Crew"></a><h3> Crew </h3>

<p>Working from a story written by George Lucas, and a screenplay by Bob Carrau, director John Korty transformed the scenic northern California redwood forests into the forest moon of Endor. Joe Johnston, an art director at <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26amp%3B_Magic" id="w">Industrial Light &#38; Magic</a> for years and one of the key concept artists of the classic <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy, acted as production designer. Prior to this movie, Johnston had written and illustrated a book about Ewoks, <i>The Adventures of Teebo: A Tale of Magic and Suspense</i>. This gave him a background to the arboreal aliens that was crucial in designing new Ewoks and their surroundings. </p>
<a id="Effects" name="Effects"></a><h3> Effects </h3>

<p>Both Ewok films were some of the last intensive <a href="/wiki/Stop-motion" id="w">stop-motion</a> animation work Industrial Light &#38; Magic (ILM) produced, as in the early 80s, the technique was being replaced by <a href="/wiki/Go-motion" id="w">go-motion</a> animation, a more advanced form with motorized articulated puppets that moved while the camera shutter was open, capturing motion blur in the otherwise static puppet, eliminating the harsh staccato movement often associated with stop-motion. However, the budgets of the Ewok films were such that go-motion was simply too expensive for the projects, so stop-motion was used to realize creatures such as the condor dragon, the blurrgs, and the boar-wolves. </p>
<p>The Ewok movies proved an opportunity for ILM to hone a technique from <i><a href="/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)" id="w">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></i>. This technique, used in photographing <a href="/wiki/Matte_paintings" id="w">matte paintings</a>, is called <a href="/wiki/Latent_image_matte_painting" id="w">latent image matte painting</a>. In this technique, during live action photography, a section of the camera&#39;s lens blocked off, remaining unexposed, and a painting would be crafted to occupy that space. The film would then be rewound, the blocked areas reversed, and the painting photographed. Since the painting now existed on the original film, there would be no generational quality loss.</p>

<a id="Documentaries_and_commentary" name="Documentaries_and_commentary"></a><h2> Documentaries and commentary </h2>

<p>During the production of <i>The Ewok Adventure</i>, the children in the cast had to balance their school work with acting in the film. During their time on the set, Lucasfilm decided that it might be an educational and rewarding experience for the older children, Eric Walker (Mace) and Warwick Davis (Wicket), to be given their own camera to use between takes. So, calling themselves <i>W&#38;W Productions</i>, Eric and Warwick shot a documentary of the making of the film, but the documentary was never publicly released, and exists now as private home movies to the two. </p>
<p>When the film was released on DVD in 2004, some fans had hoped this documentary would be included on the disc as a bonus feature, but the disc contained nothing but the film itself. Eric Walker and Warwick Davis stated in interviews that they would be happy to record a cast commentary for another future DVD release, if Lucasfilm someday allowed a more detailed release of the films.</p>

In 1985, Random House released a children&#39;s book adaptation of <i>The Ewok Adventure</i> by Amy Ehrlich, titled <i>The Ewoks and the Lost Children</i>, and utilized the story presented in the film, along with stills from the film.</p>
<a id="Sequels" name="Sequels"></a><h2> Sequels </h2>

<p>A sequel to this movie released in 1985. While sequel&#39;s working title was simply <i>Ewoks II</i>, it was released as <i><a href="/wiki/Ewoks:_The_Battle_for_Endor" id="w">Ewoks: The Battle for Endor</a></i>. According to an interview with Warwick Davis, a second sequel, known only as &#34;Ewoks III,&#34; was in at least the planning stages around the late eighties, but the project has been shown to have never come through. The plot of the film, if one was ever developed, was never published.</p>
