The legends of <b>Prester John</b> (also <b>Presbyter John</b>), popular in <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> from the <a href="/wiki/12th_century" id="w">12th</a> through the <a href="/wiki/17th_century" id="w">17th centuries</a>, told of a <a href="/wiki/Christian" id="w">Christian</a> <a href="/wiki/Patriarch" id="w">patriarch</a> and <a href="/wiki/Monarch" id="w">king</a> said to rule over a Christian nation lost amidst the <a href="/wiki/Muslim" id="w">Muslims</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paganism" id="w">pagans</a> in the <a href="/wiki/The_Orient" id="w">Orient</a>. Written accounts of this kingdom are variegated collections of medieval popular fantasy. Reportedly a descendant of one of the <a href="/wiki/Biblical_Magi" id="w">Three Magi</a>, Prester John was said to be a generous ruler and a virtuous man, presiding over a realm full of riches and strange creatures, in which the Patriarch of <a href="/wiki/Saint_Thomas_Christians" id="w">Saint Thomas</a> resided. His kingdom contained such marvels as the <a href="/wiki/Gates_of_Alexander" id="w">Gates of Alexander</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Fountain_of_Youth" id="w">Fountain of Youth</a>, and even bordered the <a href="/wiki/Garden_of_Eden" id="w">Earthly Paradise</a>. Among his treasures was a mirror through which every province could be seen, the fabled original from which derived the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Speculum_literature" id="w">speculum literature</a>&#34; of the late <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a> and <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" id="w">Renaissance</a>, in which the prince&#39;s realms were surveyed and his duties laid out.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>At first, Prester John was imagined to be in <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>; tales of the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Nestorianism" id="w">Nestorian</a>&#34; Christians&#39; evangelistic success there and of <a href="/wiki/Thomas_the_Apostle" id="w">Thomas the Apostle</a>&#39;s subcontinental travels as documented in works like the <i><a href="/wiki/Acts_of_Thomas" id="w">Acts of Thomas</a></i> probably provided the first seeds of the legend. After the coming of the <a href="/wiki/Mongols" id="w">Mongols</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Western_world" id="w">Western world</a>, accounts placed the king in <a href="/wiki/Central_Asia" id="w">Central Asia</a>, and eventually <a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portuguese</a> explorers convinced themselves they had found him in <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" id="w">Ethiopia</a>. Prester John&#39;s kingdom was the object of a quest, firing the imaginations of generations of adventurers, but remaining out of reach. He was a symbol to European Christians of the Church&#39;s universality, transcending culture and geography to encompass all humanity, in a time when ethnic and interreligious tension made such a vision seem distant.</p>

The stories of Saint Thomas proselytizing in India, which date back to at least the 3rd century, had obvious influence on the legend&#39;s development. Distorted reports of the <a href="/wiki/Assyrian_Church_of_the_East" id="w">Assyrian Church of the East</a>&#39;s movements in Asia had a hand as well. This church, called &#34;Nestorian&#34; by Europeans who mistook it as adhering to the teachings of <a href="/wiki/Nestorius" id="w">Nestorius</a>, gained a wide following in the Eastern nations and engaged the Western imagination as an assemblage both exotic and familiarly Christian.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Additionally, a kernel of the tradition may have been drawn from Saint <a href="/wiki/Irenaeus" id="w">Irenaeus</a>&#39;s quotes, recorded by the ecclesiastical historian and bishop <a href="/wiki/Eusebius_of_Caesarea" id="w">Eusebius</a>,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> on the shadowy early Christian figure <a href="/wiki/John_the_Presbyter" id="w">John the Presbyter</a> of <a href="/wiki/Syria" id="w">Syria</a>, supposedly the author of two of the <a href="/wiki/Epistles_of_John" id="w">Epistles of John</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The martyr bishop <a href="/wiki/Papias" id="w">Papias</a> had been Irenaeus&#39; teacher; Papias in turn had received his apostolic tradition from John the Presbyter. Little links this figure to the Prester John legend beyond the name, however.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever its influences, the legend began in earnest in the early 12th century with two reports of visits of an <a href="/wiki/Archbishop" id="w">Archbishop</a> of India to <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" id="w">Constantinople</a> and of a Patriarch of India to <a href="/wiki/Rome" id="w">Rome</a> at the time of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Callixtus_II" id="w">Pope Callixtus II</a> (1119 – 1124).<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> These visits apparently from the <a href="/wiki/Saint_Thomas_Christians" id="w">Saint Thomas Christians</a> of India cannot be confirmed, evidence of both being secondhand reports. Later, the <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> chronicler <a href="/wiki/Otto_of_Freising" id="w">Otto of Freising</a> reports in his <i>Chronicon</i> of 1145 that the previous year he had met a certain <a href="/wiki/Hugh_of_Jabala" id="w">Hugh</a>, bishop of <a href="/wiki/Jabala" id="w">Jabala</a> in <a href="/wiki/Syria" id="w">Syria</a>, at the court of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Eugene_III" id="w">Pope Eugene III</a> in <a href="/wiki/Viterbo" id="w">Viterbo</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Hugh was an emissary of <a href="/wiki/Raymond_of_Antioch" id="w">Prince Raymond</a> of <a href="/wiki/Principality_of_Antioch" id="w">Antioch</a> seeking Western aid against the Saracens after the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Edessa" id="w">Siege of Edessa</a>, and his counsel incited Eugene to call for the <a href="/wiki/Second_Crusade" id="w">Second Crusade</a>. He told Otto, in the presence of the pope, that Prester John, a Nestorian Christian who served in the dual position of priest and king, had regained the city of <a href="/wiki/Ecbatana" id="w">Ecbatana</a> from the brother monarchs of <a href="/wiki/Iran" id="w">Media and Persia</a>, the Samiardi, in a great battle &#34;not many years ago&#34;. Afterwards Prester John allegedly set out for <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" id="w">Jerusalem</a> to rescue the Holy Land, but the swollen waters of the <a href="/wiki/Tigris" id="w">Tigris</a> compelled him to return to his own country. His fabulous wealth was demonstrated by his emerald scepter; his holiness by his descent from the <a href="/wiki/Biblical_Magi" id="w">Three Magi</a>. </p>
<p>Otto&#39;s story appears to be a muddled version of real events. In 1141, the <a href="/wiki/Kara-Khitan_Khanate" id="w">Kara-Khitan Khanate</a> under <a href="/wiki/Yel%C3%BC_Dashi" id="w">Yelü Dashi</a> defeated the <a href="/wiki/Seljuk_Turks" id="w">Seljuk Turks</a> near <a href="/wiki/Samarkand" id="w">Samarkand</a>. The Seljuks ruled over Persia at the time and were the most powerful force in the Muslim world, and the defeat at Samarkand weakened them substantially. The Kara-Khitan were not Christians, however, and there is no reason to suppose Yelü Dashi was ever called Prester John. However, several vassals of the Kara-Khitan practiced Nestorian Christianity, which may have contributed to the legend.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> The idea was introduced into the academic mainstream by <a href="/wiki/Lev_Gumilev" id="w">Lev Gumilev</a> in his popular book about Prester John, &#34;Searches for an Imaginary Kingdom&#34; (1970).</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, the defeat encouraged the Crusaders and inspired a notion of deliverance from the East, and it is possible Otto recorded Hugh&#39;s confused report to prevent complacency in the Crusade&#39;s European backers; according to his account no help could be expected from a powerful Eastern king.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Letter_of_Prester_John" name="Letter_of_Prester_John"></a><h2>Letter of Prester John</h2>
<p>No more of the tale is recorded until about 1165 when copies of the <i>Letter of Prester John</i> started spreading throughout Europe. An epistolary wonder tale with parallels suggesting its author knew the <i><a href="/wiki/Alexander_Romance" id="w">Romance of Alexander</a></i> and the above-mentioned <i>Acts of Thomas</i>, the <i>Letter</i> was supposedly written to the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" id="w">Byzantine Emperor</a> <a href="/wiki/Manuel_I_Comnenus" id="w">Manuel I Comnenus</a> (1143 – 1180) by Prester John, descendant of one of the Three Magi and King of India.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The many marvels of richness and magic it contained captured the imagination of Europeans, and it was translated into numerous languages, including <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language" id="w">Hebrew</a>. It circulated in ever more embellished form for centuries in manuscripts, a hundred examples of which still exist. The invention of <a href="/wiki/Printing" id="w">printing</a> perpetuated the letter&#39;s popularity in printed form; it was still current in popular culture during the period of <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Discovery" id="w">European exploration</a>. Part of the letter&#39;s essence was that a lost kingdom of Nestorian Christians still existed in the vastnesses of Central Asia.</p>
<p>The reports were so far believed that <a href="/wiki/Pope_Alexander_III" id="w">Pope Alexander III</a> sent a letter to Prester John via his emissary Philip, his physician, on <a href="/wiki/September_27" id="w">September 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1177" id="w">1177</a>. Of Philip, nothing more is recorded, but it is most probable he did not return with word from Prester John.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> The <i>Letter</i> continued to circulate, accruing more embellishments with each copy. In modern times <a href="/wiki/Content_analysis" id="w">textual analysis</a> of the letter&#39;s variant Hebrew versions have suggested an origin among the <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jews</a> of northern <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a> or <a href="/wiki/Languedoc" id="w">Languedoc</a>: several Italian words remained in the Hebrew texts.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> At any rate, the <i>Letter</i>’s author was most likely a Westerner, though his or her purpose remains unclear.</p>

In 1221 <a href="/wiki/Jacques_de_Vitry" id="w">Jacques de Vitry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Acre" id="w">Bishop of Acre</a>, returned from the disastrous <a href="/wiki/Fifth_Crusade" id="w">Fifth Crusade</a> with good news: King David of India, the son or grandson of Prester John, had mobilized his armies against the Saracens. He had already conquered <a href="/wiki/Persian_Empire" id="w">Persia</a>, then under the <a href="/wiki/Khwarezmian_Empire" id="w">Khwarezmian Empire</a>&#39;s control, and was moving on towards <a href="/wiki/Baghdad" id="w">Baghdad</a> as well. This descendent of the great king who had defeated the Seljuks in 1141 planned to reconquer and rebuild Jerusalem.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The bishop of Acre was right in the fact that a great King was conquering Persia; however &#34;King David&#34;, as it turned out, was no benevolent Nestorian monarch nor even a Christian, but the pagan warlord <a href="/wiki/Genghis_Khan" id="w">Genghis Khan</a>. His reign took the story of Prester John in a new direction. The <a href="/wiki/Mongol_Empire" id="w">Mongol Empire</a>&#39;s rise gave Western Christians the opportunity to visit lands they had never seen before, and they set out in large numbers along the Empire&#39;s secure roads. Belief that a lost Nestorian kingdom existed in the east, or that the <a href="/wiki/Crusader_states" id="w">Crusader states</a>&#39; salvation depended on an alliance with an Eastern monarch, explains the numerous Christian ambassadors and missionaries sent to the Mongols. These include the <a href="/wiki/Franciscan" id="w">Franciscan</a> explorers <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_da_Pian_del_Carpine" id="w">Giovanni da Pian del Carpine</a> in 1245 and <a href="/wiki/William_of_Rubruck" id="w">William of Rubruck</a> in 1253.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>The link between Prester John and Genghis Khan was elaborated upon at this time as the Prester became identified with Genghis&#39; foster father, <a href="/wiki/Wang_Khan" id="w">Toghrul</a>, king of the <a href="/wiki/Keraits" id="w">Keraits</a>, given the <a href="/wiki/Jin_Dynasty%2C_1115%E2%80%931234" id="w">Jin</a> title Wang Khan Toghrul. Fairly truthful chroniclers and explorers such as <a href="/wiki/Marco_Polo" id="w">Marco Polo</a>,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Crusader-historian <a href="/wiki/Jean_de_Joinville" id="w">Jean de Joinville</a>,<sup id="_ref-Joinville_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Joinville" title="">[18]</a></sup> and the Franciscan voyager <a href="/wiki/Odoric_of_Pordenone" id="w">Odoric of Pordenone</a><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> stripped Prester John of much of his otherworldly veneer, portraying him as a more realistic earthly monarch. Joinville describes Genghis Khan in his chronicle as a &#34;wise man&#34; who unites all the Tartar tribes and leads them to victory against their strongest enemy, Prester John.<sup id="_ref-Joinville_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Joinville" title="">[18]</a></sup> William of Rubruck says a certain &#34;Vut&#34;, lord of the Keraits and brother to the Nestorian <i>King</i> John, was defeated by the Mongols under Genghis. Genghis made off with Vut&#39;s daughter and married her to his son, and their union produced <a href="/wiki/M%C3%B6ngke_Khan" id="w">Möngke</a>, the Khan at the time William wrote.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> According to Marco Polo&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Travels_of_Marco_Polo" id="w">Travels</a></i>, the war between the Prester and Genghis started when Genghis, new ruler of the rebellious Tartars, asked for the hand of Prester John&#39;s daughter in marriage. Angered that his lowly vassal would make such a request, Prester John denied him in no uncertain terms. In the war that followed, Genghis triumphed and Prester John perished.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The historical figure behind these accounts, Toghrul, was in fact a Nestorian Christian monarch defeated by Genghis. He had fostered the future Khan after the death of his father <a href="/wiki/Yesugei" id="w">Yesugei</a> and was one of his early allies, but the two had a falling out. After Toghrul rejected a proposal to wed his son and daughter to Genghis&#39; children, the rift between them grew until war broke out in 1203. Genghis captured Toghrul&#39;s daughter <a href="/wiki/Sorghaghtani_Beki" id="w">Sorghaghtani Beki</a> and married her to his son <a href="/wiki/Tolui" id="w">Tolui</a>; they had several children, including Möngke, <a href="/wiki/Kublai_Khan" id="w">Kublai</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hulagu_Khan" id="w">Hulagu</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ariq_Boke" id="w">Ariq Boke</a>.</p>
<p>The major characteristic of Prester John tales from this period is the kings&#39; portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. But as the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had ever really been a Central Asian king.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> At any rate they had little hope of finding him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the Empire had provided. In works such as <i><a href="/wiki/John_Mandeville" id="w">The Travels of Sir John Mandeville</a></i><sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> and <i>Historia Trium Regum</i> by <a href="/wiki/John_of_Hildesheim" id="w">John of Hildesheim</a>,<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Prester John&#39;s domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, but back in India proper, or some other exotic locale. <a href="/wiki/Wolfram_von_Eschenbach" id="w">Wolfram von Eschenbach</a> tied the history of Prester John to the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Grail" id="w">Holy Grail</a> legend in his poem <i><a href="/wiki/Parzival" id="w">Parzival</a></i>, in which the Prester is the son of the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight <a href="/wiki/Feirefiz" id="w">Feirefiz</a>.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>

Though Prester John had been considered the ruler of India since the legend&#39;s beginnings, &#34;India&#34; was a vague concept to the Europeans. Writers often spoke of the &#34;Three Indias&#34;, and lacking any real knowledge of the <a href="/wiki/Indian_Ocean" id="w">Indian Ocean</a>, they sometimes considered <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" id="w">Ethiopia</a> one of the three. Westerners knew Ethiopia was a mighty Christian nation, but contact had been sporadic since the rise of Islam. Since no Prester John was to be found in Asia, European imagination moved him around the blurry frontiers of &#34;India&#34; until they found an appropriately powerful kingdom for him in Ethiopia.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Marco Polo had discussed Ethiopia as a magnificent Christian land<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" id="w">Orthodox Christians</a> had a legend that the nation would one day rise up and invade <a href="/wiki/Arabia" id="w">Arabia</a>,<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> but they did not place Prester John there. Then in 1306 thirty Ethiopian ambassadors from Emperor <a href="/wiki/Wedem_Arad" id="w">Wedem Arad</a> came to Europe, and Prester John was mentioned as the patriarch of their church in a record of their visit.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> The first clear description of an African Prester John is in the <i>Mirabilia Descripta</i> of <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Order" id="w">Dominican</a> missionary <a href="/wiki/Jordanus" id="w">Jordanus</a>, around 1329.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> In discussing the &#34;Third India&#34;, Jordanus records a number of fanciful stories about the land and its king, whom he says Europeans call Prester John. After this point, an African location became increasingly popular; by the time the emperor <a href="/wiki/Dawit_II_of_Ethiopia" id="w">Lebna Dengel</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portuguese</a> had established diplomatic contact with each other in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the <a href="/wiki/Emperor_of_Ethiopia" id="w">Emperor of Ethiopia</a>.<sup id="_ref-emperor_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emperor" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor <a href="/wiki/Zara_Yaqob" id="w">Zara Yaqob</a> attended the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Florence" id="w">Council of Florence</a> in 1441, they were confused when council prelates insisted on referring to their monarch as Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob&#39;s list of regnal names did that title occur. &#34;No matter,&#34; says <a href="/wiki/Robert_Silverberg" id="w">Robert Silverberg</a>, author of <i>The Realm of Prester John</i>. &#34;Prester John was what Europe wanted to call the King of Ethiopia, and Prester John is what Europe called him.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Some writers who used the title did understand it was not an indigenous honorific; for instance Friar Jordanus seems to use it simply because his readers would have been familiar with it, not because he thought it authentic.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>While Ethiopia has been claimed for many years as the origin of the Prester John legend, most modern experts believe the legend was simply adapted to fit that nation in the same fashion it had been projected upon Wang Khan and Central Asia during the 13th century. Modern scholars find nothing about the Prester or his country in the early material that would make Ethiopia a more suitable identification than any place else, and furthermore, specialists in Ethiopian history have effectively demonstrated the story was not widely known there until well after European contact. When the <a href="/wiki/Czech_people" id="w">Czech</a> Franciscan <a href="/wiki/Remedius_Prutky" id="w">Remedius Prutky</a> asked Emperor <a href="/wiki/Iyasu_II_of_Ethiopia" id="w">Iyasu II</a> about this identification in 1751, Prutky states the man was &#34;astonished, and told me that the kings of Abyssinia had never been accustomed to call themselves by this name.&#34;<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> In a footnote to this passage, <a href="/wiki/Richard_R._K._Pankhurst" id="w">Richard Pankhurst</a> opines that this is apparently the first recorded statement by an Ethiopian monarch about this tale, and they were likely ignorant of the title until Prutky&#39;s inquiry.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<a id="End_of_the_legend" name="End_of_the_legend"></a><h2>End of the legend</h2>
<p>When 17th century academics like the German <a href="/wiki/Orientalism" id="w">orientalist</a> <a href="/wiki/Hiob_Ludolf" id="w">Hiob Ludolf</a> proved that there was no actual native connection between Prester John and the Ethiopian monarchs,<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> the fabled king left the maps for good.

<p>Though the prospect of finding Prester John had long since vanished, the tales continued to inspire through the 20th century. <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" id="w">William Shakespeare</a>&#39;s 1600 play <i><a href="/wiki/Much_Ado_About_Nothing" id="w">Much Ado About Nothing</a></i> contains an early modern reference to the legendary king,<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> and in 1910 <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> novelist and politician <a href="/wiki/John_Buchan%2C_1st_Baron_Tweedsmuir" id="w">John Buchan</a> used the legend in his sixth book, <i><a href="/wiki/Prester_John_(novel)" id="w">Prester John</a></i>, to supplement a plot about a <a href="/wiki/Zulu" id="w">Zulu</a> uprising in <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a>. The book was popular, and exists as an excellent example of the early 20th century <a href="/wiki/Adventure_novel" id="w">adventure novel</a>.

The Prester and his kingdom also figure prominently in <a href="/wiki/Umberto_Eco" id="w">Umberto Eco</a>&#39;s 2000 novel <i><a href="/wiki/Baudolino" id="w">Baudolino</a></i>, in which the titular protagonist enlists his friends to write the <i>Letter of Prester John</i> for his stepfather <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Barbarossa" id="w">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, but it is stolen before they can send it out. Eventually Baudolino and company determine to visit the priest&#39;s wonderful kingdom which turns out to be everything and nothing like they expected.</p>
