{{History of war}}
A <b>siege</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Military" id="w">military</a> <a href="/wiki/Blockade" id="w">blockade</a> of a <a href="/wiki/City" id="w">city</a> or <a href="/wiki/Fortress" id="w">fortress</a> with the intent of conquering by force or <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_attrition" id="w">attrition</a>, often accompanied by an assault. The term derives from the Latin word for &#34;seat&#34; or &#34;sitting.&#34;<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> A siege occurs when an attacker encounters a city or fortress that refuses to <a href="/wiki/Surrender_(military)" id="w">surrender</a> and cannot be easily taken by a <a href="/wiki/Frontal_assault" id="w">frontal assault</a>. Sieges involve surrounding the target and blocking the reinforcement or escape of troops or provision of supplies (a tactic known as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Investment_(military)" id="w">investment</a>&#34;<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>), typically coupled with attempts to reduce the fortifications by means of <a href="/wiki/Siege_engine" id="w">siege engines</a>, <a href="/wiki/Artillery" id="w">artillery</a> bombardment, <a href="/wiki/Mining_(military)" id="w">mining</a> (also known as mining), or the use of deception or treachery to bypass defenses. Failing a military outcome, sieges can often be decided by starvation, thirst or disease, which can afflict both the attacker or defender.</p>
<p>The deadliest and largest siege of a city ever in history was the <a href="/wiki/Nazi" id="w">Nazi</a> <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Leningrad" id="w">Siege of Leningrad</a> that lasted 29 months during the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a>, and caused about 1.2 million civilian deaths. About half of all the dead from that siege are buried just at one cemetery, <a href="/wiki/Piskaryovskoye_Memorial_Cemetery" id="w">Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery</a> in <a href="/wiki/St._Petersburg" id="w">St. Petersburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a>, which is the largest cemetery in the world.</p>
<p>Sieges probably predate the development of cities as large population centers.  Ancient cities in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" id="w">Middle East</a> show <a href="/wiki/Archeology" id="w">archaeological</a> evidence of having had fortified <a href="/wiki/City_wall" id="w">city walls</a>. During the <a href="/wiki/Warring_States" id="w">Warring States</a> era of <a href="/wiki/Ancient_China" id="w">ancient China</a>, there is both textual and archaeological evidence of prolonged sieges and siege machinery used against the defenders of city walls. Siege machinery was also a tradition of the ancient <a href="/wiki/Greco-Roman" id="w">Greco-Roman</a> world. During the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" id="w">Renaissance</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Early_Modern" id="w">Early Modern</a> period, siege warfare dominated the conduct of war in <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>. <a href="/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci" id="w">Leonardo da Vinci</a> gained as much of his renown from the design of fortifications as from his artwork.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Medieval" id="w">Medieval</a> campaigns were generally designed around a succession of sieges.  In the <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France" id="w">Napoleonic</a> era, increasing use of ever more powerful <a href="/wiki/Cannon" id="w">cannon</a> reduced the value of fortifications.  In modern times, <a href="/wiki/Trench_warfare" id="w">trenches</a> replaced walls, and <a href="/wiki/Bunker" id="w">bunkers</a>  replaced castles. In the 20th century, the significance of the classical siege declined. With the advent of <a href="/wiki/Maneuver_warfare" id="w">mobile warfare</a>, one single fortified stronghold is no longer as decisive as it once was. While sieges do still occur, they are not as common as they once were due to changes in modes of battle, principally the ease by which huge volumes of destructive power can be directed onto a static target.  Sieges in present day are more commonly either smaller hostage, militant, or extreme resisting-arrest situations such as the <a href="/wiki/Waco_Siege" id="w">Waco Siege</a>.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, siege warfare is a form of low-intensity warfare (until an assault takes place) characterized in that at least one party holds a strong defense position, it is highly static situation, the element of attrition is typically strong and there are plenty of opportunities for negotiations.</p>

<a id="The_essential_of_city_walls" name="The_essential_of_city_walls"></a><h3> The essential of city walls </h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Assyrians" id="w">Assyrians</a> deployed large labour forces to build new palaces, temples and defensive walls.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some settlements in the <a href="/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization" id="w">Indus Valley Civilization</a> were also fortified. By about 3500 B.C., hundreds of small farming villages dotted the <a href="/wiki/Indus" id="w">Indus</a> floodplain. Many of these settlements had fortifications and planned streets. The stone and mud brick houses of <a href="/wiki/Kot_Diji" id="w">Kot Diji</a> were clustered behind massive stone flood dikes and defensive walls, for neighboring communities quarreled constantly about the control of prime agricultural land.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Mundigak (c. 2500 B.C.) in present day south-east <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" id="w">Afghanistan</a> has defensive walls and square bastions of sun dried bricks.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>City walls and fortifications were essential for the defense of the first cities in the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Near_East" id="w">ancient Near East</a>. The walls were built by mud bricks, stone, wood or a combination of these materials depending on local availability. City walls may also have served the dual purpose of showing presumptive enemies the might of the Kingdom. The great walls surrounding the <a href="/wiki/Sumer" id="w">Sumerian</a> city of <a href="/wiki/Uruk" id="w">Uruk</a> gained such a wide-spread reputation. The walls were 9.5 km / 6 miles in length, and raised up to 12 metres / 40 feet in height. Later the walls of <a href="/wiki/Babylon" id="w">Babylon</a>, reinforced by towers and moats, gained a similar reputation. In <a href="/wiki/Anatolia" id="w">Anatolia</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Hittites" id="w">Hittites</a> built massive stone walls around their cities, taking advantage of the hillsides. In <a href="/wiki/Shang_Dynasty" id="w">Shang Dynasty</a> <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a>, at the site of Ao, large walls were erected in the 15th century BC that had dimensions of 20 meters / 65 feet in width at the base and enclosed an area of some 2100 yards squared.<sup id="_ref-needham volume 4 part 3 43_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 4 part 3 43" title="">[6]</a></sup> In similar dimensions, the ancient <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">Chinese</a> capital for the <a href="/wiki/Zhao_(state)" id="w">State of Zhao</a>, <a href="/wiki/Handan" id="w">Handan</a> (founded in 386 BC), had walls that were again 20 meters / 65 feet wide at the base, a height of 15 meters / 50 feet tall, with two separate sides of its rectangular enclosure measured at a length of 1530 yards.<sup id="_ref-needham volume 4 part 3 43_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 4 part 3 43" title="">[6]</a></sup> The cities of the <a href="/wiki/Indus_Valley_civilization" id="w">Indus Valley civilization</a> showed less effort in constructing defenses, and likewise the <a href="/wiki/Minoan_civilization" id="w">Minoan civilization</a> on <a href="/wiki/Crete" id="w">Crete</a>. These civilizations probably relied more on the defense of their outer borders or sea shores. Unlike the ancient Minoan civilization, the <a href="/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece" id="w">Mycenaean</a> Greeks emphasized need for fortifications alongside natural defenses of mountainous terrain, such as the massive &#39;<a href="/wiki/Cyclopean" id="w">Cyclopean</a>&#39; walls built at <a href="/wiki/Mycenae" id="w">Mycenae</a> during the last half of the 2nd millennium BC.</p>

<a id="Siege_warfare_in_art" name="Siege_warfare_in_art"></a><h3>Siege warfare in art</h3>

<p>The earliest representations of siege warfare is dated to the <a href="/wiki/Protodynastic_Period_of_Egypt" id="w">Protodynastic Period of Egypt</a>, c.3000 BC. These show symbolic destruction of city walls by divine animals using hoes. The first siege equipment is known from Egyptian tomb reliefs of the 24th century BC, showing Egyptian soldiers storming <a href="/wiki/Canaan" id="w">Canaanite</a> town walls on wheeled siege ladders. Later Egyptian temple reliefs of the 13th century BC portrays the violent <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Dapur" id="w">siege of Dapur</a>, a Syrian city, with soldiers climbing scale ladders supported by archers. <a href="/wiki/Assyria" id="w">Assyrian</a> palace reliefs of the 9th to 7th centuries BC display sieges of several Near Eastern cities. Though a simple battering ram had come into use in the previous millennium, the Assyrians improved siege warfare and built huge wooden tower shaped battering rams with archers positioned on top. In ancient China, sieges of city walls (along with naval battles) were portrayed on <a href="/wiki/Bronze" id="w">bronze</a> &#39;hu&#39; vessels dated to the <a href="/wiki/Warring_States" id="w">Warring States</a> (5th century BC to 3rd century BC), like those found in <a href="/wiki/Chengdu" id="w">Chengdu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sichuan" id="w">Sichuan</a>, China in 1965.<sup id="_ref-needham volume 5 part 6 446_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 5 part 6 446" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Tactics_in_siege_warfare" name="Tactics_in_siege_warfare"></a><h3>Tactics in siege warfare</h3>

<p>The most common practice of siege warfare was however to lay siege and wait for the surrender of the enemies inside. The <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">Egyptian</a> <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Megiddo_(15th_century_BC)" id="w">siege of Megiddo</a> in the 15th century BC lasted for 7 months before its inhabitants surrendered. The <a href="/wiki/Hittites" id="w">Hittite</a> siege of a rebellious Anatolian vassal in the 14th century BC ended when the queen mother came out of the city and begged for mercy on behalf of her people. If the main objective of a campaign was not the conquest of a particular city, it could simply be passed by. The Hittite campaign against the kingdom of <a href="/wiki/Mitanni" id="w">Mitanni</a> in the 14th century BC bypassed the fortified city of <a href="/wiki/Carchemish" id="w">Carchemish</a>. When the main objective of the campaign had been fulfilled, the Hittite army returned to Carchemish and the city fell after an eight-day-siege. The well-known <a href="/wiki/Assyrian_Siege_of_Jerusalem" id="w">Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem</a> in the 8th century BC came to an end when the <a href="/wiki/Israelites" id="w">Israelites</a> bought them off with gifts and tribute, according to the <a href="/wiki/Assyria" id="w">Assyrian</a> account, or when the Assyrian camp was struck by mass death, according to the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Biblical</a> account. Due to the problem of logistics, long lasting sieges involving but a minor force could seldom be maintained.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Warring_States" id="w">Warring States</a> (<a href="/wiki/481" id="w">481</a>–<a href="/wiki/221" id="w">221</a> BC) era of China, warfare lost its honorable, gentlemen&#39;s duty that was found in the previous era of China (<a href="/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_period" id="w">Spring and Autumn period</a>), and became more practical, competitive, cut-throat, and efficient for gaining victory.<sup id="_ref-ebrey 29_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey 29" title="">[8]</a></sup> The Chinese invention of the hand-held, trigger-mechanism <a href="/wiki/Crossbow" id="w">crossbow</a> during this period revolutionized warfare, giving greater emphasis to infantry and cavalry and less to traditional <a href="/wiki/Chariot" id="w">chariot</a> Chinese warfare. The philosophically-<a href="/wiki/Pacifist" id="w">pacifist</a> <a href="/wiki/Mohist" id="w">Mohists</a> (followers of the philosopher <a href="/wiki/Mozi" id="w">Mozi</a>) of the 5th century BC believed in aiding the defensive warfare of smaller Chinese states against the hostile offensive warfare of larger domineering states. The Mohists were renowned in the smaller states (and the enemies of the larger states) for the inventions of siege machinery to scale or destroy walls. This included traction <a href="/wiki/Trebuchet" id="w">trebuchet</a> <a href="/wiki/Catapult" id="w">catapults</a>, eight foot high  <a href="/wiki/Ballista" id="w">ballistas</a>, a wheeled siege ramp with grappling hooks known as the Cloud Bridge (the protractable, folded ramp slinging forward by means of a counterweight with rope and pulley), and wheeled &#39;hook-carts&#39; used to latch large iron hooks onto the tops of walls to pull and tear them down.<sup id="_ref-turnbull 40_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-turnbull 40" title="">[9]</a></sup> When enemies attempted to dig tunnels under walls for <a href="/wiki/Mining_(military)" id="w">mining</a> or entry into the city, the defenders used large <a href="/wiki/Bellows" id="w">bellows</a> (the type the Chinese commonly used in heating up the <a href="/wiki/Blast_furnace" id="w">blast furnace</a> for smelting <a href="/wiki/Cast_iron" id="w">cast iron</a>) to pump smoke into the tunnels in order to suffocate the intruders.<sup id="_ref-ebrey 29_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey 29" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Siege_accounts" name="Siege_accounts"></a><h3>Siege accounts</h3>

<p>Although there are numerous ancient accounts of cities being sacked, few contain any clues to how this was achieved. Some popular tales existed on how the cunning heroes succeeded in their sieges. The best-known is the <a href="/wiki/Trojan_Horse" id="w">Trojan Horse</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Trojan_War" id="w">Trojan War</a>, and a similar story tells how the <a href="/wiki/Canaan" id="w">Canaanite</a> city of <a href="/wiki/Jaffa" id="w">Joppa</a> was conquered by the Egyptians in the 15th century BC. The Biblical <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Joshua" id="w">Book of Joshua</a> contains the story of the miraculous <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Jericho" id="w">Battle of Jericho</a>. A better detailed historical account from the 8th century BC, called the <a href="/wiki/Piye" id="w">Piankhi stela</a>, records how the <a href="/wiki/Kush" id="w">Nubians</a> laid siege to and conquered several Egyptian cities using <a href="/wiki/Battering_rams" id="w">battering rams</a>, <a href="/wiki/Archery" id="w">archers</a>, slingers and building <a href="/wiki/Causeways" id="w">causeways</a> across <a href="/wiki/Moats" id="w">moats</a>.</p>

<a href="/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" id="w">Alexander the Great</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Macedon" id="w">Macedonian</a> army was involved in many sieges. There are two which are of particular note: <a href="/wiki/Tyre_(Lebanon)" id="w">Tyre</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sogdian_Rock" id="w">Sogdian Rock</a>. Tyre was a <a href="/wiki/Phoenicia" id="w">Phoenician</a> island-city about 1 km from the mainland, and thought to be impregnable. The Macedonians built a mole (causeway) out to the island. It is said to have been at least 60 m (200 ft) wide. When the causeway was within artillery range of Tyre, Alexander brought up stone throwers and light catapults to bombard the city walls. The city fell to the Macedonians after a seven month siege. In complete contrast to Tyre, Sogdian Rock was captured by guile. The fortress was high up on cliffs. Alexander used commando-like tactics to scale the cliffs and capture the high ground. The demoralized defenders surrendered.</p>
<p>The importance of siege warfare in the ancient period should not be underestimated.  One of the contributing causes of <a href="/wiki/Hannibal" id="w">Hannibal</a>&#39;s inability to defeat Rome was his lack of siege train; thus, while he was able to defeat Roman armies in the field, he was unable to capture Rome itself.</p>
<p>The legionary armies of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republic" id="w">Roman Republic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Empire</a> are noted as being particularly skilled and determined in siege warfare. An astonishing number and variety of sieges, for example, formed the core of <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar" id="w">Julius Caesar&#39;s</a> mid-1st century BCE conquest of <a href="/wiki/Gaul" id="w">Gaul</a> (modern France). In his <a href="/wiki/Gallic_Wars" id="w">Gallic Wars</a>, Caesar describes how at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Alesia" id="w">Battle of Alesia</a> the <a href="/wiki/Roman_legion" id="w">Roman legions</a> created two huge fortified walls around the city. The inner <a href="/wiki/Circumvallation" id="w">circumvallation</a>, 10 miles, held in <a href="/wiki/Vercingetorix" id="w">Vercingetorix</a>&#39;s forces, while the outer <a href="/wiki/Contravallation" id="w">contravallation</a> kept relief from reaching them. The Romans held the ground in between the two walls. The besieged <a href="/wiki/Gauls" id="w">Gauls</a>, facing starvation, eventually surrendered after their relief force met defeat against Caesar&#39;s auxiliary cavalry.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Sicarii" id="w">Sicarii</a> <a href="/wiki/Zealots" id="w">Zealots</a> who defended <a href="/wiki/Masada" id="w">Masada</a> in 74 were defeated by the Roman Legions who built a ramp 100 meters high up to the fortress&#39;s west wall.</p>
<p>The universal method for defending against siege is the use of fortifications, principally walls and ditches to supplement natural features.  A sufficient supply of food and water is also important to defeat the simplest method of siege warfare: <a href="/wiki/Starvation" id="w">starvation</a>. During a siege, a surrounding army would build <a href="/wiki/Earthworks_(engineering)" id="w">earthworks</a> (a line of <a href="/wiki/Circumvallation" id="w">circumvallation</a>) to completely encircle their target, preventing food and water supplies from reaching the besieged city. If sufficiently desperate as the siege progressed, defenders and civilians might have been reduced to eating anything vaguely edible&#8212;horses, family pets, the leather from shoes, and even <a href="/wiki/Cannibalism" id="w">each other</a>. On occasion, the defenders would drive &#39;surplus&#39; civilians out to reduce the demands on stored food and water. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Disease" id="w">Disease</a> was another effective siege weapon, although the attackers were often as vulnerable as the defenders. In some instances, catapults or like weapons would fling diseased animals over city walls in an early example of <a href="/wiki/Biological_warfare" id="w">biological warfare</a>.</p>
<p><div style="wigth:300px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:300px-Trebuchet.jpg" title="Medieval [[trebuchet]]s could sling about two projectiles per hour at [[Enemy (military)|enemy]] positions."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300px-Trebuchet.jpg" alt="Medieval [[trebuchet]]s could sling about two projectiles per hour at [[Enemy (military)|enemy]] positions." title="Medieval [[trebuchet]]s could sling about two projectiles per hour at [[Enemy (military)|enemy]] positions." class="location-right type-thumbnail" width="300px" />

</p>
<p>To end a siege more rapidly various methods were developed in ancient and medieval times to counter fortifications, and a large variety of <a href="/wiki/Siege_engine" id="w">siege engines</a> were developed for use by besieging armies.  <a href="/wiki/Ladder" id="w">Ladders</a> could be used to <a href="/wiki/Escalade" id="w">escalade</a> over the defenses. <a href="/wiki/Battering_ram" id="w">Battering rams</a> and <a href="/wiki/Siege_hook" id="w">siege hooks</a> could be used to force through gates or walls, while  <a href="/wiki/Catapult" id="w">catapults</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ballista" id="w">ballistae</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trebuchet" id="w">trebuchets</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mangonel" id="w">mangonels</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Onager_(siege_weapon)" id="w">onagers</a> could be used to launch projectiles in order to break down a city&#39;s fortifications and kill its defenders. A <a href="/wiki/Siege_tower" id="w">siege tower</a> could also be used: a substantial structure built as high, or higher than the walls, it allowed the attackers to fire down upon the defenders and also advance troops to the wall with less danger than using ladders.  </p>
<p>In addition to launching projectiles at the fortifications or defenders, it was also quite common to attempt to undermine the fortifications, causing them to collapse. This could be accomplished by digging a tunnel beneath the <a href="/wiki/Foundation_(architecture)" id="w">foundations</a> of the walls, and then deliberately collapsing or exploding the tunnel. This process is known as <a href="/wiki/Mining_(military)" id="w">mining</a>. The defenders could dig counter-tunnels to cut into the attackers&#39; works and collapse them prematurely.</p>
<p>Fire was often used as a weapon when dealing with wooden fortifications.  The <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" id="w">Byzantine Empire</a> used <a href="/wiki/Greek_fire" id="w">Greek fire</a>, which contained additives that made it hard to put out. Combined with a primitive <a href="/wiki/Flamethrower" id="w">flamethrower</a>, it proved an effective offensive and defensive weapon.</p>

</p>
<p>Advances in the prosecution of sieges in ancient and medieval times naturally encouraged the development of a variety of defensive counter-measures.  In particular, <a href="/wiki/Medieval_fortification" id="w">medieval fortifications</a> became progressively stronger&#8212;for example, the advent of the <a href="/wiki/Concentric_castle" id="w">concentric castle</a> from the period of the <a href="/wiki/Crusades" id="w">Crusades</a>&#8212;and more dangerous to attackers&#8212;witness the increasing use of <a href="/wiki/Machicolation" id="w">machicolations</a> and <a href="/wiki/Murder-hole" id="w">murder-holes</a>, as well the preparation of <a href="/wiki/Boiling_oil" id="w">boiling oil</a>, molten <a href="/wiki/Lead" id="w">lead</a> or hot <a href="/wiki/Sand" id="w">sand</a>. <a href="/wiki/Arrow_slit" id="w">Arrow slits</a> (also called arrow loops or loopholes), <a href="/wiki/Sally_port" id="w">sally ports</a> (airlock like doors) for sallies, and deep water wells were also integral means of resisting siege at this time.  Particular attention would be paid to defending entrances, with gates protected by <a href="/wiki/Drawbridge" id="w">drawbridges</a>, <a href="/wiki/Portcullis" id="w">portcullises</a>  and <a href="/wiki/Barbican" id="w">barbicans</a>.  <a href="/wiki/Moat" id="w">Moats</a> and other water defenses, whether natural or augmented, were also vital to defenders.</p>
<p>In the European <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a>, virtually all large cities had city walls&#8212;<a href="/wiki/Dubrovnik" id="w">Dubrovnik</a> in <a href="/wiki/Dalmatia" id="w">Dalmatia</a> is an impressive and well-preserved example&#8212;and more important cities had <a href="/wiki/Citadel" id="w">citadels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fort" id="w">forts</a> or <a href="/wiki/Castle" id="w">castles</a>. Great effort was expended to ensure a good water supply inside the city in case of siege. In some cases, long tunnels were constructed to carry water into the city. Complex systems of underground tunnels were used for storage and communications in medieval cities like <a href="/wiki/T%C3%A1bor" id="w">Tábor</a> in <a href="/wiki/Bohemia" id="w">Bohemia</a> (similar to those used much later in <a href="/wiki/Vietnam" id="w">Vietnam</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" id="w">Vietnam War</a>).  </p>
<p>Until the invention of <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" id="w">gunpowder</a>-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the invention of gunpowder, <a href="/wiki/Cannon" id="w">cannon</a> and (in modern times) <a href="/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)" id="w">mortars</a> and <a href="/wiki/Howitzer" id="w">howitzers</a>, the traditional methods of defense became less and less effective against a determined siege.</p>
<a id="Chinese_and_Mongol_siege_warfare" name="Chinese_and_Mongol_siege_warfare"></a><h2>Chinese and Mongol siege warfare</h2>
<p>In the Middle Ages, the <a href="/wiki/Mongol_Empire" id="w">Mongol Empire</a>&#39;s campaign against <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> (then comprised of the <a href="/wiki/Western_Xia_Dynasty" id="w">Western Xia Dynasty</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jin_Dynasty%2C_1115-1234" id="w">Jin Dynasty</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Southern_Song_Dynasty" id="w">Southern Song Dynasty</a>) by <a href="/wiki/Genghis_Khan" id="w">Genghis Khan</a> until <a href="/wiki/Kublai_Khan" id="w">Kublai Khan</a> with their armies was extremely effective, allowing the Mongols to sweep through large areas. Even if they could not enter some of the more well-fortified cities, they used innovative battle tactics to grab hold of the land and the people: </p>
<dl><dd><i>&#34;By concentrating on the field armies, the strongholds had to wait. Of course, smaller fortresses, or ones easily surprised, were taken as they came along. This had two effects. First, it cut off the principal city from communicating with other cities where they might expect aid. Secondly, refugees from these smaller cities would flee to the last stronghold. The reports from these cities and the streaming hordes of refugees not only reduced the morale of the inhabitants and garrison of the principal city, it also strained their resources. Food and water reserves were taxed by the sudden influx of refugees. Soon, what was once a formidable undertaking became easy. The Mongols were then free to lay siege without interference of the field army as it had been destroyed... At the siege of <a href="/wiki/Aleppo" id="w">Aleppo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hulagu_Khan" id="w">Hulegu</a> used twenty catapults against the Bab al-Iraq (Gate of Iraq) alone. In Jûzjânî, there are several episodes in which the Mongols constructed hundreds of siege machines in order to surpass the number which the defending city possessed. While Jûzjânî surely exaggerated, the improbably high numbers which he used for both the Mongols and the defenders do give one a sense of the large numbers of machines used at a single siege.&#34;</i> <sup>1</sup></dd></dl>

Another Mongol tactic was to use catapults to launch corpses of <a href="/wiki/Bubonic_plague" id="w">plague</a> victims into besieged cities. The disease-carrying <a href="/wiki/Flea" id="w">fleas</a> from the person&#39;s body would then infest the city, and the plague would spread allowing the city to be easily captured, although this <a href="/wiki/Vector_(biology)" id="w">transmission mechanism</a> was not known at the time.</p>
<p>On the first night while laying siege to a city, the leader of the Mongol forces would lead from a white <a href="/wiki/Tent" id="w">tent</a>: if the city surrendered, all would be spared. On the second day, he would use a red tent: if the city surrendered, the men would all be killed, but the rest would be spared. On the third day, he would use a black tent: no quarter would be given.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese weren&#39;t completely defenseless, and from 1234 until 1279 AD the Southern Song Chinese held out against the enormous barrage of Mongol attacks. Much of this success in defense lay in the world&#39;s first use of <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" id="w">gunpowder</a> (ie. with early <a href="/wiki/Flamethrower" id="w">flamethrowers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grenade" id="w">grenades</a>, <a href="/wiki/Firearm" id="w">firearms</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cannon" id="w">cannons</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Land_mine" id="w">land mines</a>) to fight back against the <a href="/wiki/Khitans" id="w">Khitans</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Tanguts" id="w">Tanguts</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Jurchens" id="w">Jurchens</a>, and then the Mongols. The Chinese of the Song period also discovered the explosive potential of packing hollowed cannonball shells with gunpowder. Written later around 1350 in the <i><a href="/wiki/Jiao_Yu" id="w">Huo Long Jing</a></i>, this manuscript of <a href="/wiki/Jiao_Yu" id="w">Jiao Yu</a> recorded an earlier Song-era cast-iron cannon known as the &#39;flying-cloud thunderclap eruptor&#39; (fei yun pi-li pao). The manuscript stated that (<a href="/wiki/Wade-Giles" id="w">Wade-Giles</a> spelling):</p>
<p /><blockquote>
<p><i>The shells (phao) are made of cast iron, as large as a bowl and shaped like a ball. Inside they contain half a pound of &#39;magic&#39; gunpowder (shen huo). They are sent flying towards the enemy camp from an eruptor (mu phao); and when they get there a sound like a thunder-clap is heard, and flashes of light appear. If ten of these shells are fired successfully into the enemy camp, the whole place will be set ablaze...</i><sup id="_ref-needham volume 5 part 7 264_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 5 part 7 264" title="">[10]</a></sup>

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Ming_Dynasty" id="w">Ming Dynasty</a> (<a href="/wiki/1368" id="w">1368</a>–<a href="/wiki/1644" id="w">1644</a> AD), the Chinese were very concerned with city planning in regards to gunpowder warfare. The site for constructing the walls and the thickness of the walls in <a href="/wiki/Beijing" id="w">Beijing</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_City" id="w">Forbidden City</a> were favored by the Chinese <a href="/wiki/Yongle_Emperor" id="w">Yongle Emperor</a> (r. <a href="/wiki/1402" id="w">1402</a>–<a href="/wiki/1424" id="w">1424</a>), because they were in pristine position to resist cannon volley and were built thick enough to withstand attacks from cannon fire.</p>

<a id="Sieges_in_the_age_of_gunpowder" name="Sieges_in_the_age_of_gunpowder"></a><h2>Sieges in the age of gunpowder</h2>
<p>The introduction of <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" id="w">gunpowder</a> and the use of <a href="/wiki/Cannon" id="w">cannons</a> brought about a new age in siege warfare. Cannons were first used in <a href="/wiki/Song_Dynasty" id="w">Song Dynasty</a> China during the early 13th century, but did not become significant weapons for another 150 years or so. By the 16th century, they were an essential and regularized part of any campaigning army, or castle&#39;s defenses.</p>
<p>The greatest advantage of cannons over other siege weapons was the ability to fire a heavier projectile, further, faster and more often than previous weapons. Thus, &#39;old fashioned&#39; walls&#8212;that is high and, relatively, thin&#8212;were excellent targets and, over time, easily demolished. In 1453, the great walls of <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" id="w">Constantinople</a> were broken through in just six weeks by the 62 cannon of <a href="/wiki/Mehmet_II" id="w">Mehmet II</a>&#39;s army.</p>
<p>However, new fortifications, designed to withstand gunpowder weapons, were soon constructed throughout Europe. During the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" id="w">Renaissance</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Early_Modern" id="w">Early Modern</a> period, siege warfare continued to dominate the conduct of war in Europe. </p>
<p>Once siege guns were developed the techniques for assaulting a town or a fortress became well known and ritualized. The attacking army would surround a town. Then the town would be asked to surrender. If they did not comply the besieging army would surround the town with temporary fortifications to stop <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sally">sallies</a> from the stronghold or relief getting in. The attackers would then build a length of trenches parallel to the defences and just out of range of the defending artillery. They would then dig a trench towards the town in a <a href="/wiki/Zigzag" id="w">zigzag</a> pattern so that it could not be <a href="/wiki/Enfilade" id="w">enfiladed</a> by defending fire. Once within artillery range another parallel trench would be dug with gun emplacements. If necessary using the first artillery fire for cover this process would be repeated until guns were close enough to be laid accurately to make a breach in the fortifications. So that the <a href="/wiki/Forlorn_hope" id="w">forlorn hope</a> and support troops could get close enough to exploit the breach more zigzag trenches could be dug even closer to the walls with more parallel trenches to protect and conceal the attacking troops.  After each step in the process the besiegers would ask the besieged to surrender. If the forlorn hope stormed the breach successfully the defenders could expect no mercy.</p>
<a id="Emerging_theories_on_improving_fortifications" name="Emerging_theories_on_improving_fortifications"></a><h3>Emerging theories on improving fortifications</h3>
<p>The castles that in earlier years had been formidable obstacles were easily breached by the new weapons. For example, in Spain, the newly equipped army of <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_and_Isabella" id="w">Ferdinand and Isabella</a> was able to conquer <a href="/wiki/Moors" id="w">Moorish</a> strongholds in <a href="/wiki/Granada" id="w">Granada</a> in 1482&#8211;92 that had held out for centuries before the invention of cannons.</p>

</p>
<p>In the early 15th century, Italian architect <a href="/wiki/Leon_Battista_Alberti" id="w">Leon Battista Alberti</a> wrote a treatise entitled <i>De Re aedificatoria</i> which theorized methods of building fortifications capable of withstanding the new guns. He proposed that walls be &#34;built in uneven lines, like the teeth of a saw.&#34; He proposed star-shaped fortresses with low thick walls.</p>
<p>However, few rulers paid any attention to his theories. A few towns in Italy began building in the new style late in the 1480s, but it was only with the French invasion of the Italian peninsula in 1494&#8211;95 that the new fortifications were built on a large scale. <a href="/wiki/Charles_VIII_of_France" id="w">Charles VIII</a> invaded Italy with an army of 18,000 men and a horse-drawn <a href="/wiki/Siege-train" id="w">siege-train</a>. As a result he could defeat virtually any city or state, no matter how well defended. In a panic, military strategy was completely rethought throughout the Italian states of the time, with a strong emphasis on the new fortifications that could withstand a modern siege.</p>
<a id="New_styles_of_fortresses_employed" name="New_styles_of_fortresses_employed"></a><h3>New styles of fortresses employed</h3>
<p>The most effective way to protect walls against cannon fire proved to be depth (increasing the width of the defenses) and angles (ensuring that attackers could only fire on walls at an oblique angle, not square on). Initially walls were lowered and backed, in front and behind, with earth. Towers were reformed into triangular bastions.</p>
<p>This design matured into the <i><a href="/wiki/Trace_italienne" id="w">trace italienne</a></i>. Star-shaped fortresses surrounding towns and even cities with outlying defenses proved very difficult to capture, even for a well equipped army. Fortresses built in this style throughout the 16th century did not become fully obsolete until the 19th century, and were still in use throughout <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> (though modified for 20th century warfare).</p>
<p>However, the cost of building such vast modern fortifications was incredibly high, and was often too much for individual cities to undertake. Many were bankrupted in the process of building them; others, such as <a href="/wiki/Siena" id="w">Siena</a>, spent so much money on fortifications that they were unable to maintain their armies properly, and so lost their wars anyway. Nonetheless, innumerable large and impressive fortresses were built throughout northern Italy in the first decades of the 16th century to resist repeated French invasions that became known as the <a href="/wiki/Italian_Wars" id="w">Italian Wars</a>. Many stand to this day.</p>
<p>In the 1530s and 1540s, the new style of fortification began to spread out of Italy into the rest of Europe, particularly to France, the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a>, and Spain. Italian engineers were in enormous demand throughout Europe, especially in war-torn areas such as the Netherlands, which became dotted by towns encircled in modern fortifications. For many years, defensive and offensive tactics were well balanced leading to protracted and costly wars such as Europe had never known, involving more and more planning and government involvement.</p>
<p>The new fortresses ensured that war rarely extended beyond a series of sieges. Because the new fortresses could easily hold 10,000 men, an attacking army could not ignore a powerfully fortified position without serious risk of counterattack. As a result, virtually all towns had to be taken, and that was usually a long, drawn-out affair, potentially lasting from several months to years, while the members of the town were starved to death. Most battles in this period were between besieging armies and relief columns sent to rescue the besieged.</p>
<a id="Marshal_Vauban" name="Marshal_Vauban"></a><h3>Marshal Vauban</h3>
<p><div style="wigth:250px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:250px-Vauban-fortress.jpg" title="[[Vauban]] refined siege warfare by designing fortresses to withstand attacks and planning attacks."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/250px-Vauban-fortress.jpg" alt="[[Vauban]] refined siege warfare by designing fortresses to withstand attacks and planning attacks." title="[[Vauban]] refined siege warfare by designing fortresses to withstand attacks and planning attacks." class="location-right type-thumbnail" width="250px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbnailcaption"><a href="/wiki/Vauban" id="w">Vauban</a> refined siege warfare by designing fortresses to withstand attacks and planning attacks.</div></div>
</p>
<p>At the end of the 17th century, Marshal <a href="/wiki/Vauban" id="w">Vauban</a>, a <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a> military engineer, developed modern fortification to its pinnacle, refining siege warfare without fundamentally altering it: ditches would be dug; walls would be protected by <a href="/wiki/Glacis" id="w">glacis</a>; and <a href="/wiki/Bastion" id="w">bastions</a> would <a href="/wiki/Enfilade" id="w">enfilade</a> an attacker.  He was also a master of planning sieges himself.  Before Vauban, sieges had been somewhat slapdash operations.  Vauban refined besieging to a science with a methodical process that, if uninterrupted, would break even the strongest fortifications.</p>
<p>Examples of Vauban-style fortresses in <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a> include <a href="/wiki/Fort_McHenry" id="w">Fort McHenry</a> in <a href="/wiki/Baltimore%2C_Maryland" id="w">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fort_Ticonderoga" id="w">Fort Ticonderoga</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_State" id="w">New York State</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Citadelle_of_Quebec" id="w">La Citadelle</a> in <a href="/wiki/Quebec_City" id="w">Quebec City</a>.</p>
<p>Planning and maintaining a siege is just as difficult as fending one off.  A besieging army must be prepared to repel both <a href="/wiki/Sortie" id="w">sorties</a> from the besieged area and also any attack that may try to relieve the defenders.  It was thus usual to construct lines of trenches and defenses facing in both directions.  The outermost lines, known as the lines of <a href="/wiki/Contravallation" id="w">contravallation</a>, would surround the entire besieging army and protect it from attackers.  This would be the first construction effort of a besieging army, built soon after a fortress or city had been invested. A line of <a href="/wiki/Circumvallation" id="w">circumvallation</a> would also be constructed, facing in towards the besieged area, to protect against sorties by the defenders and to prevent the besieged from escaping.</p>
<p>The next line, which Vauban usually placed at about 600 meters from the target, would contain the main batteries of heavy cannons so that they could hit the target without being vulnerable themselves. Once this line was established, work crews would move forward creating another line at 250 meters.  This line contained smaller guns.  The final line would be constructed only 30 to 60 meters from the fortress.  This line would contain the <a href="/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)" id="w">mortars</a> and would act as a <a href="/wiki/Staging_area" id="w">staging area</a> for attack parties once the walls were breached.  It would also be from there that miners working to undermine the fortress would operate.</p>
<p>The trenches connecting the various lines of the besiegers could not be built perpendicular to the walls of the fortress, as the defenders would have a clear line of fire along the whole trench.  Thus, these lines (known as <a href="/wiki/Sapping" id="w">saps</a>) needed to be sharply jagged.</p>
<p>Another element of a fortress was the <a href="/wiki/Citadel" id="w">citadel</a>. Usually a citadel was a &#34;mini fortress&#34; within the larger fortress, sometimes designed as a last bastion of defense, but more often as a means of protecting the garrison from potential revolt in the city. The citadel was used in wartime and peacetime to keep the residents of the city in line.</p>
<p>As in ages past, most sieges were decided with very little fighting between the opposing armies. An attacker&#39;s army was poorly served incurring the high casualties that a direct assault on a fortress would entail. Usually they would wait until supplies inside the fortifications were exhausted or disease had weakened the defenders to the point that they were willing to surrender. At the same time, diseases, especially <a href="/wiki/Typhus" id="w">typhus</a> were a constant danger to the encamped armies outside the fortress, and often forced a premature retreat. Sieges were often won by the army that lasted the longest.</p>
<p>An important element of <a href="/wiki/Strategy" id="w">strategy</a> for the besieging army was whether or not to allow the encamped city to surrender. Usually it was preferable to graciously allow a <a href="/wiki/Surrender_(military)" id="w">surrender</a>, both to save on casualties, and to set an example for future defending cities. A city that was allowed to surrender with minimal loss of life was much better off than a city that held out for a long time and was brutally butchered at the end. Moreover, if an attacking army had a reputation of killing and pillaging regardless of a surrender, then other cities&#39; defensive efforts would be redoubled.</p>
<a id="Advent_of_mobile_warfare" name="Advent_of_mobile_warfare"></a><h3>Advent of mobile warfare</h3>
<p>Siege warfare dominated in Western Europe for most of the <a href="/wiki/17th_century" id="w">seventeenth</a> and <a href="/wiki/18th_century" id="w">eighteenth</a> centuries.  An entire campaign, or longer, could be used in a single siege (for example, <a href="/wiki/Ostend" id="w">Ostend</a> in 1601&#8211;04; <a href="/wiki/La_Rochelle" id="w">La Rochelle</a> in 1627&#8211;28). This resulted in extremely prolonged conflicts. The balance was that while siege warfare was extremely expensive and very slow, it was very successful&#8212;or, at least, more so than encounters in the field. Battles arose through clashes between besiegers and relieving armies, but the principle was a slow grinding victory by the greater economic power. The relatively rare attempts at forcing pitched battles (<a href="/wiki/Gustavus_Adolphus" id="w">Gustavus Adolphus</a> in 1630; the French against the Dutch in 1672 or 1688) were almost always expensive failures. In the early nineteenth century, two factors changed this method of warfare.</p>
<p>The exception to this rule were the English. During the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" id="w">English Civil War</a> anything which tended to prolong the struggle, or seemed like want of energy and avoidance of a decision, was bitterly resented by the men of both sides. In France and Germany, the prolongation of a war meant continued employment for the soldiers, but in England:
</p><dl><dd>&#34;we never encamped or entrenched... or lay fenced with rivers or defiles. Here were no leaguers in the field, as at the story of <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Nuremberg" id="w">Nuremberg</a>, &#39;neither had our soldiers any tents, or what they call heavy baggage.&#39; Twas the general maxim of the war: Where is the enemy? Let us go and fight them. Or... if the enemy was coming... Why, what should be done! Draw out into the fields and fight them.&#34;<sup id="_ref-EB-GR-RP-Armies_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EB-GR-RP-Armies" title="">[11]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>This passage from the <i>Memoirs of a Cavalier</i>,<sup id="_ref-defoe_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-defoe" title="">[12]</a></sup> ascribed to <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Defoe" id="w">Daniel Defoe</a>, though not contemporary evidence, is an admirable summary of the character of the Civil War. Even when in the end a regular professional army developed, the original decision-compelling spirit permeated the whole organisation as was seen when pitched against regular professional continental troops the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Dunes_(1658)" id="w">Battle of the Dunes</a> during the <a href="/wiki/English_Interregnum" id="w">Interregnum</a>.<sup id="_ref-EB-GR-RP-Armies_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EB-GR-RP-Armies" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars" id="w">French Revolutionary</a> and <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" id="w">Napoleonic Wars</a>, new techniques stressed the division of armies into all-arms corps that would march separately and only come together on the battlefield. The less concentrated army could now live off the country and move more rapidly over a larger number of roads. Fortresses commanding lines of communication could be bypassed and would no longer stop an invasion. Since armies could not live off the land indefinitely, <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte" id="w">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> always sought a quick end to any conflict by pitched battle.

 in artillery made previously impregnable defenses useless.  For example, the walls of <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Vienna" id="w">Vienna</a> that had held off the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" id="w">Turks</a> in the mid-seventeenth century were no obstacle to <a href="/wiki/Napoleon" id="w">Napoleon</a> in the late eighteenth.

The great Swedish white-elephant fortress of <a href="/wiki/Karlsborg_Fortress" id="w">Karlsborg</a> was built in the tradition of Vauban and intended as a reserve capital for Sweden, but it was obsolete before it was completed in 1869. (It was said that the Prussian General <a href="/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder" id="w">von Moltke</a>, a great exponent of the art of mobile warfare, smiled only twice in his life; when he saw the fortress of Karlsborg, and when his wife&#39;s mother died.)</p>
<p>Railways, when they were introduced, made possible the movement and supply of larger armies than those that fought in the Napoleonic Wars. It also reintroduced siege warfare, as armies seeking to use railway lines in enemy territory were forced to capture fortresses which blocked these lines. During the <a href="/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War" id="w">Franco-Prussian War</a>, the battlefield front-lines moved rapidly through France. However, the Prussian and other German armies were delayed for months at the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Metz" id="w">Siege of Metz</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Paris" id="w">Siege of Paris</a>, due to the greatly increased firepower of the defending infantry, and the principle of detached or semi-detached forts with heavy-caliber <a href="/wiki/Artillery" id="w">artillery</a>. This resulted in the later construction of fortress works across Europe such as the massive fortifications at <a href="/wiki/Verdun-sur-Meuse" id="w">Verdun</a>. It also led to the introduction of tactics which sought to induce surrender by bombarding the civilian population within a fortress rather than the defending works themselves.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1854-1855)" id="w">Siege of Sevastopol</a> (1854&#8211;1855) during the <a href="/wiki/Crimean_War" id="w">Crimean War</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Petersburg" id="w">Petersburg</a>  (1864&#8211;1865) during the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a> showed that modern citadels, when improved by improvised defences, could still resist an enemy for many months. The <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Pleven" id="w">Siege of Pleven</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1877%E2%80%931878)" id="w">Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)</a> proved that hastily-constructed field defences could resist attacks prepared without proper resources, and were a portent of the trench warfare of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>.</p>
<p>Advances in firearms technology without the necessary advances in battlefield communications gradually led to the defense again gaining the ascendancy. An example of siege during this time, prolonged during 337 days due to the isolation of the surrounded troops, was the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Baler" id="w">Siege of Baler</a>, in which a reduced group of <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spanish</a> soldiers, was besieged in a small church by the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippine</a> rebels, in the course of the <a href="/wiki/Philippine_Revolution" id="w">Philippine Revolution</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Spanish-American_War" id="w">Spanish-American War</a>, until months after the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1898)" id="w">Treaty of Paris</a>, the end of the conflict.</p>

Mainly as a result of the increasing firepower (such as <a href="/wiki/Machine_gun" id="w">machine guns</a>) available to defensive forces, <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">First World War</a> <a href="/wiki/Trench_warfare" id="w">trench warfare</a> briefly revived a form of siege warfare.  Although siege warfare had moved out from an urban setting because city walls had become ineffective against modern weapons, trench warfare was nonetheless able to utilize many of the techniques of siege warfare in its prosecution (<a href="/wiki/Sapping" id="w">sapping</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mining_(military)" id="w">mining</a>, <a href="/wiki/Artillery" id="w">barrage</a> and, of course, <a href="/wiki/Attrition_warfare" id="w">attrition</a>) but on a much larger scale and on a greatly extended front.  The development of the armoured <a href="/wiki/Tank" id="w">tank</a> and improved <a href="/wiki/Infantry" id="w">infantry</a> <a href="/wiki/Military_tactics" id="w">tactics</a> at the end of World War I swung the pendulum back in favour of maneuver.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Blitzkrieg" id="w">Blitzkrieg</a> of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">Second World War</a> truly showed that fixed fortifications are easily defeated by maneuver instead of frontal assault or long sieges. The great <a href="/wiki/Maginot_Line" id="w">Maginot Line</a> was bypassed and battles that would have taken weeks of siege could now be avoided with the careful application of air power (such as the German <a href="/wiki/Paratrooper" id="w">paratrooper</a> capture of <a href="/wiki/Fort_Eben-Emael" id="w">Fort Eben-Emael</a>, Belgium, early in World War II). 
<div style="wigth:200px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:200px-Blokada_01.jpg" title="In the [[Siege of Leningrad]] about one million civilians died of starvation and stress."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200px-Blokada_01.jpg" alt="In the [[Siege of Leningrad]] about one million civilians died of starvation and stress." title="In the [[Siege of Leningrad]] about one million civilians died of starvation and stress." class="location-right type-thumb" width="200px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">In the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Leningrad" id="w">Siege of Leningrad</a> about one million civilians died of starvation and stress.</div></div>

The most important siege was the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Leningrad" id="w">Siege of Leningrad</a>, that lasted over 29 months, about half of the duration of the entire Second World War. Along with the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad" id="w">Battle of Stalingrad</a>, the Siege of Leningrad on the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" id="w">Eastern Front</a> was the deadliest siege of a city in history. In the west apart from the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic_(1939%E2%80%931945)" id="w">Battle of the Atlantic</a> the sieges were not on the same scale as those on the European Eastern front; however, there were several notable or critical sieges: the island of <a href="/wiki/Malta" id="w">Malta</a> for which the population won the <a href="/wiki/George_Cross" id="w">George Cross</a>, <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Tobruk" id="w">Tobruk</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Monte_Cassino" id="w">Monte Cassino</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/South-East_Asian_Theatre_of_World_War_II" id="w">South-East Asian Theatre</a> there was the siege of <a href="/wiki/Singapore" id="w">Singapore</a> and in the <a href="/wiki/Burma_Campaign" id="w">Burma Campaign</a> sieges of <a href="/wiki/Myitkyina" id="w">Myitkyina</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Admin_Box" id="w">Admin Box</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Tennis_Court" id="w">Battle of the Tennis Court</a> which was the high water mark for the Japanese advance into <a href="/wiki/British_India" id="w">India</a>.  </p>
<p>The air supply methods which were developed and used extensively in the Burma Campaign for supplying the <a href="/wiki/Chindits" id="w">Chindits</a> and other units, including those in sieges such as <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Imphal" id="w">Imphal</a>, as well as flying <a href="/wiki/The_Hump" id="w">the Hump</a> into China, allowed the western powers to develop air lift expertise which would prove vital during the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" id="w">Cold War</a> <a href="/wiki/Berlin_Blockade" id="w">Berlin Blockade</a>. </p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" id="w">Vietnam War</a> the battles of <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Dien_Bien_Phu" id="w">Dien Bien Phu</a> (1954) and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Khe_Sanh" id="w">Khe Sanh</a> (1968) possessed siege-like characteristics. In both cases, the <a href="/wiki/Vietminh" id="w">Vietminh</a> and <a href="/wiki/National_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_South_Vietnam" id="w">NLF</a> were able to cut off the opposing army by capturing the surrounding rugged terrain. At Dien Bien Phu, the French were unable to use air power to overcome the siege and were defeated. However, at Khe Sanh a mere 14 years later, advances in air power allowed the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> to withstand the siege.  The resistance of US forces was assisted by the <a href="/wiki/North_Vietnamese_Army" id="w">PAVN</a> and <a href="/wiki/National_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_South_Vietnam" id="w">PLAF</a> forces&#39; decision to use the Khe Sanh siege as strategic distraction to allow their mobile warfare offensive, the first <a href="/wiki/Tet_offensive" id="w">Tet offensive</a> to unfold securely.  The Siege of Khe Sanh displays typical features of modern sieges, as the defender has greater capacity to withstand siege, the attacker&#39;s main aim is to bottle operational forces, or create a strategic distraction, rather than take a siege to conclusion. </p>

<a id="Police_actions" name="Police_actions"></a><h2>Police actions</h2>
<p>Despite the overwhelming might of the modern state, siege tactics continue to be employed in <a href="/wiki/Police" id="w">police</a> conflicts.  This has been due to a number of factors, primarily risk to life, whether that of the police, the besieged, bystanders or <a href="/wiki/Hostage" id="w">hostages</a>.  Police make use of trained <a href="/wiki/Negotiation" id="w">negotiators</a>, <a href="/wiki/Psychology" id="w">psychologists</a> and, if necessary, force, generally being able to rely on the support of their nation&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Armed_forces" id="w">armed forces</a> if required. </p>
<p>One of the complications facing police in a siege involving hostages is the <a href="/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome" id="w">Stockholm syndrome</a> where sometimes hostages can develop a sympathetic rapport with their captors. If this helps keep them safe from harm this is considered to be a good thing, but there have been cases where hostages have tried to shield the captors during an assault or refused to co-operate with the authorities in bringing prosecutions.</p>
<p>The 1993 <a href="/wiki/Waco_Siege" id="w">police siege</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Branch_Davidian" id="w">Branch Davidian</a> church in <a href="/wiki/Waco%2C_Texas" id="w">Waco</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a>, lasted 51 days, an atypically long police siege. Unlike traditional military sieges, police sieges tend to last for hours or days rather than weeks, months or years.</p>
<p>In Britain if the siege involves perpetrators who are considered by the British Government to be terrorists, then if an assault is to take place,  the civilian authorities hand command and control over to the military. The threat of such an action ended the <a href="/wiki/Balcombe_Street_Siege" id="w">Balcombe Street Siege</a> in 1975 but the <a href="/wiki/Iranian_Embassy_Siege" id="w">Iranian Embassy Siege</a> in 1980 ended in a military assault and the death of all but one of the hostage takers.</p>
