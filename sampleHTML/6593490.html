On February 19th he was axed while asleep by a fellow Azerbaijani participant Ramil Safarov. The murder occurred at 5 o&#39;clock in the morning, while the victim was asleep. Gurgen&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Hungary" id="w">Hungarian</a> roommate, Balázs Kuti, remembers that on the evening of February 18th Kuti had tea and went to bed, as he had fever, while Gurgen Margaryan kept on studying. Around 9:30 p.m. Margaryan went to visit another program participant from Armenia—<a href="/wiki/Hayk_Makuchyan" id="w">Hayk Makuchyan</a>—who was staying in another room.</p>
<p>Balazs does not remember when Gurgen came back, but early in the morning he felt that someone turned on the light. He thought it was Gurgen returning to the room, but after hearing some muffled sounds, he turned his head away from the wall and saw the Azerbaijani officer standing by Gurgen’s bed, with a long axe in his hands.
