A <b>lawyer</b>, according to <i><a href="/wiki/Black%26%2339%3Bs_Law_Dictionary" id="w">Black&#39;s Law Dictionary</a></i>, is &#34;a person learned in the law; as an <a href="/wiki/Attorney_at_law" id="w">attorney</a>, counsel or solicitor; a person licensed to practice law.&#34;<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Law" id="w">Law</a> is the system of rules of conduct established by the <a href="/wiki/Sovereign" id="w">sovereign</a> <a href="/wiki/Government" id="w">government</a> of a society to correct wrongs, maintain stability, and deliver <a href="/wiki/Justice" id="w">justice</a>.  Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who retain (i.e., hire) lawyers to perform legal services.</p>
<p>The role of the lawyer varies significantly across legal jurisdictions, and therefore can be treated here in only the most general terms.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  More information is available in country-specific articles (see below).  </p>
<a id="Terminology" name="Terminology"></a><h1>Terminology</h1>
<p>In practice, legal jurisdictions exercise their right to determine who is recognized as being a lawyer; as a result, the meaning of the term &#34;lawyer&#34; may vary from place to place.</p>

<ul>
<li>In <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, the word &#34;lawyer&#34; is used to refer to both <a href="/wiki/Barrister" id="w">barristers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Solicitor" id="w">solicitors</a> (whether in private practice or practising as corporate in-house counsel) but not people who do not practice the law.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>In <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">Britain</a>, &#34;lawyer&#34; is used loosely to refer to a broad variety of law-trained persons.  It includes practitioners such as <a href="/wiki/Barrister" id="w">barristers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solicitor" id="w">solicitors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Legal_executive" id="w">legal executives</a> and <a href="/wiki/Licensed_conveyancer" id="w">licensed conveyancers</a>; and people who are involved with the law but do not practice it on behalf of individual clients, such as judges, court clerks, and drafters of legislation.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>In <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, the word &#34;lawyer&#34; only refers to individuals who have been called to the bar or have qualified as civil law notaries in the province of <a href="/wiki/Quebec" id="w">Quebec</a>. Common law lawyers in Canada may also be known as &#34;barristers and solicitors&#34;, but should not be referred to as &#34;attorneys&#34;, since that term has a different meaning in Canadian usage.  However, in Quebec, civil law advocates (or <i>avocats</i> in French) often call themselves &#34;attorney&#34; and sometimes &#34;barrister and solicitor&#34;.  </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" id="w">United States of America</a>, the term generally refers to <a href="/wiki/Attorney_at_law" id="w">attorneys</a> who may <a href="/wiki/Practice_of_law" id="w">practice law</a>.  </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Other nations tend to have comparable terms for the analogous concept.</li></ul>
<a id="Responsibilities" name="Responsibilities"></a><h1>Responsibilities</h1>

<p>In most countries, particularly <a href="/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)" id="w">civil law</a> countries, there has been a tradition of giving many legal tasks to a variety of <a href="/wiki/Civil_law_notary" id="w">civil law notaries</a>, clerks, and scriveners.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  These countries do not have &#34;lawyers&#34; in the American sense, insofar as that term refers to a single type of general-purpose legal services provider;<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> rather, their legal professions consist of a large number of law-trained persons, known as <a href="/wiki/Jurist" id="w">jurists</a>, of which only some are advocates who are licensed to practice in the courts.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  It is difficult to formulate accurate generalizations that cover all the countries with multiple legal professions, because each country has traditionally had its own peculiar method of dividing up legal work among all its different types of legal professionals.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Notably, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, the mother of the <a href="/wiki/Common_law" id="w">common law</a> jurisdictions, emerged from the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Ages" id="w">Dark Ages</a> with similar complexity in its legal professions, but then evolved by the 19th century to a single dichotomy between <a href="/wiki/Barrister" id="w">barristers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Solicitor" id="w">solicitors</a>.  An equivalent dichotomy developed between advocates and procurators in some civil law countries, though these two types did not always monopolize the practice of law as much as barristers and solicitors, in that they always coexisted with civil law notaries.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>   </p>
<p>Several countries that originally had two or more legal professions have since <a href="/wiki/Fused_profession" id="w">&#39;&#39;fused&#39;&#39;</a> or <i>united</i> their professions into a single type of lawyer.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>  Most countries in this category are <a href="/wiki/Common_law" id="w">common law</a> countries, though <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, a civil law country, merged together its jurists in 1990 and 1991 in response to Anglo-American competition.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>  
In countries with fused professions, a lawyer is usually permitted to carry out all or nearly all the responsibilities listed below.  </p>
<a id="Oral_argument_in_the_courts" name="Oral_argument_in_the_courts"></a><h2>Oral argument in the courts</h2>
<p>Arguing a client&#39;s case before a <a href="/wiki/Judge" id="w">judge</a> or <a href="/wiki/Jury" id="w">jury</a> in a court of law is the traditional province of the barrister in England. However, the boundary between barristers and solicitors has evolved. In England today, the barrister monopoly covers only appellate courts, and barristers must compete directly with solicitors in many trial courts.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> In countries like the United States that have fused legal professions, there are <a href="/wiki/Trial_lawyer" id="w">trial lawyers</a> who specialize in trying cases in court, but trial lawyers do not have a <i>de jure</i> monopoly like barristers.</p>
<p>In some countries, litigants have the option of arguing <i><a href="/wiki/Pro_se" id="w">pro se</a></i>, or on their own behalf.  It is common for litigants to appear unrepresented before certain courts like <a href="/wiki/Small_claims_court" id="w">small claims courts</a>; indeed, many such courts do not allow lawyers to speak for their clients, in an effort to save money for all participants in a small case.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> In other countries, like <a href="/wiki/Venezuela" id="w">Venezuela</a>, no one may appear before a judge unless represented by a lawyer.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> The advantage of the latter regime is that lawyers are familiar with the court&#39;s customs and procedures, and make the legal system more efficient for all involved. Unrepresented parties often damage their own credibility or slow the court down as a result of their inexperience.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Research_and_drafting_of_court_papers" name="Research_and_drafting_of_court_papers"></a><h2>Research and drafting of court papers</h2>
<p>Often, lawyers brief a court in writing on the issues in a case before the issues can be orally argued.  They may have to perform extensive research into relevant facts and law while drafting legal papers and preparing for oral argument.  </p>
<p>In England, a solicitor gets the facts of the case from the client and briefs a barrister in writing. The barrister then researches, drafts, and files the necessary court pleadings, and orally argues the case.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>, the procurator merely signs and presents the papers to the court, but it is the advocate who drafts the papers and argues the case.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>In some countries, like <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Scrivener" id="w">scrivener</a> or clerk may fill out court forms and draft simple papers for lay persons who cannot afford or do not need attorneys, and advise them on how to manage and argue their own cases.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Advocacy_(written_and_oral)_in_administrative_hearings" name="Advocacy_(written_and_oral)_in_administrative_hearings"></a><h2>Advocacy (written and oral) in administrative hearings</h2>

<p>In most developed countries, the legislature has granted <a href="/wiki/Original_jurisdiction" id="w">original jurisdiction</a> over highly technical matters to <a href="/wiki/Executive_branch" id="w">executive branch</a> administrative agencies which oversee such things.  As a result, some lawyers have become specialists in <a href="/wiki/Administrative_law" id="w">administrative law</a>. In a few countries, there is a special category of jurists with a monopoly over this form of advocacy; for example, France formerly had <i>conseil juridiques</i> (who were merged into the main legal profession in 1991).<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup>  In other countries, like the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, lawyers have been effectively barred by statute from certain types of administrative hearings in order to preserve their informality.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="Client_intake_and_counseling_(with_regard_to_pending_litigation)" name="Client_intake_and_counseling_(with_regard_to_pending_litigation)"></a><h2>Client intake and counseling (with regard to pending litigation)</h2>
<p>In England, only solicitors were traditionally in direct contact with the client.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup>   The solicitor retained a barrister if one was necessary and acted as an intermediary between the barrister and the client. In most cases a barrister would be obliged, under what is known as the &#34;cab rank rule&#34;, to accept instructions for a case in an area in which they held themselves out as practising, at a court at which they normally appeared and at their usual rates.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Legal_advice_(with_regard_to_all_legal_matters)" name="Legal_advice_(with_regard_to_all_legal_matters)"></a><h2>Legal advice (with regard to all legal matters)</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Legal_advice" id="w">Legal advice</a> is the application of abstract principles of law to the concrete facts of the client&#39;s case in order to advise the client about what they should do next.  In many countries, only a properly licensed lawyer may provide legal advice to clients for good <a href="/wiki/Consideration" id="w">consideration</a>, even if no lawsuit is contemplated or is in progress.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> Therefore, even conveyancers and corporate in-house counsel must first get a license to practice, though they may actually spend very little of their careers in court.  Failure to obey such a rule is the crime of <a href="/wiki/Unauthorized_practice_of_law" id="w">unauthorized practice of law</a>.</p>
<p>In other countries, jurists who hold law degrees are allowed to provide legal advice to individuals or to corporations, and it is irrelevant if they lack a license and cannot appear in court.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Some countries go further; in <a href="/wiki/England_and_Wales" id="w">England and Wales</a>, there is <i>no</i> general prohibition on the giving of legal advice.  Sometimes civil law notaries are allowed to give legal advice, as in <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a>.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup>
In many countries, non-jurist accountants may provide what is technically legal advice in tax and accounting matters.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Protecting_intellectual_property" name="Protecting_intellectual_property"></a><h2>Protecting intellectual property</h2>
<p>In virtually all countries, <a href="/wiki/Patent" id="w">patents</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trademark" id="w">trademarks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Industrial_design_rights" id="w">industrial designs</a> and other forms of <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property" id="w">intellectual property</a> must be formally registered with a government agency in order to receive maximum protection under the law.  The division of such work among lawyers, licensed non-lawyer jurists/agents, and ordinary clerks or scriveners varies greatly from one country to the next.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Negotiating_and_drafting_contracts" name="Negotiating_and_drafting_contracts"></a><h2>Negotiating and drafting contracts</h2>
<p>In some countries, the negotiating and drafting of contracts is considered to be similar to the provision of legal advice, so that it is subject to the licensing requirement explained above.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> In others, jurists or notaries may negotiate or draft contracts.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Lawyers in some civil law countries traditionally deprecated &#34;transactional law&#34; or &#34;business law&#34; as beneath them.  French law firms developed transactional departments only in the 1990s when they started to lose business to international firms based in the United States and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> (where solicitors have always done transactional work).<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup>  </p>
<a id="Conveyancing" name="Conveyancing"></a><h2>Conveyancing</h2>
<p>Conveyancing is the drafting of the documents necessary for the transfer of <a href="/wiki/Real_property" id="w">real property</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Deed" id="w">deeds</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mortgage" id="w">mortgages</a>.  In some jurisdictions, all <a href="/wiki/Real_estate" id="w">real estate</a> transactions must be carried out by a lawyer (or a solicitor where that distinction still exists).<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Such a monopoly is quite valuable from the lawyer&#39;s point of view; historically, conveyancing accounted for about half of English solicitors&#39; income (though this has since changed),<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> and a 1978 study showed that conveyancing &#34;accounts for as much as 80 percent of solicitor-client contact in <a href="/wiki/New_South_Wales" id="w">New South Wales</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup>  In most common law jurisdictions outside of the United States, this monopoly arose from an 1804 law<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> that was introduced by <a href="/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger" id="w">William Pitt the Younger</a> as a <i><a href="/wiki/Quid_pro_quo" id="w">quid pro quo</a></i> for the raising of fees on the certification of legal professionals such as barristers, solicitors, attorneys and notaries.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>In others, the use of a lawyer is optional and banks, title companies, or <a href="/wiki/Realtor" id="w">realtors</a> may be used instead.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> In some civil law jurisdictions, real estate transactions are handled by civil law notaries.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/England_and_Wales" id="w">England and Wales</a> a special class of legal professional, the <a href="/wiki/Licensed_Conveyancer" id="w">Licensed Conveyancer</a> is also allowed to carry out conveyancing services for reward.</p>
<a id="Carrying_out_the_intent_of_the_deceased" name="Carrying_out_the_intent_of_the_deceased"></a><h2>Carrying out the intent of the deceased</h2>
<p>In many countries, only lawyers have the legal authority to do drafting of <a href="/wiki/Will_(law)" id="w">wills</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trust_(property)" id="w">trusts</a>, and any other documents that ensure the efficient disposition of a person&#39;s property after death.  In some civil law countries this responsibility is handled by civil law notaries.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>In the United States, the estates of the deceased must be administered by a court through <a href="/wiki/Probate" id="w">probate</a>.  American lawyers have a profitable monopoly on dispensing advice about probate law (which has been heavily criticized).<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Prosecution_and_defense_of_criminal_suspects" name="Prosecution_and_defense_of_criminal_suspects"></a><h2> Prosecution and defense of criminal suspects </h2>
<p>In many civil law countries, <a href="/wiki/Prosecutor" id="w">prosecutors</a> are trained and employed as part of the judiciary; they are law-trained jurists, but may not necessarily be lawyers in the sense that the word is used in the common law world.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup>  In common law countries, prosecutors are usually lawyers holding regular licenses who simply happen to work for the government office that files criminal charges against suspects. <a href="/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer" id="w">Criminal defense lawyers</a> specialize in the defense of those charged with any crimes.</p>
<a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h1>Education</h1>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The educational prerequisites to becoming a lawyer vary greatly from country to country. In some countries, law is taught by a <a href="/wiki/Faculty_of_law" id="w">faculty of law</a>, which is a department of a university&#39;s general undergraduate college.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup>  Law students in those countries pursue a <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Laws" id="w">Master</a> or <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Laws" id="w">Bachelor of Laws</a> degree.  In some countries it is common or even required for students to earn another bachelor&#39;s degree at the same time.  Nor is the LL.B the sole obstacle; it is often followed by a series of advanced examinations, apprenticeships, and additional coursework at special government institutes.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>In other countries, particularly the United States, law is primarily taught at <a href="/wiki/Law_school" id="w">law schools</a>.  In the United States<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> and countries following the American model, (such as <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a><sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> with the exception of the province of Quebec) law schools are graduate/professional schools where a bachelor&#39;s degree is a prerequisite for admission.  Most law schools are part of universities but a few are independent institutions.  Law schools in the United States (and some in Canada and elsewhere) award graduating students a J.D. (<a href="/wiki/Juris_Doctor" id="w">Juris Doctor</a>/Doctor of Jurisprudence) (as opposed to the <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Laws" id="w">Bachelor of Laws</a>) as the practitioner&#39;s law degree. However, like other professional doctorates (including the M.D.), the J.D. is not the exact equivalent of the Ph.D., since it does not require the submission of a full dissertation based on original research.  Many schools also offer post-doctoral law degrees such as the LL.M (Legum Magister/Master of Laws), or the S.J.D. (Scientiae Juridicae Doctor/Doctor of the Science of Law) for students interested in advancing their knowledge and credentials in a specific area of law.  </p>
<p>The methods and quality of legal education vary widely.  Some countries require extensive clinical training in the form of apprenticeships or special clinical courses.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup>  Others do not, like Venezuela.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup>   A few countries prefer to teach through assigned readings of judicial opinions (the <a href="/wiki/Casebook_method" id="w">casebook method</a>) followed by intense in-class cross-examination by the professor (the <a href="/wiki/Socratic_method" id="w">Socratic method</a>).<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup>  Many others have only lectures on highly abstract legal doctrines, which forces young lawyers to figure out how to actually think and write like a lawyer at their first apprenticeship (or job).<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup>  Depending upon the country, a typical class size could range from five students in a seminar to five hundred in a giant lecture room.  In the United States, law schools maintain small class sizes, and as such, grant admissions on a more limited and competitive basis.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Some students have a preference for full-time law programs,<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> while others often work full- or part-time to pay the tuition and fees of their part-time law programs.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup>  </p>

<a id="Common_law/civil_law" name="Common_law/civil_law"></a><h2>Common law/civil law</h2>
<p>In most common law countries, especially those with fused professions, lawyers have many options over the course of their careers.  Besides private practice, they can always aspire to becoming a <a href="/wiki/Prosecutor" id="w">prosecutor</a>, government counsel, corporate in-house counsel, <a href="/wiki/Administrative_law_judge" id="w">administrative law judge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Judge" id="w">judge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arbitrator" id="w">arbitrator</a>, <a href="/wiki/Law_professor" id="w">law professor</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Politician" id="w">politician</a>.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup>  There are also many non-legal jobs which legal training is good preparation for, such as <a href="/wiki/Corporate_executive" id="w">corporate executive</a>, government administrator, <a href="/wiki/Investment_banker" id="w">investment banker</a>, <a href="/wiki/Entrepreneur" id="w">entrepreneur</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Journalist" id="w">journalist</a>.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup>  In developing countries like India, a large majority of law students never actually practice, but simply use their law degree as a foundation for careers in other fields.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In most civil law countries, lawyers generally structure their legal education around their chosen specialty; the boundaries between different types of lawyers are carefully defined and hard to cross.  After one earns a law degree, career mobility may be severely constrained.  For example, unlike their American counterparts,<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> it is difficult for German judges to leave the bench and become advocates in private practice.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup> Another interesting example is France, where for much of the 20th century, all magistrates were graduates of an elite professional school for judges.  Although the French magistracy has begun experimenting with the Anglo-American model of appointing judges from accomplished advocates, the few advocates who have actually joined the bench this way are looked down upon by their colleagues who have taken the traditional route to magistracy.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In a few civil law countries, such as <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Sweden</a>,<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> the legal profession is <i>not</i> rigorously bifurcated and everyone within it can easily change roles and arenas.</p>
<a id="Specialization" name="Specialization"></a><h2>Specialization</h2>
<p>In many countries, lawyers are general practitioners who will take almost any kind of case that walks in the door.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup> In others, there has been a tendency since the start of the 20th century for lawyers to specialize early in their careers.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup>  In countries where specialization is prevalent, many lawyers specialize in representing one side in one particular area of the law; thus, it is common in the United States to hear of plaintiffs&#39; personal injury attorneys.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Organization" name="Organization"></a><h2>Organization</h2>

<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Lawyers in private practice generally work in specialized <a href="/wiki/Business" id="w">businesses</a> known as <a href="/wiki/Law_firm" id="w">law firms</a>,<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup> with the exception of English barristers.  The vast majority of law firms worldwide are <a href="/wiki/Small_business" id="w">small businesses</a> that range in size from 1 to 10 lawyers.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup>  The United States, with its large number of firms with more than 50 lawyers, is an exception.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup>  The United Kingdom and Australia are also exceptions, as the UK, Australia and the U.S. are now home to several firms with more than 1,000 lawyers after a wave of mergers in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>Notably, <a href="/wiki/Barrister" id="w">barristers</a> in <a href="/wiki/England_and_Wales" id="w">England and Wales</a> and some states in <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> do <i>not</i> work in &#34;law firms&#34;.  Those who offer their services to the general public &#8212; as opposed to those working &#34;in house&#34; &#8212; are required to be self-employed.<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup> Most work in groupings known as &#34;sets&#34; or &#34;chambers&#34;, where some administrative and marketing costs are shared. An important effect of this different organizational structure is that there is no conflict of interest where barristers in the same chambers work for opposing sides in a case, and in some specialised chambers this is commonplace.</p>

<a id="Mandatory_licensing_and_membership_in_professional_organizations" name="Mandatory_licensing_and_membership_in_professional_organizations"></a><h2>Mandatory licensing and membership in professional organizations</h2>
<p>In some jurisdictions, either the judiciary<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup> or the Ministry of Justice<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup> directly supervises the admission, licensing, and regulation of lawyers.  </p>
<p>Other jurisdictions, by statute, tradition, or court order, have granted such powers to a professional association which all lawyers must belong to.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup>  In the U.S., such associations are known as mandatory, integrated, or unified <a href="/wiki/Bar_association" id="w">bar associations</a>.  In the Commonwealth of Nations, similar organizations are known as <a href="/wiki/Inns_of_Court" id="w">Inns of Court</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bar_council" id="w">bar councils</a> or <a href="/wiki/Law_society" id="w">law societies</a>.<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup> In civil law countries, comparable organizations are known as Orders of Advocates,<sup id="_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#_note-96" title="">[96]</a></sup> Chambers of Advocates,<sup id="_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#_note-97" title="">[97]</a></sup> Colleges of Advocates,<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup> Faculties of Advocates,<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup> or similar names.  Generally, a nonmember caught practicing law may be liable for the crime of <a href="/wiki/Unauthorized_practice_of_law" id="w">unauthorized practice of law</a>.<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup></p>
<p>In common law countries with divided legal professions, barristers traditionally belong to the bar council (or an Inn of Court) and solicitors belong to the law society.  In the English-speaking world, the largest mandatory professional association of lawyers is the <a href="/wiki/State_Bar_of_California" id="w">State Bar of California</a>, with 200,000 members.</p>
<p>Some countries admit and regulate lawyers at the national level, so that a lawyer, once licensed, can argue cases in any court in the land.  This is common in small countries like <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a>, Japan, and Belgium.<sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[101]</a></sup>  Others, especially those with federal governments, tend to regulate lawyers at the state or provincial level; this is the case in the United States,<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup> Canada,<sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[103]</a></sup> Australia,<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[104]</a></sup> and Switzerland,<sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup> to name a few.  Brazil is the most well-known federal government that regulates lawyers at the national level.<sup id="_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#_note-106" title="">[106]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Some countries, like Italy, regulate lawyers at the regional level,<sup id="_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#_note-107" title="">[107]</a></sup> and a few, like Belgium, even regulate them at the local level (that is, they are licensed and regulated by the local equivalent of bar associations but can advocate in courts nationwide).<sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[108]</a></sup> In Germany, lawyers are admitted to regional bars, but may appear for clients before all courts nationwide, except for the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Justice_of_Germany" id="w">Federal Court of Justice of Germany</a> in civil cases.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Such geographic limitations can be troublesome for a lawyer who discovers that his client&#39;s cause requires him to litigate in a court beyond the normal geographic scope of his license.  Although most courts have special <i><a href="/wiki/Pro_hac_vice" id="w">pro hac vice</a></i> rules for such occasions, the lawyer will still have to deal with a different set of <a href="/wiki/Professional_responsibility" id="w">professional responsibility</a> rules, as well as the possibility of other differences in substantive and procedural law.  </p>
<p>Some countries grant licenses to non-resident lawyers, who may then appear regularly on behalf of foreign clients.  Others require all lawyers to live in the jurisdiction or to even hold national citizenship as a prerequisite for receiving a license to practice.  For example, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada" id="w">Supreme Court of Canada</a> struck down a citizenship requirement on equality rights grounds in 1989,<sup id="_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#_note-109" title="">[109]</a></sup> and similarly, American citizenship and residency requirements were struck down as unconstitutional by the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court" id="w">U.S. Supreme Court</a> in 1973 and 1985, respectively.<sup id="_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#_note-110" title="">[110]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Who_regulates_lawyers" name="Who_regulates_lawyers"></a><h2>Who regulates lawyers</h2>
<p>A key difference among countries is whether lawyers should be regulated solely by an independent judiciary and its subordinate institutions (a self-regulating legal profession), or whether lawyers should be subject to supervision by the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice" id="w">Ministry of Justice</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Executive_branch" id="w">executive branch</a>.  </p>
<p>In most civil law countries, the government has traditionally exercised tight control over the legal profession in order to ensure a steady supply of loyal judges and bureaucrats.  That is, lawyers were expected first and foremost to serve the state, and the availability of counsel for private litigants was an afterthought.<sup id="_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#_note-111" title="">[111]</a></sup> Even in civil law countries like Norway which have partially self-regulating professions, the Ministry of Justice is the sole issuer of licenses, and makes its own independent re-evaluation of a lawyer&#39;s fitness to practice after a lawyer has been expelled from the Advocates&#39; Association.<sup id="_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#_note-112" title="">[112]</a></sup> Brazil is an unusual exception in that its national Order of Advocates has become a fully self-regulating institution (with direct control over licensing) and has successfully resisted government attempts to place it under the control of the Ministry of Labor.<sup id="_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#_note-113" title="">[113]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#_note-114" title="">[114]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Of all the civil law countries, Communist countries historically went the farthest towards total state control, with all Communist lawyers forced to practice in collectives by the mid-1950s.<sup id="_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#_note-115" title="">[115]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#_note-116" title="">[116]</a></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, common law lawyers have traditionally regulated themselves through institutions where the influence of non-lawyers, if any, was weak and indirect (despite nominal state control).<sup id="_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#_note-117" title="">[117]</a></sup> Such institutions have been traditionally dominated by private practitioners who opposed strong state control of the profession on the grounds that it would endanger the ability of lawyers to zealously and competently advocate their clients&#39; causes in the <a href="/wiki/Adversarial_system" id="w">adversarial system</a> of justice.<sup id="_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#_note-118" title="">[118]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, the concept of the self-regulating profession has been criticized as a sham which serves to legitimize the professional monopoly while protecting the profession from public scrutiny.<sup id="_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#_note-119" title="">[119]</a></sup> Disciplinary mechanisms have been astonishingly ineffective, and penalties have been light or nonexistent.<sup id="_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#_note-120" title="">[120]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#_note-121" title="">[121]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#_note-122" title="">[122]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Voluntary_associations_of_lawyers" name="Voluntary_associations_of_lawyers"></a><h2>Voluntary associations of lawyers</h2>
<p>Lawyers are always free to form voluntary associations of their own, apart from any licensing or mandatory membership that may be required by the laws of their jurisdiction.  Like their mandatory counterparts, such organizations may exist at all geographic levels.<sup id="_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#_note-123" title="">[123]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#_note-124" title="">[124]</a></sup>    In American English, such associations are known as voluntary bar associations.<sup id="_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#_note-125" title="">[125]</a></sup>  The largest voluntary professional association of lawyers in the English-speaking world is the <a href="/wiki/American_Bar_Association" id="w">American Bar Association</a>.</p>

<a id="Ancient_Greece" name="Ancient_Greece"></a><h2>Ancient Greece</h2>
<p>The earliest people who could be described as &#34;lawyers&#34; were probably the <a href="/wiki/Orators" id="w">orators</a> of ancient <a href="/wiki/Athens" id="w">Athens</a> (see <a href="/wiki/History_of_Athens" id="w">History of Athens</a>). However, Athenian orators faced serious structural obstacles.  First, there was a rule that individuals were supposed to plead their own cases, which was soon bypassed by the increasing tendency of individuals to ask a &#34;friend&#34; for assistance.<sup id="_ref-154" class="reference"><a href="#_note-154" title="">[154]</a></sup>  Fortunately, around the middle of the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_century_BC" id="w">fourth century BC</a>, the Athenians disposed of the perfunctory request for a friend.<sup id="_ref-155" class="reference"><a href="#_note-155" title="">[155]</a></sup>  Second, a more serious obstacle, which the Athenian orators never completely overcame, was the rule that no one could take a fee to plead the cause of another.  This law was widely disregarded in practice, but was never abolished, which meant that orators could <i>never</i> present themselves as legal professionals or experts.<sup id="_ref-156" class="reference"><a href="#_note-156" title="">[156]</a></sup>  They had to uphold the <a href="/wiki/Legal_fiction" id="w">legal fiction</a> that they were merely an ordinary citizen generously helping out a friend for free, and thus they could never organize into a real profession &#8212; with professional associations and titles and all the other pomp and circumstance &#8212; like their modern counterparts.<sup id="_ref-157" class="reference"><a href="#_note-157" title="">[157]</a></sup>  Therefore, if one narrows the definition to those men who could practice the legal profession openly and legally, then the first lawyers would have to be the orators of <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">ancient Rome</a>.</p>
<a id="Early_Ancient_Rome" name="Early_Ancient_Rome"></a><h2>Early Ancient Rome</h2>
<p>A law enacted in 204 BC barred Roman advocates from taking fees, but the law was widely ignored.<sup id="_ref-158" class="reference"><a href="#_note-158" title="">[158]</a></sup>  The ban on fees was abolished by <a href="/wiki/Claudius" id="w">Emperor Claudius</a>, who legalized advocacy as a profession and allowed the Roman advocates to become the first lawyers who could practice openly &#8212; but he also imposed a fee ceiling of 10,000 <a href="/wiki/Sestertius" id="w">sesterces</a>.<sup id="_ref-159" class="reference"><a href="#_note-159" title="">[159]</a></sup>  This was apparently not much money; the <a href="/wiki/Satires_of_Juvenal" id="w">Satires of Juvenal</a> complain that there was no money in working as an advocate.<sup id="_ref-160" class="reference"><a href="#_note-160" title="">[160]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Like their Greek contemporaries, early Roman advocates were trained in <a href="/wiki/Rhetoric" id="w">rhetoric</a>, not law, and the judges before whom they argued were also not law-trained.<sup id="_ref-161" class="reference"><a href="#_note-161" title="">[161]</a></sup>  But very early on, unlike Athens, Rome developed a class of specialists who were learned in the law, known as jurisconsults (<i>iuris consulti</i>).<sup id="_ref-162" class="reference"><a href="#_note-162" title="">[162]</a></sup>  Jurisconsults were wealthy amateurs who dabbled in law as an intellectual hobby; they did not make their primary living from it.<sup id="_ref-163" class="reference"><a href="#_note-163" title="">[163]</a></sup>  They gave legal opinions (<i>responsa</i>) on legal issues to all comers (a practice known as <i>publice respondere</i>).<sup id="_ref-164" class="reference"><a href="#_note-164" title="">[164]</a></sup>  Roman judges and governors would routinely consult with an advisory panel of jurisconsults before rendering a decision, and advocates and ordinary people also went to jurisconsults for legal opinions.<sup id="_ref-165" class="reference"><a href="#_note-165" title="">[165]</a></sup>  Thus, the Romans were the first to have a class of people who spent their days thinking about legal problems, and this is why their law became so &#34;precise, detailed, and technical.&#34;<sup id="_ref-166" class="reference"><a href="#_note-166" title="">[166]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Late_Ancient_Rome" name="Late_Ancient_Rome"></a><h2>Late Ancient Rome</h2>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republic" id="w">Roman Republic</a> and the early <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Roman Empire</a>, jurisconsults and advocates were unregulated, since the former were amateurs and the latter were technically illegal.<sup id="_ref-167" class="reference"><a href="#_note-167" title="">[167]</a></sup>  Any citizen could call himself an advocate or a legal expert, though whether people believed him would depend upon his personal reputation.  This changed once Claudius legalized the legal profession.  By the start of the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" id="w">Byzantine Empire</a>, the legal profession had become well-established, heavily regulated, and highly stratified.<sup id="_ref-168" class="reference"><a href="#_note-168" title="">[168]</a></sup>  The centralization and bureaucratization of the profession was apparently gradual at first, but accelerated during the reign of Emperor <a href="/wiki/Hadrian" id="w">Hadrian</a>.<sup id="_ref-169" class="reference"><a href="#_note-169" title="">[169]</a></sup>  At the same time, the jurisconsults went into decline during the imperial period.<sup id="_ref-170" class="reference"><a href="#_note-170" title="">[170]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>In the words of Fritz Schulz, &#34;by the fourth century things had changed in the eastern Empire: advocates now were really lawyers.&#34;<sup id="_ref-171" class="reference"><a href="#_note-171" title="">[171]</a></sup> For example, by the fourth century, advocates had be enrolled on the bar of a court to argue before it, they could only be attached to one court at a time, and there were restrictions (which came and went depending upon who was emperor) on how many advocates could be enrolled at a particular court.<sup id="_ref-172" class="reference"><a href="#_note-172" title="">[172]</a></sup>  By the 380s, advocates were studying law in addition to rhetoric (thus reducing the need for a separate class of jurisconsults); in 460, <a href="/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian" id="w">Emperor Leo</a> imposed a requirement that new advocates seeking admission had to produce testimonials from their teachers; and by the sixth century, a regular course of legal study lasting about four years was required for admission.<sup id="_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#_note-173" title="">[173]</a></sup>  Claudius&#39;s fee ceiling lasted all the way into the Byzantine period, though by then it was measured at 100 <a href="/wiki/Solidus_(coin)" id="w">solidi</a>.<sup id="_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#_note-174" title="">[174]</a></sup>  Of course, it was widely evaded, either through demands for maintenance and expenses or a <i>sub rosa</i> <a href="/wiki/Barter_(economics)" id="w">barter</a> transaction.<sup id="_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#_note-175" title="">[175]</a></sup>  The latter was cause for disbarment.<sup id="_ref-176" class="reference"><a href="#_note-176" title="">[176]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The notaries (<i>tabelliones</i>) appeared in the late Roman Empire.  Like their modern-day descendants, the civil law notaries, they were responsible for drafting wills, conveyances, and contracts.<sup id="_ref-177" class="reference"><a href="#_note-177" title="">[177]</a></sup>  They were ubiquitous and most villages had one.<sup id="_ref-178" class="reference"><a href="#_note-178" title="">[178]</a></sup>  In Roman times, notaries were widely considered to be inferior to advocates and jurisconsults.<sup id="_ref-179" class="reference"><a href="#_note-179" title="">[179]</a></sup>  Roman notaries were not law-trained; they were barely literate hacks who wrapped the simplest transactions in mountains of legal jargon, since they were paid by the line.<sup id="_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#_note-180" title="">[180]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Middle_Ages" name="Middle_Ages"></a><h2>Middle Ages</h2>
<p>After the fall of the western Empire and the onset of the Dark Ages, the legal profession of Western Europe collapsed.  As James Brundage has explained: &#34;[by 1140], no one in Western Europe could properly be described as a professional lawyer or a professional canonist in anything like the modern sense of the term &#39;professional.&#39; &#34;<sup id="_ref-181" class="reference"><a href="#_note-181" title="">[181]</a></sup>  However, from 1150 onward, a small but increasing number of men became experts in <a href="/wiki/Canon_law" id="w">canon law</a> but only in furtherance of other occupational goals, such as serving the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic Church</a> as priests.<sup id="_ref-182" class="reference"><a href="#_note-182" title="">[182]</a></sup>  From 1190 to 1230, however, there was a crucial shift in which some men began to practice canon law as a lifelong profession in itself.<sup id="_ref-183" class="reference"><a href="#_note-183" title="">[183]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The legal profession&#39;s return was marked by the renewed efforts of church and state to regulate it.  In 1231 two French councils mandated that lawyers had to swear an oath of admission before practicing before the bishop&#39;s courts in their regions, and a similar oath was promulgated by the papal legate in London in 1237.<sup id="_ref-184" class="reference"><a href="#_note-184" title="">[184]</a></sup>  During the same decade, Frederick II, the emperor of the Kingdom of Sicily, imposed a similar oath in his civil courts.<sup id="_ref-185" class="reference"><a href="#_note-185" title="">[185]</a></sup>  By 1250 the a nucleus of a new legal profession had clearly formed.<sup id="_ref-186" class="reference"><a href="#_note-186" title="">[186]</a></sup>  The new trend towards professionalization culminated in a controversial proposal at the <a href="/wiki/Second_Council_of_Lyon" id="w">Second Council of Lyon</a> in 1275 that <i>all</i> ecclesiastical courts should require an oath of admission.<sup id="_ref-187" class="reference"><a href="#_note-187" title="">[187]</a></sup>  Although not adopted by the council, it was highly influential in many such courts throughout Europe.<sup id="_ref-188" class="reference"><a href="#_note-188" title="">[188]</a></sup>  The civil courts in England also joined the trend towards professionalization; in 1275 a statute was enacted that prescribed punishment for professional lawyers guilty of deceit, and in 1280 the mayor&#39;s court of the city of London promulgated regulations concerning admission procedures, including the administering of an oath.<sup id="_ref-189" class="reference"><a href="#_note-189" title="">[189]</a></sup></p>
