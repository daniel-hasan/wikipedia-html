<a id="Michael_Soussoudis" name="Michael_Soussoudis"></a><h1>Michael Soussoudis</h1>
<p>Michael Agbotui Soussoudis  was born in April 1946<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> in <a href="/wiki/Accra%2C_Ghana" id="w">Accra, Ghana</a>. He was brought up in <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" id="w">West Germany</a>, and went to college in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>, where he also was married and divorced to an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> woman. He returned to <a href="/wiki/Ghana" id="w">Ghana</a> after college, and was described as leading a &#34;playboy lifestyle, due to his party lifestyle and friendship with American women, he was described as &#34;more American than <a href="/wiki/African" id="w">African</a>.&#34; As an adult he was described as a handsome, debonair character.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Soussoudis formed a romantic relationship with <a href="/wiki/CIA" id="w">CIA</a> employee Sharon Scranage sometime between May 27, 1983 and October 1984,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> eventually getting her to confide confidential information to him. The affair reportedly lasted 18 months and it is unclear if the CIA had directed Scranage to form a relatioship with Soussoudis, or if the relationship happened spontaneously.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The first indications of tha affair occurred in 1983 when an Office of Security officer was at Scranage&#39;s home for dinner and noticed a picture of a man, later identified as Soussoudis on the vanity of her mirror. The picture showed a shirtless Soussoudis with blankets pulled up to his chest.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Upon Scranage&#39;s return to the U.S. she failed a routine polygraph test, and further questioning led to the <a href="/wiki/CIA" id="w">CIA</a> uncovering how much information Soussoudis had obtained from her. American authorities claimed that Scranage had handed Soussoudis &#34;sensitive documents and the names of virtually everyone working for the C.I.A. in the country.&#34;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Soussoudis is an example of employing a successful <a href="/wiki/Honey_trap" id="w">honey trap</a>{{Disambiguation needed}} to gain classified information.</p>
<p>Scranage, who worked in Ghana in the role of Operations Support Assistant, passed classified information to her boyfriend, Michael Soussoudis. Soussoudis, a Ghanaian citizen with permanent residence in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, was a Ghanaian intelligence officer who had been assigned to seduce Scranage and solicit US intelligence from her. Soussoudis obtained from Scranage the identities of eight Ghanaian citizens who were spying for the CIA, as well as plans for a coup against the Ghanaian government by dissidents. Soussoudis then passed the information to intelligence chief <a href="/wiki/Kojo_Tsikata" id="w">Kojo Tsikata</a>. The Ghanaians exposed as CIA spies by the intelligence were subsequently arrested. Tsikata is alleged to have shared the information with several countries in the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_bloc" id="w">Soviet bloc</a>.</p>

<p>Scranage is said to have come under suspicion when, upon her return to the United States in 1985, she failed a routine <a href="/wiki/Polygraph" id="w">polygraph</a> test. After an investigation, Scranage cooperated with the authorities, and assisted in the arrest of Soussoudis. Soussoudis was later released in exchange for the Ghanaians arrested as CIA spies, who were deported to the United States and stripped of their Ghanaian citizenship.</p>
<p>Scranage was charged with espionage and with breaking the <a href="/wiki/Intelligence_Identities_Protection_Act" id="w">Intelligence Identities Protection Act</a>. She pleaded guilty to three of the eighteen charges against her, with the others being dropped. She was sentenced to five years in prison, later reduced to two years.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>After Scranage&#39;s relationship with Soussoudis was discovered, Scranage agreed to help the <a href="/wiki/FBI" id="w">FBI</a> lure him to <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">America</a>. While on leave back in the U.S. while Soussoudis was also there, Scranage contacted him and asked to meet at a motel in northern Virginia, where Soussoudis was arrested and charged with 8 counts of espionage.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> During a closed court hearing, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison by the United States, but was eventually traded in exchange for eight of the agents whose identities he had helped compromise in Ghana. A condition of his release was that his sentence would be commuted if he left the United States in under 24 hours, and he was not allowed to return.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> On December third, 1985 he returned to Ghana and was greeted by thousands of cheering citizens.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Fallout_and_Consequences" name="Fallout_and_Consequences"></a><h1>Fallout and Consequences</h1>
<p>The information Soussoudis obtained from Sharon Scranage led to the arrest of 8 <a href="/wiki/Ghanaian" id="w">Ghanaian</a> citizens spying for the <a href="/wiki/CIA" id="w">CIA</a> in <a href="/wiki/Ghana" id="w">Ghana</a>, as well as the uncovering of a planned coup by Godfrey Osei, of which there are allegations that a western power supported.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> This coup was allegedly already in motion with a boat carrying six tons of heavy weapons when the crew rebelled. This led to the boat of arms and mercenaries returning to <a href="/wiki/Brazil" id="w">Brazil</a> and the mercenaries being arrested, and later breaking out of prison and making their way back to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Among the 8 arrested in <a href="/wiki/Ghana" id="w">Ghana</a> included Naval Capt Oppong, Colonol Bray, Abel Edusei, Adu Gyamfi, Major John Kwaky Awuakye, and of these men most of them had been issued sentences ranging from 25 years of hard labor, to life in prison. These men constituted some of the most high ranking informants the <a href="/wiki/CIA" id="w">CIA</a> had in the  government of <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Rawlings" id="w">Jerry Rawlings</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> These 8 CIA spies were stripped of their Ghanain citizenship before being deported to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, and being relocated in the Virginia/ D.C. area.</p>
