The <b>Thunder Bay Twins</b> were a <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canadian</a> <a href="/wiki/Senior_hockey" id="w">Amateur Senior</a> and Professional <a href="/wiki/Ice_hockey" id="w">ice hockey</a> team from <a href="/wiki/Thunder_Bay%2C_Ontario" id="w">Thunder Bay</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ontario" id="w">Ontario</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>. The Twins won five <a href="/wiki/Allan_Cup" id="w">Allan Cups</a> as National Senior Champions from 1970 until 1991.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<a id="Merger" name="Merger"></a><h2>Merger</h2>
<p>The Port Arthur Bearcats and the Fort William Beavers were a pair of Senior &#34;A&#34; teams in <a href="/wiki/Northwestern_Ontario" id="w">Northwestern Ontario</a>&#39;s Thunder Bay Senior A Hockey League.  Very often, these two teams were the only actual teams in the league.</p>
<p>The Beavers dated back to at least the 1950&#39;s.  In 1955, the Beavers travelled to <a href="/wiki/Kitchener%2C_Ontario" id="w">Kitchener, Ontario</a> to challenge the <a href="/wiki/Kitchener-Waterloo_Dutchmen_Sr._A" id="w">Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Allan_Cup" id="w">Allan Cup</a>.  The Dutchmen won game one 3-2 and the Beavers evened the series in game two with a 6-4 win.  From that point on the series was controlled by the Dutchmen as they took the next three straight with 6-2, 7-6, and 5-3 victories.</p>
<p>The Bearcats were the namesake of a team that once challenged for the <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Cup" id="w">Stanley Cup</a> and were founded in 1946.  Prior to this, the Port Arthur Shipbuilders challenged for the 1944 Allan Cup.  In <a href="/wiki/Quebec_City%2C_Quebec" id="w">Quebec City, Quebec</a>, the Shipbuilders challenged the <a href="/wiki/Quebec_City_Aces" id="w">Quebec City Aces</a> but were defeated three-games-straight by scores of 6-1, 15-4, and 9-6.</p>
<p>In 1970, the towns of <a href="/wiki/Fort_William%2C_Ontario" id="w">Fort William</a> and <a href="/wiki/Port_Arthur%2C_Ontario" id="w">Port Arthur</a> merged and became <a href="/wiki/Thunder_Bay%2C_Ontario" id="w">Thunder Bay, Ontario</a>.  The decision was made to merge the two senior teams as well, resulting in the folding of the Thunder Bay Senior A Hockey League and the creation of the Thunder Bay Twins.</p>
<a id="USHL_and_the_OHA" name="USHL_and_the_OHA"></a><h2>USHL and the OHA</h2>
<p>The newly created Thunder Bay Twins started in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/United_States_Hockey_League" id="w">United States Hockey League</a> in 1970.  Now a Tier I Junior &#34;A&#34; league, the USHL was a Semi-Professional league in the 1970s.</p>
<p>After their final season with the USHL in 1975, the Twins challenged and won the Western Canadian Senior &#34;A&#34; Championship and earned a chance to play for the <a href="/wiki/Allan_Cup" id="w">Allan Cup</a>.  The Allan Cup is awarded to the National Senior Championship.  The Eastern champion and their opponent was the <a href="/wiki/Barrie_Flyers_(1966-1979)" id="w">Barrie Flyers</a> of the <a href="/wiki/OHA_Senior_A_Hockey_League_(1929-1979)" id="w">OHA Senior A Hockey League</a>.  The Flyers got a foot up on the Twins in game one in Barrie, winning 8-5.  In game two, the Twins evened the series 7-2, just to fall back a game in game three with a 7-4 loss -- both in Barrie.  The series then moved up to Thunder Bay and the Twins caught fire, winning the next three games at home 8-2, 5-2, and 8-4 respectively to win their first national championship.</p>
<p>In 1975, the Thunder Bay Twins decided to join the <a href="/wiki/OHA_Senior_A_Hockey_League_(1929-1979)" id="w">OHA Senior A Hockey League</a>.  The played in the OSAHL until 1979.  In that time, the Twins won two regular season championships and one league playoff title.</p>
<a id="Manitoba_Sr._A" name="Manitoba_Sr._A"></a><h2>Manitoba Sr. A</h2>
<p>From 1979 until 1986, the Twins played in the Manitoba Senior A Hockey League.  In 1981, the Twins hosted a round robin tournament to determine an Allan Cup champion.  The Twins started off the tournament against the <a href="/wiki/Petrolia_Squires" id="w">Petrolia Squires</a>, defeating them 8-3.  In game two, they faced the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Falls_Cataracts" id="w">Grand Falls Cataracts</a> and defeated them 9-4.  In the third and final game of the round robin, the Twins met the <a href="/wiki/St._Boniface_Mohawks" id="w">St. Boniface Mohawks</a> and beat them 5-4 in overtime to clinch first place in the round robin.  In the tournament semi-final, something went wrong for the twins.  In their second straight game against the Mohawks, the Twins were shocked 4-3 and eliminated from the tournament despite a 3-1 record.  The Petrolia Squires won the 1981 Allan Cup.</p>
<p>In 1984, the Twins were again Manitoba and Western Canadian champions.  They played host to the <a href="/wiki/Cambridge_Hornets" id="w">Cambridge Hornets</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Fort_Williams_Gardens" id="w">Fort Williams Gardens</a> in a best-of-seven series.  The Twins opened the series squeezing out a 3-2 victory over the Hornets.  Cambridge came back in game two and rocked the Twins 7-3.  After this, the Twins battened down the hatches and fought through a pair of tight wins (5-3, 6-5) to clinch the series in game five with a convincing 6-1 win to clinch the team&#39;s second Allan Cup.</p>
<p>In 1985, the Twins repeated as Manitoba and Western champions and found themselves in a best-of-seven marathon with the <a href="/wiki/Corner_Brook_Royals" id="w">Corner Brook Royals</a> in <a href="/wiki/Corner_Brook%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" id="w">Corner Brook, Newfoundland</a>.  So far from home, the Twins may have accomplished one of the greatest feats in amateur hockey history.  The Corner Brook Royals crushed the jet lagged Twins 9-5 in game one.  Game two went a little better for the Twins, as they forced overtime but were overpowered by the Royals 3-2.  Game three needed to be won by the Twins, but again they were embarrassed by the Eastern champions 9-5.  With their back against the wall down 3-games-to-none, the Twins began their trek back.  Game four ended with a 4-2 nail biter of a win for the Twins.  Game five saw the Twins embarrass a seemingly deflated Royals squad 8-3.  The twin took game six 2-0 and then finished the comeback with an unbearably close 5-4 victory.  With their third Allan Cup victory, the Twins became the only team in Allan Cup history to comeback from a 3-0 deficit to win the Allan Cup.  As the tournament is now in a round robin format and a revert to best-of-sevens are very unlikely, the feat may never be repeated.</p>
<a id="OHA_and_back_to_Manitoba" name="OHA_and_back_to_Manitoba"></a><h2>OHA and back to Manitoba</h2>
<p>In 1986, the Twins moved to the four-team <a href="/wiki/OHA_Senior_A_Hockey_League" id="w">OHA Senior A Hockey League</a>.  After one lackluster season for the Twins, the league folded and the Twins returned to the Manitoba Senior A Hockey League.</p>
<p>The 1987-88 season had the Twins win the Manitoba and Western titles and find themselves in the Allan Cup final again.  Playing at home in the Gardens, the Twins found themselves against a starkly lesser opponent.  The Eastern champions in 1988 were the <a href="/wiki/Charlottetown_Islanders_Sr._A" id="w">Charlottetown Islanders</a>.  The Twins easily swept the Islanders by scores of 7-4, 10-2, 9-3, and 7-1 respectively to win their fourth ever Allan Cup.</p>
<p>The 1989 Allan Cup brought a significant challenge to the Twins.  League champions again, the Twins found themselves in a Allan Cup round robin with three other teams.  In game one of the round robin, the Twins met an old rival in the St. Boniface Mohawks and lost 5-3.  In game two, the Twins met the <a href="/wiki/Montreal_Team_Chomedey" id="w">Montreal Team Chomedey</a> and defeated them 6-3.  In the final game of the round robin, the Twins met the <a href="/wiki/Bassano_Hawks" id="w">Bassano Hawks</a> and defeated soundly 7-1 to clinch second place.  Thunder Bay found themselves in a sudden death semi-final against Montreal for the right to play in the final.  The Twins beat Chomedey 6-3.  The final was set up as a best-of-three games set and was against St. Boniface.  The Twins avenged the 1981 Allan Cup semi-final loss to the Mohawks by defeating them 2-0 and then 4-2 to win their fifth Allan Cup championship.</p>
<p>After winning the 1990-91 Manitoba title and the Western Canadian championship, the Twins found themselves yet again in the Allan Cup final.  The Eastern champion was the Charlottetown Islanders, a team that the Twins had embarrassed in 1988 in a lopsided four-game-sweep.  This time the Islanders came out to return the favour in their own home rink in <a href="/wiki/Charlottetown%2C_Prince_Edward_Island" id="w">Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island</a>.  The Islanders won four straight games (5-3, 5-2, 5-4, and 5-4 in overtime) to kill the Twins dream of a sixth Allan Cup.</p>
<a id="The_end" name="The_end"></a><h2>The end</h2>
<p>That summer, the <a href="/wiki/Colonial_Hockey_League" id="w">Colonial Hockey League</a> announced plans to expand to the city of <a href="/wiki/Thunder_Bay%2C_Ontario" id="w">Thunder Bay, Ontario</a>.  The Twins made way for the Semi-Professional <a href="/wiki/Thunder_Bay_Thunder_Hawks" id="w">Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks</a> who began play in the 1991-92 season.  Senior glory would not return to the city of Thunder Bay until the creation of the <a href="/wiki/Thunder_Bay_Bombers" id="w">Thunder Bay Bombers</a> many years later.</p>
<p>The 1974-75 Thunder Bay Twins were inducted into the Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1987.</p>
