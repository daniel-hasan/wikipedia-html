<p>The game led to the creation of a short-lived television cartoon series, <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon%26%2339%3Bs_Lair_(TV_series)" id="w">Dragon&#39;s Lair</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Ruby-Spears_Productions" id="w">Ruby-Spears Productions</a> where Dirk the Daring was voiced by Bob Sarlatte and the unseen storyteller that narrates each episode is voiced by <a href="/wiki/Clive_Revill" id="w">Clive Revill</a>. Changes in the TV series included the originally nameless Dragon was given the name Singe (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Burghardt" id="w">Arthur Burghardt</a>), Princess Daphne (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Ellen_Gerstell" id="w">Ellen Gerstell</a>) now wore a long pink dress, and included some exclusive characters like Princess Daphne&#39;s father King Ethelred (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Fred_Travalena" id="w">Fred Travalena</a>), Dirk the Daring&#39;s horse Bertram (vocal effects provided by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Cullen" id="w">Peter Cullen</a>), Dirk the Daring&#39;s squire Timothy (voiced by Michael Mish), and Dirk the Daring&#39;s rival Sir Hubert Blunt (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Cullen" id="w">Peter Cullen</a>). Several enemies from the original game also make their appearance as adversaries, such as the Lizard King, the Phantom Knight, the Giddy Goons, and the Mudmen. Thirteen half-hour episodes were produced and aired on the <a href="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" id="w">ABC</a> network from September 8, 1984, to April 27, 1985. It was last aired on the <a href="/wiki/USA_Cartoon_Express" id="w">USA Cartoon Express</a> between the late &#39;80s and the early &#39;90s. The show was generally run of the mill, but boasted an unusual feature: to keep the show in the spirit of the game, before each commercial break the storyteller would ask what the viewer would do to solve the problem facing Dirk. After the commercial break, the outcomes of the various choices were shown before Dirk acts on the correct idea (with the occasional exception) to save the day.</p>
<p>A comic book miniseries based on the game, but incorporating elements from the cartoon series as well, like Dirk&#39;s horse Bertram, was released in 2003 by Crossgen Publishing, concurrent with a mini series based on <i>Space Ace</i>. <a href="/wiki/Arcana_Studio" id="w">Arcana Studio</a> published the entire comic book series in 2006, as there were three issues that were never before published.</p>
