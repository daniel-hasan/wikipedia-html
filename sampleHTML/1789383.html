Marge and Homer go to Parent Night at <a href="/wiki/Springfield_Elementary_School" id="w">Springfield Elementary School</a> and <a href="/wiki/Edna_Krabappel" id="w">Ms. Krabappel</a> tells them that Bart needs more discipline, saying that Bart could become <a href="/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States" id="w">Chief Justice</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" id="w">Supreme Court</a>. Marge and Homer return home, where Bart had been wreaking havoc and had broken <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Simpson" id="w">Grampa</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/False_teeth" id="w">false teeth</a>. Bart is sent up to his room without dinner, but eventually Homer breaks and brings him some food (just as Bart was beginning to think that they might not give him any food after all, and that he would have to worry about consequences for his actions). Bart continues to get in trouble, and Homer does not enforce any of the punishments he gives out. Marge scolds Homer and he agrees that the next time he punishes Bart, he&#39;ll make it stick. Meanwhile, it is announced that there will be an <i>Itchy &#38; Scratchy Movie</i> and in anticipation, Bart buys himself a ticket. Later on, Bart is left to babysit for Maggie and he neglects to watch her. Maggie escapes and takes Homer&#39;s car for a drive, finally crashing through the wall of Springfield&#39;s prison, which allows many of the prisoners to escape. Homer angrily blames Bart and punishes him by forbidding him to ever go see <i>The Itchy &#38; Scratchy Movie</i>. Homer takes Bart&#39;s ticket to the movie and tears it up. Bart begs to be given a different punishment but Homer refuses.</p>
<p>After the movie&#39;s release, Bart becomes jealous of everyone who has been able to see it. After a while, Marge and Lisa beg Homer to change his mind, saying that Bart has been very well behaved. However, Homer refuses to change his mind, saying that if he sticks with the punishment, Bart could become a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Eventually, the Movie closes and Bart tells Homer that he won, to which Homer replies by saying that they both won.</p>
<p>In a flashforward to forty years into the future, Bart, now Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and Homer are walking down the street and discover that the movie is back in theaters. Homer decides that Bart has learned his lesson and the two watch the movie together.<sup id="_ref-bbc_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-officialsite_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialsite" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-book_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-book" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h2>Reception</h2>
<p>During the fourth season, <i>The Simpsons</i> usually aired on a Thursday, but &#34;Itchy &#38; Scratchy: The Movie&#34; aired on a Tuesday because the executives at Fox had wanted to air an episode during the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1992" id="w">1992 presidential election</a> results because they felt it would mean increased ratings.<sup id="_ref-Jean_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jean" title="">[5]</a></sup> Instead, the episode had approximately 80% of its normal audience.<sup id="_ref-Reiss_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reiss" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book <i>I Can&#39;t Believe It&#39;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide</i> called it a &#34;superb episode&#34;, especially &#34;[Homer]&#39;s suggestion for punishing Bart&#39;s misbehaviour is to give him a present, and his trick for avoiding jury duty is &#39;to say you&#39;re prejudiced against all races&#39;.&#34;<sup id="_ref-bbc_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc" title="">[2]</a></sup> &#34;Steamboat Itchy&#34; is one of Matt Groening&#39;s favorite moments in the history of the show.<sup id="_ref-Groening_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Groening" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
