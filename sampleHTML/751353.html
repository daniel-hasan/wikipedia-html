<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> History </h2>
<p>Chew Magna is the largest village in the district, and can trace its importance back to <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxons" id="w">Saxon</a> times. It was a thriving woollen centre in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a>. The manor of Chew was held by the <a href="/wiki/Bishops_of_Bath_and_Wells" id="w">Bishops of Bath and Wells</a>, from 1062 to 1548, and for that reason the village was called Chew Episcopi or Bishop&#39;s Chew. The Bishops built a palace near the church of St. Andrews, which was visited by <a href="/wiki/Henry_III_of_England" id="w">Henry III</a> in 1250.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>
Chew Court is a surviving part of the palace. More recently, since about 1600, the name has been Chew Magna because this has been the most important of the several villages along the banks of the <a href="/wiki/River_Chew" id="w">River Chew</a>. According to Robinson it was an episcopal property held by <a href="/wiki/Gisa%2C_Bishop_of_Wells" id="w">Giso</a>, the last Saxon bishop and the name Magna comes from the Latin meaning &#39;the greater&#39;.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Around 1700 the Lord of the Manor was Sir William Jones the <a href="/wiki/Attorney_General" id="w">Attorney General</a> of England<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> and in the 1820s it was the seat of <a href="/wiki/George_Lyttelton%2C_4th_Baron_Lyttelton" id="w">Lord Lyttelton</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>
