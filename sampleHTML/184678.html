<p>The <b>Papal <a href="/wiki/Tiara" id="w">Tiara</a></b>, also known as the <b>Triple Tiara</b>, or in <a href="/wiki/Latin_language" id="w">Latin</a> as the <b>&#39;Triregnum</b>&#39;, and in <a href="/wiki/Italian_language" id="w">Italian</a> as the <b>&#39;Triregno</b>&#39;, is the three-tiered <a href="/wiki/Gemstone" id="w">jewelled</a> papal crown, supposedly of <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" id="w">Byzantine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Persian_Empire" id="w">Persian</a> origin, that is a prominent symbol of the <a href="/wiki/Pope" id="w">papacy</a>.

<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>Papal tiaras were worn by the <a href="/wiki/Pope" id="w">popes</a> of <a href="/wiki/Rome" id="w">Rome</a> and <a href="/wiki/Avignon" id="w">Avignon</a> from <a href="/wiki/Pope_Clement_V" id="w">Pope Clement V</a> (d. 1314) to <a href="/wiki/Pope_Paul_VI" id="w">Pope Paul VI</a>, who was <a href="/wiki/Papal_Coronation" id="w">crowned</a> in 1963. Pope Paul VI abandoned the use of his own tiara after the <a href="/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council" id="w">Second Vatican Council</a>, symbolically laying it on the <a href="/wiki/Altar" id="w">altar</a> of <a href="/wiki/St._Peter%26%2339%3Bs_Basilica" id="w">St. Peter&#39;s Basilica</a>, and donating its value to the poor. However, his <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a> <a href="/wiki/Apostolic_Constitution" id="w">Apostolic Constitution</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Romano_Pontifici_Eligendo" id="w">Romano Pontifici Eligendo</a></i> on the manner of electing the Pope, still envisaged that his successors would be crowned.</p>
<p>However his immediate successor, <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_I" id="w">Pope John Paul I</a>, decided against a coronation, replacing it with a ceremony of what was called <a href="/wiki/Papal_Inauguration" id="w">&#34;Inauguration of the Supreme Pontificate&#34;</a>; and after John Paul I&#39;s sudden death, <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II" id="w">Pope John Paul II</a> told the congregation at his Inauguration:<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>Though not currently worn as part of papal regalia, the continuing symbolism of the papal tiara is reflected in its use on the flag and <a href="/wiki/Heraldry" id="w">coats of arms</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See" id="w">Holy See</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Vatican_City" id="w">Vatican</a>. Until the reign of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI" id="w">Benedict XVI</a> the tiara was also the ornament surmounting a Pope&#39;s personal coat of arms, as a tasselled hat (under which a 1969 Instruction of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See" id="w">Holy See</a> forbade the placing of a mitre, a second hat)<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  surmounted those of other prelates. In a break with tradition, <a href="/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Pope_Benedict_XVI" id="w">Pope Benedict XVI&#39;s personal coat of arms</a> has replaced the tiara with a <a href="/wiki/Mitre" id="w">mitre</a>. This particular mitre contains three levels reminiscent of the three tiers on the papal tiara.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> However, in the coat of arms of the Holy See and of the Vatican City State Pope Benedict XVI decided to keep the tiara, not a mitre.</p>

According to James-Charles Noonan<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Bruno_Heim" id="w">Bruno Heim</a><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> the lowest of the three crowns appeared at the base of the traditional white papal headgear in the ninth century. When the popes assumed temporal power in the <a href="/wiki/Papal_States" id="w">Papal States</a>, the base crown became decorated with jewels to resemble the crowns of princes. He suggested that a second crown was added by <a href="/wiki/Pope_Boniface_VIII" id="w">Pope Boniface VIII</a> in 1298 to symbolize spiritual dominion. Very soon after, in or around 1314, a third crown and lappets (cloth strips) were added; <a href="/wiki/Pope_Clement_V" id="w">Pope Clement V</a> was the first to wear the triple tiara.</p>
<p>However, a <span class="image"><img alt="fresco" rel="nofollow" src="http://www.traditioninaction.org/SOD/SODimages2/054_SylversterOnHorse.jpg" /></span> in the Chapel of Saint Sylvester (consecrated in 1247) in the church of the <a href="/wiki/Santi_Quattro_Coronati" id="w">Santi Quattro Coronati</a> in Rome seems to represent the Pope wearing a tiara with two bands and with lappets.</p>
<p>An alternative chronology suggests that the tiara began as a sort of closed &#34;<a href="/wiki/Toque_(French)" id="w">tocque</a>&#34;. In 1130 a crown was added, symbol of sovereignty over the Papal States. <a href="/wiki/Boniface_VIII" id="w">Boniface VIII</a>, in 1301, added a second crown, at the time of the confrontation with Philip the Fair, King of France, to show that his spiritual authority was superior to any civil authority. <a href="/wiki/Benedict_XII" id="w">Benedict XII</a> in 1342 who added a third crown to symbolize the Pope&#39;s moral authority over all secular monarchs, and reaffirmed the possession of Avignon.</p>

<p>{{main}}
As with all previous popes, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Paul_VI" id="w">Pope Paul VI</a> was crowned with a tiara at the papal coronation. As happened sometimes with previous popes, a new tiara was used, donated by the city of Milan, where he was <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Milan" id="w">Archbishop</a> (and Cardinal) before his election. Quite different from earlier tiaras, it was not covered in jewels and precious gems, and was sharply cone-shaped. It was also distinctly lighter in weight than earlier tiaras.</p>
<p>At the end of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council" id="w">Second Vatican Council</a>, Pope Paul VI descended the steps of the papal throne in St Peter&#39;s Basilica and laid the tiara on the altar in a dramatic gesture of humility and as a sign of the renunciation of human glory and power in keeping with the renewed spirit of the Council. Since then, none of his successors has worn a tiara.</p>
<p>Pope Paul&#39;s tiara was presented to the <a href="/wiki/Basilica_of_the_National_Shrine_of_the_Immaculate_Conception" id="w">Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception</a> in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a> by the Apostolic Delegate to the United States on <a href="/wiki/February_6" id="w">February 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1968" id="w">1968</a> as a gesture of Pope Paul VI&#39;s affection for the Catholic Church in the United States. It is on permanent display in Memorial Hall along with the stole that <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_XXIII" id="w">Pope John XXIII</a> wore at the opening of the Second Vatican Council.</p>
<p>Pope Paul&#39;s decision to abandon the use of one of the most striking symbols of the papacy, the papal tiara, proved highly controversial with <a href="/wiki/Traditionalist_Catholic" id="w">Traditionalist Catholics</a>, many of whom continue to campaign for its re-instatement to former usage.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Some indeed branded him an <a href="/wiki/Antipope" id="w">antipope</a>, arguing that no <i>valid</i> pope would surrender the papal tiara. Among <a href="/wiki/Sedevacantist_antipope" id="w">ultratraditionalist claimants to the papacy</a>, at least <a href="/wiki/Clemente_Dom%C3%ADnguez_y_G%C3%B3mez" id="w">one</a> was crowned using a tiara, thus showing the power of its symbolism, while <a href="/wiki/Lucian_Pulvermacher" id="w">another</a> uses the tiara on his coat of arms.</p>

<p>{{main}}
<a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_I" id="w">Pope John Paul I</a> dispensed with the 1000-year-old tradition of a papal coronation and the wearing of a papal tiara, deciding not to take advantage of the mention of a coronation in Pope Paul VI&#39;s 1975 <a href="/wiki/Apostolic_Constitution" id="w">Apostolic Constitution</a> <i>Romano Pontifici Eligendo</i>, then in force: &#34;Finally, the Pontiff will be crowned by the Cardinal Protodeacon and, within an appropriate time, will take possession of the Patriarchal Archbasilica of the Lateran, in accordance with the prescribed ritual.&#34;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a passage of his Inauguration homily, quoted above, Pope John Paul II remarked that both his immediate predecessor and he himself had wished neither a coronation nor a tiara, and added: &#34;This is not the time to return to a ceremony and an object considered, wrongly, to be a symbol of the temporal power of the Popes.&#34;</p>

<p>As in the Pope Paul VI&#39;s document, the phraseology is descriptive, not prescriptive. Besides, it lays down no rules about the form of the &#34;ceremony of the inauguration of the pontificate&#34;, which could indeed take the form of a coronation. In any case, a Pope is not bound by ceremonial rules made by a predecessor, and may freely change them. </p>
<p>With the current disappearance of the papal coronation, the <a href="/wiki/British_monarchy" id="w">British monarch</a> is now the only monarch in a western country to receive a <a href="/wiki/Coronation" id="w">coronation</a>.

Pope Benedict XVI has confirmed the continued use of representations of the tiara as an official symbol of the papacy. It is still featured as one of the ornaments on the personal <a href="/wiki/Papal_Coat_of_Arms" id="w">coat of arms</a> of Popes John Paul I and John Paul II, who never used the actual object. However, John Paul II gave his official approval later in his reign to depictions of his arms without the tiara, as with the mosaic floor piece towards the entrance of St Peter&#39;s Basilica, where an ordinary mitre takes the place of the tiara. The coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI has replaced it with a mitre: &#34;The Holy Father Benedict XVI decided not to include the tiara in his official personal coat of arms. He replaced it with a simple mitre which is not, therefore, surmounted by a small <a href="/wiki/Globus_cruciger" id="w">globe and cross</a> as was the tiara&#34;.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

Although often referred to as <b>the</b> Papal Tiara, historically there have been many, and twenty-two remain in existence. Many of the earlier papal tiaras (most notably the tiaras of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Julius_II" id="w">Pope Julius II</a><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> and that attributed to <a href="/wiki/Pope_Silvester_I" id="w">Pope Saint Silvester</a>) were destroyed, dismantled or seized by invaders (most notably by <a href="/wiki/Louis_Alexandre_Berthier" id="w">Berthier&#39;s</a> army in 1798), or by popes themselves; <a href="/wiki/Pope_Clement_VII" id="w">Pope Clement VII</a> had all the tiaras and papal regalia melted down in 1527 to raise the 400,000 ducats ransom demanded by the occupying army of <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" id="w">Holy Roman Emperor</a> <a href="/wiki/Charles_V%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Charles V</a>. Over twenty silver tiaras exist, of which the earliest, the sole survivor of 1798, was made for <a href="/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XIII" id="w">Pope Gregory XIII</a> in the sixteenth century. On <a href="/wiki/March_21" id="w">March 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1800" id="w">1800</a> as Rome was in the hands of the French, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_VII" id="w">Pius VII</a> was crowned in exile, in <a href="/wiki/Venice" id="w">Venice</a>, with a <a href="/wiki/Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9" id="w">papier-mâché</a> tiara, for which ladies of Venice gave up their jewels.</p>
<p>Many tiaras were donated to the papacy by world leaders or heads of states, including Queen <a href="/wiki/Isabella_II_of_Spain" id="w">Isabella II of Spain</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_I%2C_German_Emperor" id="w">William I, German Emperor</a>, Emperor <a href="/wiki/Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria" id="w">Franz Joseph I of Austria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France" id="w">Napoleon I of France</a>. The tiara provided by the last was made from elements of former papal tiaras destroyed after the capture of Rome, and was given to Pius VII as a &#39;wedding gift&#39; to mark Napoleon&#39;s own marriage to <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9phine_de_Beauharnais" id="w">Empress Josephine</a> on the eve of his imperial coronation. Others were a gift to a newly elected pope from the See which they had held before their election, or on the occasion of the jubilee of their <a href="/wiki/Ordination" id="w">ordination</a> or election.</p>

In some instances, various cities sought to outdo each other in the beauty, value and size of the tiaras they provided to popes from their region. Examples include tiaras given to Popes John XXIII and Paul VI, the former by John&#39;s home region, the latter by Paul&#39;s previous archiepiscopal see of <a href="/wiki/Milan" id="w">Milan</a> on their election to the papacy.</p>
<p>Popes were not restricted to a particular tiara: for example, photographs on this page show Pope John XXIII, on different occasions, wearing the tiara presented to him in 1959, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_IX" id="w">Pope Pius IX&#39;s</a> 1877 tiara, and Pope Pius XI&#39;s 1922 tiara.</p>
<p>Pope Paul VI, whose bullet-shaped tiara is one of the most unusual in design, was the last pope to wear a triple tiara (though any of his successors could, if they wished, revive the custom). Most surviving tiaras are on display in the Vatican, though some were sold off or donated to Catholic bodies. Some of the more popular or historic tiaras, such as the 1871 Belgian tiara, the 1877 tiara and the 1903 golden tiara, have been sent around the world as part of a display of historic Vatican items. Pope Paul VI&#39;s &#34;Milan tiara&#34; was donated to and is on display in the crypt church of the <a href="/wiki/Basilica_of_the_National_Shrine_of_the_Immaculate_Conception" id="w">Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception</a> in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>,<a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" id="w">United States of America</a>.</p>
<a id="Shape_of_the_Triple_Tiara" name="Shape_of_the_Triple_Tiara"></a><h3>Shape of the Triple Tiara</h3>
<p>{{main}}
Most of the surviving triple tiaras have the shape of a circular <a href="/wiki/Beehive_(beekeeping)" id="w">beehive</a>, with its central core made of <a href="/wiki/Silver" id="w">silver</a>. Some were sharply conical, others bulbous. All tiaras but that of Pope Paul VI were heavily <a href="/wiki/Gemstone" id="w">bejewelled</a>. Each tiara was structured in the form of three crowns marked by golden decorations, sometimes in the form of crosses, sometimes in the shape of leaves. Most were topped off by a cross sitting above a <a href="/wiki/Monde_(crown)" id="w">monde</a> (globe), representing the universal sovereignty of Christ.</p>
<p>Each tiara had attached to the back two <a href="/wiki/Lappet" id="w">lappets</a>; highly decorated strips of cloth embroidered with golden thread, bearing the coat of arms or another symbol of the pope to whom the tiara had been given.</p>
<p>There are two rather unusual tiaras: the <a href="/wiki/Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9" id="w">papier-mâché</a> tiara made when <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_VII" id="w">Pope Pius VII</a> was elected and crowned in exile, and the one made for <a href="/wiki/Pope_Paul_VI" id="w">Pope Paul VI</a> in 1963, which is somewhat bullet-shaped, contains few jewels and, rather than having the addition of three tiers, is marked with three parallel circles.</p>
<p>The tiara given to <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_IX" id="w">Pope Pius IX</a> in 1877 by the Vatican&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Palatine_Guard" id="w">Palatine Honour guard</a> in honour of his Jubilee (see photograph below) is strikingly similar in design to the earlier tiara of Gregory XVI. It remained a particularly popular crown, worn by, among others, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_XI" id="w">Pope Pius XI</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_XII" id="w">Pope Pius XII</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_XXIII" id="w">Pope John XXIII</a>. <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_XI" id="w">Pope Pius XI</a>&#39;s 1922 crown, in contrast was much less decorated and much more conical in shape. <i>(See image below of this tiara worn by Pope John XXIII.)</i></p>
<a id="Weight" name="Weight"></a><h3>Weight</h3>
<p>Except the <a href="/wiki/Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9_Tiara" id="w">papier-mâché tiara</a>, the lightest tiara was that made for Pope John XXIII in 1959. It weighed just over 2 <a href="/wiki/Pound_(mass)" id="w">lb</a> (910 <a href="/wiki/Kilogram" id="w">g</a>), as did the 1922 tiara of Pope Pius XI. In contrast, the bullet-shaped tiara of Pope Paul VI weighed 10 lb (4.5 <a href="/wiki/Kilogram" id="w">kg</a>). The heaviest papal tiara in the papal collection is the 1804 tiara donated by <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I" id="w">Napoleon I</a> to celebrate both his marriage to Josephine and his coronation as French emperor. It weighs 8.2 kg (18.1 lb). However it was never worn, as its width was made, some suspected deliberately, too small for Pope Pius VII to wear.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A number of popes deliberately had new tiaras made because they found those in the collection either too small, too heavy, or both. Rather than use the papier-mâché tiara, Pope Gregory XVI had a new lightweight tiara made in the 1840s. In the 1870s, Pope Pius IX, then in his eighties, found the other tiaras too heavy to wear and that of his predecessor, Pope Gregory, too small, so he had a lightweight tiara made also. In 1908 Pope Pius X had another lightweight tiara made as he found that the normal tiaras in use were too heavy, while the lightweight ones did not fit comfortably.</p>
<p>New methods of manufacture in the twentieth century enabled the creation of lighter normal tiaras, producing the 900 g (2 lb) tiaras of Pius XI and John XXIII. That, combined with the existence of a range of lightweight tiaras from earlier popes, meant that no pope since Pius X in 1908 needed to make his own special lightweight tiara.</p>
<a id="Symbolism_of_the_Triple_Tiara" name="Symbolism_of_the_Triple_Tiara"></a><h2>Symbolism of the Triple Tiara</h2>
<p>There is no certainty about what the three crowns of the Triple Tiara symbolise, as is evident from the multitude of interpretations that have been and still are proposed. Some link it to the threefold authority of the &#34;Supreme <a href="/wiki/Pontiff" id="w">Pontiff</a>: Universal Pastor (top), Universal Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction (middle) and Temporal Power (bottom)&#34;.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Others interpret the three tiers as meaning &#34;Father of princes and kings, Ruler of the world, Vicar of our Saviour <a href="/wiki/Jesus" id="w">Jesus</a> Christ&#34;.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> When popes were crowned, the following words were used:
</p><dl><dd><i>Accipe thiaram tribus coronis ornatam, et scias te esse Patrem Principum et Regum, Rectorem Orbis, in terra Vicarium Salvatoris Nostri Jesu Christi, cui est honor et gloria in sæcula sæculorum.</i></dd></dl><dl><dd>(Receive the tiara adorned with three crowns and know that thou art Father of Princes and Kings, Ruler of the World, Vicar of Our Savior Jesus Christ in earth, to whom is honor and glory in the ages of ages.)</dd></dl>

A controversy touching the papal tiara, attributed to the <a href="/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church" id="w">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> and other Protestants, involves the claim that the words <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i> (Vicar of the Son of God) exist on the side of one of the tiaras. The controversy centres on the widely made claim that, when numerised (i.e., when those letters in the alleged title that have <a href="/wiki/Roman_numerals" id="w">Roman numerals</a> value are added together), the words produce the number 666, described in the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Revelation" id="w">Book of Revelation</a> as the <a href="/wiki/Number_of_the_Beast_(numerology)" id="w">Number of the Beast</a>, who, some have claimed, would &#34;wear&#34; a crown similar to a triple tiara, a claim made by some evangelical <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" id="w">Protestant</a> groups who believe that the pope as head of the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Church" id="w">Catholic Church</a> <i>is</i> the <a href="/wiki/Antichrist" id="w">Antichrist</a>. <a href="/wiki/Heresy" id="w">Heretics</a> dating back to the <a href="/wiki/Cathar" id="w">Cathars</a> and <a href="/wiki/Waldensians" id="w">Waldensians</a> in the thirteenth century also held this view of the Church.</p>
<p>&#34;Vicarius Filii Dei&#34; is, in fact, not one of the pope&#39;s titles, though the <a href="/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine" id="w">Donation of Constantine</a> (a medieval document forged in the name of the Emperor to legitimate the temporal power of popes) does use it to refer to <a href="/wiki/Saint_Peter" id="w">Saint Peter</a> specifically.</p>
<p>Four sources are sometimes given to back up the claim, including two witnesses who claimed to have seen Pope Gregory XVI wearing a tiara with <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i> on it in 1832 and 1845,<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> the purported existence of a photograph of an early twentieth century papal funeral showing a tiara with the writing, and the assertion that the tiara with the writing was used to crown Eugenio Pacelli as <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_XII" id="w">Pope Pius XII</a> in 1939.</p>
<p>None of the claims holds up to scrutiny. One of the occasions where the Pope was &#34;seen&#34; wearing the tiara was supposedly during a <a href="/wiki/Pontifical_High_Mass" id="w">Pontifical High Mass</a> in St. Peter&#39;s Basilica. In fact popes <i>never</i> wore tiaras during Mass. It was never used as a liturgical item. In addition the tiara used for Pius XII&#39;s coronation in 1939 could not have been worn by Gregory XVI as it was manufactured thirty-one years after Gregory&#39;s death. All the tiaras potentially worn by Gregory still exist; none have writing, nor does the tiara worn by Pius in 1939.</p>
<p>Finally, no evidence as to the existence of the supposed photograph has been produced, nor is it credible that a black and white photograph, taken from a distance inside a darkened <a href="/wiki/St._Peter%26%2339%3Bs_Basilica" id="w">St. Peter&#39;s Basilica</a>, in the absence of modern photographic technology or even zoom lenses, could have picked up writing on a far-away tiara, had such writing existed. A photograph of a tiara supposedly on the High Altar behind the <a href="/wiki/Coffin" id="w">coffin</a> of Pope Pius X, at his canonisation in 1954 decades after the supposed original photograph, could not see the jewels on the tiara, much less any supposed writing.

<p>Contrary to claims of a cover-up, all tiaras manufactured since 1800 still exist and are on public display, with a number being sent around the world as part of the <i><a class="externallink" href="http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/z-Patrons/MV_Patrons_03_03.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/z-Patrons/MV_Patrons_03_03.html">Saint Peter and The Vatican: The Legacy of the Popes</a></i> exhibition which visited the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> in 2005. Only a handful, notably the Belgian Tiara of 1871 and the Gold Tiara of 1903, have any writing at all. The 1871 tiara&#39;s inscription is not <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i> or anything that could be confused with it, but CHRISTI VICARIO – IN TERRA – REGUM (translated: <i>To the earthly Vicar of Christ</i>).</p>
<p>Many historians, academics and mainstream religious leaders view the story as a classic <a href="/wiki/Myths_and_legends_surrounding_the_Papacy" id="w">anti-Catholic myth</a>, a story for which no evidence has been found. Even some Seventh-day Adventist scholars no longer support the view that the &#34;666&#34; of Revelation relates to any inscription on a papal tiara.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

The triple tiara was not worn for liturgical celebrations, such as <a href="/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)" id="w">Mass</a>. At such functions the Pope, like other bishops, wears a mitre. However, one would be worn during the solemn entrance and departure processions, and one or more could be placed on the altar during the elaborately ceremonial <a href="/wiki/Pontifical_High_Mass" id="w">Pontifical High Mass</a>.</p>
<p>The tiara was thus worn in formal ceremonial processions, and on other occasions when the pope was carried on the <i><a href="/wiki/Sedia_gestatoria" id="w">sedia gestatoria</a></i>, a portable throne whose use was ended by <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II" id="w">Pope John Paul II</a> immediately after his election in October 1978. His short-lived predecessor, John Paul I, also chose initially not to use it, but relented when informed that without it the people could not see him.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> In addition, the triple tiara was used for &#34;solemn acts of jurisdiction&#34; where the pope appeared &#34;in state&#34;, for example in making an <i>ex cathedra</i> definition (using <a href="/wiki/Papal_Infallibility" id="w">Papal Infallibility</a>). It was also worn when a pope gave his traditional Christmas and Easter <i><a href="/wiki/Urbi_et_Orbi" id="w">Urbi et Orbi</a></i> blessing from the balcony of St Peter&#39;s, the only religious ceremony when the tiara was worn.</p>

The most famous occasion when the triple tiara was used was the papal coronation, a six-hour ceremony, when the new pope was carried in state on the <i><a href="/wiki/Sedia_gestatoria" id="w">sedia gestatoria</a></i> <i>(portable throne - see image of Pope John XXIII, left)</i>, with attendants fanning the pontiff with <a href="/wiki/Ostrich" id="w">ostrich</a> feathers <i>(fans can be seen in the background of photograph of Pius XI above)</i> to the location of the coronation. Traditionally, coronations took place in or in the environs of St Peter&#39;s Basilica.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the moment of the coronation, the new pope was crowned with the words 
</p><dl><dd><i>Receive the tiara adorned with three crowns and know that thou art Father of princes and kings, Ruler of the world, Vicar of our Saviour Jesus Christ.</i></dd></dl>
<p>Pope Paul VI opted for a significantly shorter ceremony. As with all other modern coronations, the ceremony itself was only symbolic, as the person involved became Pope and <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Rome" id="w">Bishop of Rome</a> the moment he accepted his canonical election in the <a href="/wiki/Papal_conclave" id="w">papal conclave</a>. The two subsequent popes (<a href="/wiki/John_Paul_I" id="w">John Paul I</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Paul_II" id="w">John Paul II</a>) abandoned the monarchial coronation, opting instead for an investiture. In 2004, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI" id="w">Pope Benedict XVI</a> took a step further and removed the tiara from the papal coat of arms, replacing it with a <a href="/wiki/Mitre" id="w">mitre</a>.</p>

<p>Only one other Catholic prelate is allowed to use a tiara in his coat of arms: the <a href="/wiki/Patriarch_of_Lisbon" id="w">Patriarch of Lisbon</a>,<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> a title created in <a href="/wiki/1716" id="w">1716</a> and held by the <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Lisbon" id="w">archbishop of Lisbon</a> since <a href="/wiki/1740" id="w">1740</a>.

<p>Conversely, the papal coronation ceremony, in which the Pope was fanned with <a href="/wiki/Flabella" id="w">flabella</a> (long fans of <a href="/wiki/Ostrich" id="w">ostrich</a> feathers) and carried on the <i><a href="/wiki/Sedia_gestatoria" id="w">sedia gestatoria</a></i> (portable throne), was based on the Byzantine imperial ceremonies witnessed in medieval <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" id="w">Constantinople</a>.</p>

<a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Medieval</a> <a href="/wiki/Tarot" id="w">tarot cards</a> included a card showing a woman wearing a papal tiara and known as the <a href="/wiki/La_Papessa" id="w">&#39;&#39;Popess or Papess&#39;&#39;</a> or the <i>High Priestess</i>. The meaning and symbolism of the card is uncertain. The crowned woman has variously been identified as <a href="/wiki/Pope_Joan" id="w">Pope Joan</a> (a woman who according to medieval legend had disguised herself as a man and been elected pope; some cards also show a child, and the Pope Joan myth pictured her as found out when she gave birth during a papal procession), as <a href="/wiki/Mary%2C_the_mother_of_Jesus" id="w">Mary, Mother of God</a>, as <a href="/wiki/Cybele" id="w">Cybele</a>, as <a href="/wiki/Isis" id="w">Isis</a>, or as <a href="/wiki/Venus_(mythology)" id="w">Venus</a>. Cards with a woman wearing a papal tiara, produced during the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" id="w">Protestant Reformation</a>, and apparent images of &#34;Pope Joan&#34; and her child, have been seen as a Protestant attempt to ridicule the papacy.</p>
