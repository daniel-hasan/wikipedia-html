<b>Luke Pryor Blackburn</b> (<a href="/wiki/June_16" id="w">June 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1816" id="w">1816</a> - <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1887" id="w">1887</a>) was a doctor and <a href="/wiki/Philanthropist" id="w">philanthropist</a> who, despite only meager previous political experience, served as <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Kentucky" id="w">Governor of Kentucky</a> from <a href="/wiki/1879" id="w">1879</a> to <a href="/wiki/1883" id="w">1883</a>. He spent much of his life combating <a href="/wiki/Yellow_fever" id="w">yellow fever</a> in the southern states and is credited with establishing the first successful <a href="/wiki/Quarantine" id="w">quarantine</a> against the spread of the disease in the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a> valley.</p>
<p>Blackburn was the first doctor elected governor of the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_(United_States)" id="w">Commonwealth</a> and was the only one until the election of <a href="/wiki/Ernie_Fletcher" id="w">Ernie Fletcher</a> in <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>.<sup id="_ref-harrison_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[1]</a></sup> His major issue as governor was <a href="/wiki/Prison_reform" id="w">prison reform</a>. He was called the &#34;father of prison reforms in Kentucky&#34; for his efforts in improving conditions in the state&#39;s penal system.<sup id="_ref-harrison_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>One incident stands in dark contrast to the rest of Blackburn&#39;s life. During the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">Civil War</a>, he deliberately shipped trunks of clothing and linens contaminated with yellow fever to Northern cities in order to begin a <a href="/wiki/Pandemic" id="w">pandemic</a> of the disease and cripple the Union economy. Though it was later discovered that <a href="/wiki/Mosquito" id="w">mosquitos</a> are responsible for the spread of yellow fever, the plot is believed to be one of the earliest attempts at <a href="/wiki/Biological_warfare" id="w">biological warfare</a> in the United States.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Luke Pryor Blackburn was born in <a href="/wiki/Woodford_County%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Woodford County, Kentucky</a> on <a href="/wiki/June_16" id="w">June 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1816" id="w">1816</a>, the fourth of thirteen children born to Edward M. (Ned) and Lavina Bell Blackburn.<sup id="_ref-baird_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> Many members of his family were involved in politics, including his distant cousin, statesman <a href="/wiki/Henry_Clay" id="w">Henry Clay</a>; his maternal grandfather, John Bell, who represented <a href="/wiki/Fayette_County%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Fayette County</a> at Kentucky&#39;s first <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_meeting)" id="w">constitutional convention</a> in 1799; his uncle <a href="/wiki/William_T._Barry" id="w">William T. Barry</a>, who served as <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Kentucky" id="w">lieutenant governor</a> under <a href="/wiki/James_Turner_Morehead_(Kentucky)" id="w">James Turner Morehead</a>; and his younger brother <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Clay_Stiles_Blackburn" id="w">Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn</a>, a congressman from Kentucky and civilian governor of the <a href="/wiki/Panama_Canal_Zone" id="w">Panama Canal Zone</a>.<sup id="_ref-baird_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> He was also a great-nephew of noted <a href="/wiki/Presbyterianism" id="w">Presbyterian</a> minister <a href="/wiki/Gideon_Blackburn" id="w">Gideon Blackburn</a>.<sup id="_ref-baird_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was, however, the profession of another relative &#8211; his uncle Churchill Blackburn, a noted physician in <a href="/wiki/Paris%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Paris, Kentucky</a> &#8211; that interested him.<sup id="_ref-baird_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> Shortly after his sixteenth birthday, young Luke began a two-year apprenticeship under his uncle, helping him minister to residents of Kentucky&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Bluegrass_region" id="w">Bluegrass region</a> during an outbreak of <a href="/wiki/Cholera" id="w">cholera</a> in 1833.<sup id="_ref-baird_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> Following his apprenticeship, Blackburn entered medical school at <a href="/wiki/Transylvania_University" id="w">Transylvania University</a>, earning an <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine" id="w">M.D.</a> in March of 1835. He then began practicing in <a href="/wiki/Lexington%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Lexington, Kentucky</a>.<sup id="_ref-baird_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_24" id="w">November 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1835" id="w">1835</a>, Blackburn married Ella Gist Boswell, the daughter of Lexington physician Joseph and Judith Bell Boswell.<sup id="_ref-powell_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[3]</a></sup> Dr. Boswell had died in the cholera outbreak two years earlier.<sup id="_ref-powell_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[3]</a></sup> Blackburn and Boswell had one son, Cary Bell.<sup id="_ref-harrison_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was during a cholera outbreak in nearby <a href="/wiki/Versailles%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Versailles, Kentucky</a> that Blackburn&#39;s reputation as a physician and philanthropist began to escalate. He often offered his services for free to ailing victims of the disease.<sup id="_ref-powell_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>After a failed business venture involving the manufacture of <a href="/wiki/Rope" id="w">rope</a> and bagging<sup id="_ref-powell_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[3]</a></sup>, Blackburn was elected as a <a href="/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Whig</a><sup id="_ref-kye_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[4]</a></sup> to the <a href="/wiki/Kentucky_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Kentucky House of Representatives</a> in 1843.<sup id="_ref-nga_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nga" title="">[5]</a></sup> Despite his family history, politics apparently did not agree with him; he refused to seek a second term, instead opening a medical practice with his brother in <a href="/wiki/Frankfort%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Frankfort, Kentucky</a>.<sup id="_ref-baird_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Growing_reputation" name="Growing_reputation"></a><h2>Growing reputation</h2>
<p>Dire health conditions and a booming economy in the Mississippi River valley drew Blackburn away from Kentucky to the city of <a href="/wiki/Natchez%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Natchez, Mississippi</a> in 1846.<sup id="_ref-baird_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> Shortly after arriving, Blackburn became the manager of the city hospital.<sup id="_ref-baird_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> The following year, he served as the city&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Environmental_health_officer" id="w">health officer</a>.<sup id="_ref-nga_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nga" title="">[5]</a></sup> In 1848 and 1853<sup id="_ref-kye_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[4]</a></sup>, he organized the first successful quarantines against the spread of yellow fever in the Mississippi Valley,<sup id="_ref-nga_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nga" title="">[5]</a></sup> bringing him national acclaim.<sup id="_ref-powell_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>His concern for boatmen working along the Mississippi River lead him to set up a hospital for them using his own money.<sup id="_ref-powell_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[3]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Mississippi" id="w">Mississippi</a> Congressman <a href="/wiki/Albert_G._Brown" id="w">Albert G. Brown</a> used Blackburn&#39;s generosity to chide <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" id="w">Congress</a> for not providing adequate medical facilities for the boatmen.<sup id="_ref-baird_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> Brown&#39;s pleas were heeded, with Congress appropriating $60,000 for the construction of six facilities along the Mississippi.<sup id="_ref-baird_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> One of these facilities was constructed in Natchez, and Blackburn was named chief physician.<sup id="_ref-baird_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>His successful quarantines in Natchez led Blackburn to lobby the <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_State_Legislature" id="w">Louisiana State Legislature</a> to establish a quarantine station along the river below <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana" id="w">New Orleans</a> to prevent the spread of yellow fever upstream.<sup id="_ref-baird_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> The measure was approved in 1855 over the protests of merchants who claimed it would hurt commerce, though the merchants&#39; considerable influence rendered it ineffective in subsequent years.<sup id="_ref-baird_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In November of 1856, Blackburn&#39;s wife Ella, who suffered from <a href="/wiki/Dropsy" id="w">dropsy</a> and a nervous condition, died of &#34;a fever.&#34;<sup id="_ref-baird_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> Grief-stricken, Blackburn was encouraged by family members to take the European trip he&#39;d often talked about taking.<sup id="_ref-baird_p" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> In 1857, Blackburn made the trip, touring the hospitals <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>, and <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>.<sup id="_ref-powell_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[3]</a></sup> While in <a href="/wiki/Paris%2C_France" id="w">Paris</a> he encountered fellow Kentuckian Julia M. Churchill. Upon returning to Kentucky in November 1857, Blackburn married Churchill.<sup id="_ref-powell_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[3]</a></sup> The couple took up residence in New Orleans.<sup id="_ref-powell_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Upon the outset of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">Civil War</a>, Blackburn, a <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" id="w">Confederate</a> sympathizer, volunteered as a citizen agent. After serving as an unsuccessful envoy to Louisiana for Kentucky Governor <a href="/wiki/Beriah_Magoffin" id="w">Beriah Magoffin</a><sup id="_ref-baird_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup>, he was assigned to the staff of General <a href="/wiki/Sterling_Price" id="w">Sterling Price</a>.<sup id="_ref-powell_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[3]</a></sup> In 1863, Blackburn was assigned by <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Mississippi" id="w">Mississippi Governor</a> <a href="/wiki/John_J._Pettus" id="w">John J. Pettus</a> to travel to <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> and collect supplies for <a href="/wiki/Blockade_runner" id="w">blockade runners</a>.<sup id="_ref-baird_r" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> Blackburn&#39;s vessel was captured by Federal forces while trying to run a blockade at <a href="/wiki/Mobile%2C_Alabama" id="w">Mobile, Alabama</a>; however, it was assumed that Blackburn was a civilian passenger, and he was released.<sup id="_ref-baird_s" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>On two separate occasions in 1864, Blackburn sailed for the Caribbean island of <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a>, where yellow fever was running amok.<sup id="_ref-baird_t" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> On both occasions, he arranged for trunks filled with linens and clothing used by his patients to be imported to Northern cities, believing yellow fever could be introduced into the area in this way.<sup id="_ref-baird_u" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> It was later alleged that some of the contaminated clothing was intended for <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" id="w">President Lincoln</a> himself.<sup id="_ref-baird_v" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In April 1865, Blackburn&#39;s plot was uncovered.<sup id="_ref-harrison_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[1]</a></sup> The U.S. Bureau of Military Justice charged him with conspiracy to commit murder, but he remained in Canada to avoid prosecution.<sup id="_ref-harrison_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[1]</a></sup> He was, however, tried in <a href="/wiki/Toronto%2C_Ontario" id="w">Toronto</a> for violating Canada&#39;s neutrality in the war, but was acquitted.<sup id="_ref-eok_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eok" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Service_as_governor" name="Service_as_governor"></a><h2>Service as governor</h2>
<p>Blackburn returned to his home state in 1872 and resumed his medical and philanthropic efforts, combating yellow fever in <a href="/wiki/Memphis%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Memphis, Tennessee</a> (1873),<sup id="_ref-kye_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[4]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Fernandina%2C_Florida" id="w">Fernandina, Florida</a> (1877),<sup id="_ref-baird_w" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Hickman%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Hickman, Kentucky</a> (1878).<sup id="_ref-kye_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[4]</a></sup> The admiration garnered through his efforts led to a successful bid to become <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Kentucky" id="w">governor of Kentucky</a> in 1879.<sup id="_ref-eok_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eok" title="">[6]</a></sup> Blackburn garnered 55.4% of the popular vote, defeating candidates Walter Evans and C. W. Cook.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Reform of Kentucky&#39;s penal system was the hallmark of Blackburn&#39;s term as governor. He appointed a commission to oversee drastic improvements at the eighty-year-old <a href="/wiki/Penitentiary" id="w">penitentiary</a> in Frankfort, ominously dubbed &#34;Kentucky&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Black_Hole_of_Calcutta" id="w">Black Hole of Calcutta</a> by some.<sup id="_ref-harrison_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[1]</a></sup> He secured funding for the <a href="/wiki/Kentucky_State_Penitentiary" id="w">Kentucky State Penitentiary</a> at <a href="/wiki/Eddyville%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Eddyville, Kentucky</a>,<sup id="_ref-kye_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[4]</a></sup> though it never became what Blackburn envisioned &#8211; a facility that would &#34;teach and train the prisoner in such a manner that on his discharge, he may be able to resist temptation and inclined to lead an upright and worthy life.&#34;<sup id="_ref-harrison_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[1]</a></sup> He also hired out convicts to work on public projects.<sup id="_ref-kye_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Blackburn financed his reform measures by increasing the state&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Property_tax" id="w">property tax</a>.<sup id="_ref-harrison_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[1]</a></sup> The use of tax dollars to improve the lot of prisoners was an unpopular action, and had prevented previous prison reform advocates from accomplishing the needed improvements. Blackburn forced the <a href="/wiki/Kentucky_General_Assembly" id="w">General Assembly</a>&#39;s hand by liberally invoking his power of <a href="/wiki/Clemency" id="w">executive pardon</a>, releasing the aged and infirm to alleviate overcrowding.<sup id="_ref-kye_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[4]</a></sup> This action earned him the nickname &#34;Lenient Luke.&#34;<sup id="_ref-harrison_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other accomplishments during Blackburn&#39;s administration included revamping the state&#39;s <a href="/wiki/United_States_district_court" id="w">district courts</a>, creating a state superior court, and reorganizing the Agricultural and Mechanical College &#8211; later, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Kentucky" id="w">University of Kentucky</a>.<sup id="_ref-harrison_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Later_life_and_legacy" name="Later_life_and_legacy"></a><h2>Later life and legacy</h2>
<p>Following the expiration of his term in 1883, Blackburn retired from politics and returned to his medical practice once again, briefly operating a <a href="/wiki/Sanitarium" id="w">sanitarium</a> in <a href="/wiki/Louisville%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Louisville, Kentucky</a>.<sup id="_ref-harrison_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[1]</a></sup> He died on <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1887" id="w">1887</a> in <a href="/wiki/Frankfort%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Frankfort, Kentucky</a>, and is buried at Frankfort Cemetery.<sup id="_ref-kye_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[4]</a></sup> His monument, erected by the state, features a <a href="/wiki/Bas-relief" id="w">bas-relief</a> depicting the <a href="/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan" id="w">Parable of the Good Samaritan</a>, a tribute to his life of service and alleviation of suffering.<sup id="_ref-harrison_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[1]</a></sup> In 1972, the state opened the <a href="/wiki/Blackburn_Correctional_Complex" id="w">Blackburn Correctional Complex</a>, a 400-acre minimum security prison near Lexington named for Governor Blackburn.<sup id="_ref-baird_x" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
