<p>A <b>comet</b> is a small body in the <a href="/wiki/Solar_System" id="w">Solar System</a> that orbits the <a href="/wiki/Sun" id="w">Sun</a> and, when close enough to the Sun, exhibits a visible <a href="/wiki/Coma_(cometary)" id="w">coma</a> (or atmosphere) and/or a tail&#160;— both primarily from the effects of solar radiation upon the comet&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Comet_nucleus" id="w">nucleus</a>. The nucleus itself measures a few kilometres or tens of kilometres across, and is composed mostly of rock, dust and ice.</p>
<p>Comets originate in the outer solar system; they are thrown inwards towards the Sun by gravitational perturbations from planets or nearby stars. They have a variety of different orbital periods, ranging from a few years, to 50 or 100 years, to thousands of years, while some are believed to pass through the inner Solar System only once before being thrown out into interstellar space. </p>
<p>Short-period comets are thought to originate in the <a href="/wiki/Kuiper_Belt" id="w">Kuiper Belt</a>, which lies beyond the orbit of <a href="/wiki/Neptune" id="w">Neptune</a>. Long-period comets are believed to originate at a very much greater distance from the Sun, in a cloud (the <a href="/wiki/Oort_cloud" id="w">Oort cloud</a>) consisting of debris left over from the <a href="/wiki/Condensation" id="w">condensation</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Solar_nebula" id="w">solar nebula</a>. <a href="/wiki/Asteroid" id="w">Asteroids</a> originate via a different process, but very old comets which have lost all their <a href="/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)" id="w">volatile</a> materials may come to resemble asteroids. </p>
<p>There are a reported 3,354 known comets as of November 2007,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> of which several hundred are short-period. This number is steadily increasing. However, this represents only a tiny fraction of the total comet population: the reservoir of comet-like bodies in the outer solar system may number one trillion.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The number of naked-eye comets averages to roughly one per year,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> though many of these are faint and unspectacular.</p>
<p>The word &#34;comet&#34; came to the <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English language</a> through <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> <i>cometes</i> from the <a href="/wiki/Greek_Language" id="w">Greek</a> word <i>komē</i>, meaning &#34;hair of the head&#34;; <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" id="w">Aristotle</a> first used the derivation <i>komētēs</i> to depict comets as &#34;stars with hair.&#34; The <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_symbol" id="w">astronomical symbol</a> for comets (<big>{{Unicode}}</big>) accordingly consists of a disc with a hairlike tail.</p>

<p>Comet nuclei are in a range from 1/2 kilometer to 50 kilometers across and are composed of rock, dust, water ice, and frozen gases such as <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" id="w">carbon monoxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" id="w">carbon dioxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Methane" id="w">methane</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" id="w">ammonia</a><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> &#8211; often described as &#34;dirty snowballs&#34;. Comets also contain a variety of <a href="/wiki/Organic_compound" id="w">organic compounds</a>; in addition to the gases already mentioned, these may include <a href="/wiki/Methanol" id="w">methanol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide" id="w">hydrogen cyanide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Formaldehyde" id="w">formaldehyde</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" id="w">ethanol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ethane" id="w">ethane</a>, and perhaps more complex molecules such as long-chain <a href="/wiki/Hydrocarbons" id="w">hydrocarbons</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amino_acids" id="w">amino acids</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Comet nuclei are irregularly shaped: they have insufficient mass (and hence gravity) to become spherical. </p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Outer_solar_system" id="w">outer solar system</a>, comets remain frozen and are extremely difficult or impossible to detect from Earth due to their small size (though some observations of comet nuclei in the Kuiper Belt have been made<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>). As a comet approaches the <a href="/wiki/Inner_solar_system" id="w">inner solar system</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_radiation" id="w">solar radiation</a> causes the water, frozen gases and other volatile materials within the comet to vaporise and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. The streams of <a href="/wiki/Cosmic_dust" id="w">dust</a> and gas thus released form a huge, extremely tenuous atmosphere around the comet called the <i><a href="/wiki/Coma_(cometary)" id="w">coma</a></i>, and the force exerted on the coma by the Sun&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Radiation_pressure" id="w">radiation pressure</a> and <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" id="w">solar wind</a> cause an enormous <i>tail</i> to form, which points away from the sun. </p>
<p>The streams of dust and gas each form their own distinct tail, pointing in slightly different directions. The tail of dust is left behind in the comet&#39;s orbit in such a manner that it often forms a curved tail. At the same time, the ion tail, made of gases, always points directly away from the Sun, as this gas is more strongly affected by the solar wind than is dust, following magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory. While the solid nucleus of comets is generally less than 50&#160;km across, the coma may be larger than the Sun, and ion tails have been observed to extend 1 <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_unit" id="w">astronomical unit</a> (150 million km) or more.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Both the coma and tail are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from <a href="/wiki/Earth" id="w">Earth</a> when a comet passes through the inner solar system, the dust reflecting sunlight directly and the gases glowing from <a href="/wiki/Ion" id="w">ionisation</a>. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a <a href="/wiki/Telescope" id="w">telescope</a>, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible with the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma temporarily greatly increases in size. This happened in 2007 to <a href="/wiki/17P/Holmes" id="w">Comet Holmes</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually &#8211; typically after many orbits of the Sun &#8211; all the volatile material contained in a comet nucleus evaporates away, and the comet either disintegrates into a trail of dust or becomes a small, dark, inert lump of rock or rubble.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Some comets meet a more spectacular end &#8211; either falling into the Sun,<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> or smashing into a planet (as happened to <a href="/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker-Levy_9" id="w">Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</a>).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, cometary nuclei are among the <a href="/wiki/Dark" id="w">darkest</a> objects known to exist in the solar system. The <a href="/wiki/Giotto_mission" id="w">Giotto</a> probe found that <a href="/wiki/Halley%26%2339%3Bs_Comet" id="w">Comet Halley&#39;s</a> nucleus reflects approximately 4% of the light that falls on it, and <a href="/wiki/Deep_Space_1" id="w">Deep Space 1</a> discovered that <a href="/wiki/19P/Borrelly" id="w">Comet Borrelly&#39;s</a> surface reflects only 2.4% to 3% of the light that falls on it; by comparison, <a href="/wiki/Asphalt" id="w">asphalt</a> reflects 7% of the light that falls on it. It is thought that complex organic compounds are the dark surface material. Solar heating drives off volatile compounds leaving behind heavy long-chain organics that tend to be very dark, like <a href="/wiki/Tar" id="w">tar</a> or crude <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" id="w">oil</a>. The very darkness of cometary surfaces allows them to absorb the heat necessary to drive their outgassing.</p>
<p>In 1996, comets were found to emit <a href="/wiki/X-rays" id="w">X-rays</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> These X-rays surprised researchers, because their emission by comets had not previously been predicted. The X-rays are thought to be generated by the interaction between comets and the solar wind: when highly charged <a href="/wiki/Ions" id="w">ions</a> fly through a cometary atmosphere, they collide with cometary atoms and molecules. In these collisions, the ions will capture one or more electrons leading to emission of X-rays and far ultraviolet photons.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many scientists believe that comets bombarding the young Earth (about 4 billion years ago) brought the vast quantities of water that now fill the Earth&#39;s oceans, or at least a significant proportion of it. Some researchers have cast doubt on this theory, however.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The detection of organic molecules in comets has led some to speculate that comets and/or meteorites may have brought the precursors of life &#8211; or even life itself &#8211; to Earth.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

Most comets have elongated <a href="/wiki/Elliptical_orbit" id="w">elliptical orbits</a> that take them close to the Sun for a part of their orbit, and then out into the further reaches of the Solar System for the remainder. Comets are often classified according to the length of their <a href="/wiki/Orbital_period" id="w">orbital period</a>; the longer the period the more elongated the ellipse.</p>

<ul>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Short-period_comet" id="w">Short-period comets</a></i> are generally defined as having orbital periods of less than 200 years. They usually orbit more-or-less in the <a href="/wiki/Ecliptic" id="w">ecliptic</a> plane in the same direction as the planets. Their orbits typically take them out to the region of the outer planets (Jupiter and beyond) at <a href="/wiki/Aphelion" id="w">aphelion</a>; for example, <a href="/wiki/Comet_Halley" id="w">Comet Halley</a>&#39;s aphelion is a little way beyond the orbit of <a href="/wiki/Neptune" id="w">Neptune</a>. At the shorter extreme, <a href="/wiki/Comet_Encke" id="w">Comet Encke</a> has an orbit which never places it farther from the Sun than <a href="/wiki/Jupiter_(planet)" id="w">Jupiter</a>. Short-period comets are further divided into the Jupiter family (periods less than 20 years) and Halley family (periods between 20 and 200 years). </li></ul>

<ul>
<li><i>Long-period comets</i> have highly <a href="/wiki/Eccentricity_(orbit)" id="w">eccentric</a> (elongated) orbits and periods ranging from 200 years to thousands or even millions of years. (However, by definition they remain gravitationally bound to the Sun; those comets that are ejected from the solar system due to close passes by major planets are no longer properly considered as having &#34;periods&#34;.) Their orbits take them far beyond the outer planets at aphelia, and the plane of their orbits need not lie near the ecliptic.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><i>Single-apparition comets</i> are similar to long-period comets, but have <a href="/wiki/Parabolic_trajectory" id="w">parabolic</a> or <a href="/wiki/Hyperbolic_trajectory" id="w">hyperbolic</a> trajectories which will cause them to permanently exit the solar system after passing the Sun once. </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Some authorities use the term <i>periodic comet</i> to refer to any comet with a periodic orbit (that is, all short-period comets plus all long-period comets),<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> while others use it to mean exclusively short-period comets.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Similarly, although the literal meaning of <i>non-periodic comet</i> is the same as <i>single-apparition comet</i>, some use it to mean all comets that are not &#34;periodic&#34; in the second sense (that is, to also include all comets with a period greater than 200 years). </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Recently-discovered <i><a href="/wiki/Main-belt_comets" id="w">main-belt comets</a></i> form a distinct class, orbiting in more circular orbits within the <a href="/wiki/Asteroid_belt" id="w">asteroid belt</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>Based on their orbital characteristics, short-period comets are thought to originate in the <a href="/wiki/Kuiper_belt" id="w">Kuiper belt</a> &#8211; a disk of objects in the transneptunian region &#8211; whereas the source of long-period comets is thought to be the far more distant spherical <a href="/wiki/Oort_cloud" id="w">Oort cloud</a> (after the Dutch astronomer <a href="/wiki/Jan_Hendrik_Oort" id="w">Jan Hendrik Oort</a> who hypothesised its existence).<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Vast swarms of comet-like bodies are believed to orbit the Sun in these distant regions in roughly circular orbits. Occasionally the gravitational influence of the outer planets (in the case of Kuiper Belt objects) or nearby stars (in the case of Oort cloud objects) may throw one of these bodies into an elliptical orbit that takes it inwards towards the <a href="/wiki/Sun" id="w">Sun</a>, to form a visible comet. Unlike the return of periodic comets whose orbits have been established by previous observations, the appearance of new comets by this mechanism is unpredictable.</p>
<p>Since their elliptical orbits frequently take them close to the giant planets, comets are often subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short period comets display a tendency for their <a href="/wiki/Apsis" id="w">aphelia</a> to coincide with a <a href="/wiki/Giant_planet" id="w">giant planet</a>&#39;s orbital radius, with the Jupiter family of comets being the largest, as the <a href="/wiki/Histogram" id="w">histogram</a> shows. It is clear that comets coming in from the Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets as a result of a close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined, in addition to being the swiftest of the giant planets. These perturbations may sometimes deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods (<a href="/wiki/Halley%26%2339%3Bs_Comet" id="w">Halley&#39;s Comet</a> being a possible example).</p>
<p>Early observations have revealed a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, but no more than could be accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded interstellar space, they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of kilometres per second). If such objects entered the solar system, they would have positive total energies, and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows that there might be four hyperbolic comets per century, within Jupiter&#39;s orbit, give or take one and perhaps two orders of magnitude. </p>
<p>A number of periodic comets discovered in earlier decades or previous centuries are now &#34;lost.&#34; Their orbits were never known well enough to predict future appearances. However, occasionally a &#34;new&#34; comet will be discovered and upon calculation of its orbit it turns out to be an old &#34;lost&#34; comet. An example is Comet <a href="/wiki/11P/Tempel-Swift-LINEAR" id="w">11P/Tempel-Swift-LINEAR</a>, discovered in 1869 but unobservable after 1908 because of perturbations by Jupiter. It was not found again until accidentally rediscovered by <a href="/wiki/LINEAR" id="w">LINEAR</a> in 2001.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Comet_nomenclature" name="Comet_nomenclature"></a><h2>Comet nomenclature</h2>
<p>The names given to comets have followed several different conventions over the past two centuries. Before any systematic naming convention was adopted, comets were named in a variety of ways. Prior to the early 20th century, most comets were simply referred to by the year in which they appeared, sometimes with additional adjectives for particularly bright comets; thus, the &#34;<a href="/wiki/C/1680_V1" id="w">Great Comet of 1680</a>&#34; (Kirch&#39;s Comet), the &#34;<a href="/wiki/C/1882_R1" id="w">Great September Comet of 1882</a>,&#34; and the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Great_Daylight_Comet_of_1910" id="w">Daylight Comet of 1910</a>&#34; (&#34;Great January Comet of 1910&#34;). After <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Halley" id="w">Edmund Halley</a> demonstrated that the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 were the same body and successfully predicted its return in 1759, that comet became known as <a href="/wiki/Comet_Halley" id="w">Comet Halley</a>. Similarly, the second and third known periodic comets, <a href="/wiki/Comet_Encke" id="w">Comet Encke</a><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Comet_Biela" id="w">Comet Biela</a>,<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> were named after the astronomers who calculated their orbits rather than their original discoverers. Later, periodic comets were usually named after their discoverers, but comets that had appeared only once continued to be referred to by the year of their apparition.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, the convention of naming comets after their discoverers became common, and this remains so today. A comet is named after up to three independent discoverers. In recent years, many comets have been discovered by instruments operated by large teams of astronomers, and in this case, comets may be named for the instrument. For example, <a href="/wiki/Comet_IRAS-Araki-Alcock" id="w">Comet IRAS-Araki-Alcock</a> was discovered independently by the <a href="/wiki/IRAS" id="w">IRAS</a> satellite and amateur astronomers <a href="/wiki/Genichi_Araki" id="w">Genichi Araki</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_Alcock" id="w">George Alcock</a>. In the past, when multiple comets were discovered by the same individual, group of individuals, or team, the comets&#39; names were distinguished by adding a numeral to the discoverers&#39; names (but only for periodic comets); thus Comets <a href="/wiki/P/1990_V1" id="w">Shoemaker-Levy 1</a>–<a href="/wiki/D/1993_F2" id="w">9</a>. Today, the large numbers of comets discovered by some instruments (in August 2005, <a href="/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory" id="w">SOHO</a> discovered its 1000th comet<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup>) has rendered this system impractical, and no attempt is made to ensure that each comet has a unique name. Instead, the comets&#39; systematic designations are used to avoid confusion.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>Until 1994, comets were first given a <a href="/wiki/Provisional_designation" id="w">provisional designation</a> consisting of the year of their discovery followed by a lowercase letter indicating its order of discovery in that year (for example, <a href="/wiki/C/1969_Y1" id="w">Comet 1969i (Bennett)</a> was the 9th comet discovered in 1969). Once the comet had been observed through perihelion and its orbit had been established, the comet was given a permanent designation of the year of its <a href="/wiki/Perihelion" id="w">perihelion</a>, followed by a <a href="/wiki/Roman_numeral" id="w">Roman numeral</a> indicating its order of perihelion passage in that year, so that Comet 1969i became <a href="/wiki/C/1969_Y1" id="w">Comet 1970 II</a> (it was the second comet to pass perihelion in 1970)<sup id="_ref-arnett_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-arnett" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Increasing numbers of comet discoveries made this procedure awkward, and in 1994 the <a href="/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union" id="w">International Astronomical Union</a> approved a new naming system. Comets are now designated by the year of their discovery followed by a letter indicating the half-month of the discovery and a number indicating the order of discovery (a system similar to that already used for <a href="/wiki/Asteroid" id="w">asteroids</a>), so that the fourth comet discovered in the second half of February 2006 would be designated 2006&#160;D4. Prefixes are also added to indicate the nature of the comet:</p>

<ul>
<li>P/ indicates a periodic comet (defined for these purposes as any comet with an orbital period of less than 200 years or confirmed observations at more than one perihelion passage);</li>
<li>C/ indicates a non-periodic comet (defined as any comet that is <i>not</i> periodic according to the preceding definition);</li>
<li>X/ indicates a comet for which no reliable orbit could be calculated (generally, historical comets);</li>
<li>D/ indicates a comet which has broken up or been lost;</li>
<li>A/ indicates an object that was mistakenly identified as a comet, but is actually a <a href="/wiki/Minor_planet" id="w">minor planet</a>. </li></ul>

<p>Before the invention of the telescope, comets seemed to appear out of nowhere in the sky and gradually vanish out of sight. They were usually considered bad <a href="/wiki/Omen" id="w">omens</a> of deaths of kings or noble men, or coming catastrophes, or even interpreted as attacks by heavenly beings against terrestrial inhabitants. From ancient sources, such as Chinese <a href="/wiki/Oracle_bone" id="w">oracle bones</a>, it is known that their appearances have been noticed by humans for millennia. Some authorities interpret references to &#34;falling stars&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Gilgamesh" id="w">Gilgamesh</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Revelation" id="w">Book of Revelation</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Enoch" id="w">Book of Enoch</a> as references to comets, or possibly <a href="/wiki/Bolide" id="w">bolides</a>.</p>
<p>In the first book of his <i><a href="/wiki/Meteorology" id="w">Meteorology</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" id="w">Aristotle</a> propounded the view of comets that would hold sway in Western thought for nearly two thousand years. He rejected the ideas of several earlier philosophers that comets were <a href="/wiki/Planet" id="w">planets</a>, or at least a phenomenon related to the planets, on the grounds that while the planets confined their motion to the circle of the <a href="/wiki/Zodiac" id="w">Zodiac</a>, comets could appear in any part of the sky.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Instead, he described comets as a phenomenon of the upper <a href="/wiki/Earth%26%2339%3Bs_atmosphere" id="w">atmosphere</a>, where hot, dry exhalations gathered and occasionally burst into flame. Aristotle held this mechanism responsible for not only comets, but also <a href="/wiki/Meteor" id="w">meteors</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Aurora_borealis" id="w">aurora borealis</a>, and even the <a href="/wiki/Milky_Way" id="w">Milky Way</a>.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>A few later classical philosophers did dispute this view of comets. <a href="/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger" id="w">Seneca the Younger</a>, in his <i><a href="/wiki/Natural_Questions" id="w">Natural Questions</a></i>, observed that comets moved regularly through the sky and were undisturbed by the wind, behavior more typical of celestial than atmospheric phenomena. While he conceded that the other planets do not appear outside the Zodiac, he saw no reason that a planet-like object could not move through any part of the sky, humanity&#39;s knowledge of celestial things being very limited.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> However, the Aristotelian viewpoint proved more influential, and it was not until the 16th century that it was demonstrated that comets must exist outside the earth&#39;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>One very famous old recording of a comet is the appearance of <a href="/wiki/Halley%26%2339%3Bs_Comet" id="w">Halley&#39;s Comet</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Bayeux_Tapestry" id="w">Bayeux Tapestry</a>, which records the <a href="/wiki/Norman_conquest" id="w">Norman conquest</a> of <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> in AD 1066.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1577, a bright comet was visible for several months. The Danish astronomer <a href="/wiki/Tycho_Brahe" id="w">Tycho Brahe</a> used measurements of the comet&#39;s position taken by himself and other, geographically separated, observers to determine that the comet had no measurable <a href="/wiki/Parallax" id="w">parallax</a>.

<p>Although comets had now been demonstrated to be in the heavens, the question of how they moved through the heavens would be debated for most of the next century. Even after <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Kepler" id="w">Johannes Kepler</a> had determined in 1609 that the planets moved about the sun in <a href="/wiki/Ellipse" id="w">elliptical</a> orbits, he was reluctant to believe that the <a href="/wiki/Kepler%26%2339%3Bs_laws" id="w">laws that governed the motions of the planets</a> should also influence the motion of other bodies—he believed that comets travel among the planets along straight lines. <a href="/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" id="w">Galileo Galilei</a>, although a staunch <a href="/wiki/Copernicus" id="w">Copernicanist</a>, rejected Tycho&#39;s parallax measurements and held to the Aristotelian notion of comets moving on straight lines through the upper atmosphere.<sup id="_ref-Prasar part II_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Prasar part II" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first suggestion that Kepler&#39;s laws of planetary motion should also apply to the comets was made by <a href="/wiki/William_Lower" id="w">William Lower</a> in 1610.<sup id="_ref-ESO part I_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ESO part I" title="">[32]</a></sup> In the following decades other astronomers, including <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Petit" id="w">Pierre Petit</a>, <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Borelli" id="w">Giovanni Borelli</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adrien_Auzout" id="w">Adrien Auzout</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Hooke" id="w">Robert Hooke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Johann_Baptist_Cysat" id="w">Johann Baptist Cysat</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini" id="w">Giovanni Domenico Cassini</a> all argued for comets curving about the sun on elliptical or parabolic paths, while others, such as <a href="/wiki/Christian_Huygens" id="w">Christian Huygens</a> and <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Hevelius" id="w">Johannes Hevelius</a>, supported comets&#39; linear motion.<sup id="_ref-Prasar part II_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Prasar part II" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>The matter was resolved by the <a href="/wiki/C/1680_V1" id="w">bright comet</a> that was discovered by <a href="/wiki/Gottfried_Kirch" id="w">Gottfried Kirch</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_14" id="w">November 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1680" id="w">1680</a>. Astronomers throughout Europe tracked its position for several months. In 1681, the <a href="/wiki/Saxony" id="w">Saxon</a> pastor <a href="/wiki/Georg_Samuel_Doerfel" id="w">Georg Samuel Doerfel</a> set forth his proofs that comets are heavenly bodies moving in <a href="/wiki/Parabola" id="w">parabolas</a> of which the sun is the focus. Then <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Newton" id="w">Isaac Newton</a>, in his <i><a href="/wiki/Philosophiae_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica" id="w">Principia Mathematica</a></i> of 1687, proved that an object moving under the influence of his <a href="/wiki/Inverse_square_law" id="w">inverse square law</a> of <a href="/wiki/Gravity" id="w">universal gravitation</a> must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the <a href="/wiki/Conic_section" id="w">conic sections</a>, and he demonstrated how to fit a comet&#39;s path through the sky to a parabolic orbit, using the comet of 1680 as an example.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1705, <a href="/wiki/Edmond_Halley" id="w">Edmond Halley</a> applied Newton&#39;s method to twenty-four cometary apparitions that had occurred between 1337 and 1698. He noted that three of these, the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682, had very similar <a href="/wiki/Orbital_element" id="w">orbital elements</a>, and he was further able to account for the slight differences in their orbits in terms of gravitational perturbation by <a href="/wiki/Jupiter_(planet)" id="w">Jupiter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saturn_(planet)" id="w">Saturn</a>. Confident that these three apparitions had been three appearances of the same comet, he predicted that it would appear again in 1758–9.<sup id="_ref-Halley_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Halley" title="">[35]</a></sup> (Earlier, Robert Hooke had identified the comet of 1664 with that of 1618,<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> while Jean-Dominique Cassini had suspected the identity of the comets of 1577, 1665, and 1680.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> Both were incorrect.) Halley&#39;s predicted return date was later refined by a team of three <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a> mathematicians: <a href="/wiki/Alexis_Clairaut" id="w">Alexis Clairaut</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Lalande" id="w">Joseph Lalande</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Nicole-Reine_Lepaute" id="w">Nicole-Reine Lepaute</a>, who predicted the date of the comet&#39;s 1759 perihelion to within one month&#39;s accuracy.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> When the comet returned as predicted, it became known as <a href="/wiki/Comet_Halley" id="w">Comet Halley</a> or Halley&#39;s Comet (its official designation is <b>1P/Halley</b>). Its next appearance will be in 2061.</p>
<p>Among the comets with short enough periods to have been observed several times in the historical record, Comet Halley is unique in consistently being bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Since the confirmation of Comet Halley&#39;s periodicity, many other periodic comets have been discovered through the <a href="/wiki/Telescope" id="w">telescope</a>. The second comet to be discovered to have a periodic orbit was <a href="/wiki/Comet_Encke" id="w">Comet Encke</a> (official designation <b>2P/Encke</b>). Over the period 1819–1821 the <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> mathematician and physicist <a href="/wiki/Johann_Franz_Encke" id="w">Johann Franz Encke</a> computed orbits for a series of cometary apparitions observed in 1786, 1795, 1805, and 1818, concluded that they were same comet, and successfully predicted its return in 1822.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> By 1900, seventeen comets had been observed at more than one perihelion passage and recognized as periodic comets. As of April 2006, 175 comets have achieved this distinction, though several have since been destroyed or lost. In <a href="/wiki/Ephemerides" id="w">ephemerides</a>, comets are often denoted by the symbol {{unicode}}.</p>

<a href="/wiki/Isaac_Newton" id="w">Isaac Newton</a> described comets as compact and durable solid bodies moving in oblique orbits, and their tails as thin streams of vapor emitted by their <a href="/wiki/Comet_nucleus" id="w">nuclei</a>, ignited or heated by the sun. Newton suspected that comets were the origin of the life-supporting component of air. Newton also believed that the vapors given off by comets might replenish the planets&#39; supplies of water (which was gradually being converted into soil by the growth and decay of plants), and the sun&#39;s supply of fuel —</p>
<p>{{cquote2}}</p>
<p>As early as the 18th century, some scientists had made correct hypotheses as to comets&#39; physical composition. In 1755, <a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" id="w">Immanuel Kant</a> hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance, whose vaporization gives rise to their brilliant displays near perihelion.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> In 1836, the German mathematician <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Bessel" id="w">Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel</a>, after observing streams of vapor in the 1835 apparition of Comet Halley, proposed that the <a href="/wiki/Jet_force" id="w">jet forces</a> of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet&#39;s orbit and argued that the non-gravitational movements of <a href="/wiki/Comet_Encke" id="w">Comet Encke</a> resulted from this mechanism.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, another comet-related discovery overshadowed these ideas for nearly a century. Over the period 1864–1866 the <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italian</a> astronomer <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Schiaparelli" id="w">Giovanni Schiaparelli</a> computed the orbit of the <a href="/wiki/Perseids" id="w">Perseid</a> <a href="/wiki/Meteor" id="w">meteors</a>, and based on orbital similarities, correctly hypothesized that the Perseids were fragments of <a href="/wiki/Comet_Swift-Tuttle" id="w">Comet Swift-Tuttle</a>. The link between comets and meteor showers was dramatically underscored when in 1872, a major meteor shower occurred from the orbit of <a href="/wiki/Comet_Biela" id="w">Comet Biela</a>, which had been observed to split into two pieces during its 1846 apparition, and was never seen again after 1852.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> A &#34;gravel bank&#34; model of comet structure arose, according to which comets consist of loose piles of small rocky objects, coated with an icy layer.</p>
<p>By the middle of the twentieth century, this model suffered from a number of shortcomings: in particular, it failed to explain how a body that contained only a little ice could continue to put on a brilliant display of evaporating vapor after several perihelion passages. In 1950, <a href="/wiki/Fred_Lawrence_Whipple" id="w">Fred Lawrence Whipple</a> proposed that rather than being rocky objects containing some ice, comets were icy objects containing some dust and rock.<sup id="_ref-Whipple_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whipple" title="">[43]</a></sup> This &#34;dirty snowball&#34; model soon became accepted. It was confirmed when an armada of <a href="/wiki/Spacecraft" id="w">spacecraft</a> (including the <a href="/wiki/European_Space_Agency" id="w">European Space Agency</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Giotto_mission" id="w">Giotto</a></i> probe and the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Vega_1" id="w">Vega 1</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Vega_2" id="w">Vega 2</a></i>) flew through the coma of Halley&#39;s comet in 1986 to photograph the nucleus and observed the jets of evaporating material. The American probe <i><a href="/wiki/Deep_Space_1" id="w">Deep Space 1</a></i> flew past the nucleus of <a href="/wiki/19P/Borrelly" id="w">Comet Borrelly</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_21" id="w">September 21</a> <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a> and confirmed that the characteristics of Comet Halley are common on other comets as well.</p>
<p>Although comets formed in the outer Solar System, radial mixing of material during the early formation of the Solar System is thought to have redistributed material throughout the proto-planetary disk,<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> so comets also contain crystalline grains which were formed in the hot inner Solar System.

Claudia Alexander, a program scientist for Rosetta from NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who has modeled comets for years, reported to space.com about her astonishment at the number of jets, their appearance on the dark side of the comet as well as on the light side, their ability to lift large chunks of rock from the surface of the comet and the fact that comet Wild 2 is not a loosely-cemented rubble pile.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>Forthcoming space missions will add greater detail to our understanding of what comets are made of. In July 2005, the <a href="/wiki/Deep_Impact_(space_mission)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Deep Impact&#39;&#39;</a> probe blasted a crater on <a href="/wiki/9P/Tempel" id="w">Comet Tempel 1</a> to study its interior.

<p>Rosetta observed the Deep Impact event, and with its set of very sensitive instruments for cometary investigations, it used its capabilities to observe Tempel 1 before, during and after the impact.

As late as 2002, there is conflict on how much ice is in a comet. NASA&#39;s Deep Space 1 team, working at NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Lab, obtained high-resolution images of the surface of comet Borrelly. They announced that comet Borrelly exhibits distinct jets, yet has a hot, dry surface. The assumption that comets contain water and other ices led Dr. Laurence Soderblom of the U.S. Geological Survey to say, &#34;The spectrum suggests that the surface is hot and dry. It is surprising that we saw no traces of water ice.&#34; However, he goes on to suggest that the ice is probably hidden below the crust as &#34;either the surface has been dried out by solar heating and maturation or perhaps the very dark soot-like material that covers Borrelly&#39;s surface masks any trace of surface ice&#34;.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>The recent <a href="/wiki/Deep_Impact_(space_mission)" id="w">Deep Impact</a> probe has also yielded results suggesting that the majority of a comet&#39;s water ice is below the surface, and that these reservoirs feed the jets of vaporised water that form the coma of Tempel 1.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>

<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>While hundreds of tiny comets pass through the inner solar system every year, very few are noticed by the general public. About every decade or so, a comet will become bright enough to be noticed by a casual observer — such comets are often designated <a href="/wiki/Great_Comet" id="w">Great Comets</a>. In times past, bright comets often inspired panic and hysteria in the general population, being thought of as bad omens. More recently, during the passage of <a href="/wiki/Halley%26%2339%3Bs_Comet" id="w">Halley&#39;s Comet</a> in 1910, the Earth passed through the comet&#39;s tail, and erroneous newspaper reports inspired a fear that <a href="/wiki/Cyanogen" id="w">cyanogen</a> in the tail might poison millions, while the appearance of <a href="/wiki/Comet_Hale-Bopp" id="w">Comet Hale-Bopp</a> in 1997 triggered the mass suicide of the <a href="/wiki/Heaven%26%2339%3Bs_Gate_(cult)" id="w">Heaven&#39;s Gate</a> cult. To most people, however, a great comet is simply a beautiful spectacle.</p>
<p>Predicting whether a comet will become a great comet is notoriously difficult, as many factors may cause a comet&#39;s brightness to depart drastically from predictions. Broadly speaking, if a comet has a large and active nucleus, will pass close to the Sun, and is not obscured by the Sun as seen from the Earth when at its brightest, it will have a chance of becoming a great comet. However, <a href="/wiki/Comet_Kohoutek" id="w">Comet Kohoutek</a> in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular, but failed to do so. <a href="/wiki/Comet_West" id="w">Comet West</a>, which appeared three years later, had much lower expectations (perhaps because scientists were much warier of glowing predictions after the Kohoutek fiasco), but became an extremely impressive comet.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>The late 20th century saw a lengthy gap without the appearance of any great comets, followed by the arrival of two in quick succession — <a href="/wiki/Comet_Hyakutake" id="w">Comet Hyakutake</a> in 1996, followed by Hale-Bopp, which reached maximum brightness in 1997 having been discovered two years earlier. The first great comet of the 21st century was <a href="/wiki/C/2006_P1" id="w">Comet McNaught</a>, which became visible to naked eye observers in January 2007.

<div class="thumbcaption">The <a href="/wiki/Great_Comet_of_1882" id="w">Great Comet of 1882</a>, is a member of the <a href="/wiki/Kreutz_Sungrazers" id="w">Kreutz group</a></div></div>
</p>
<p>A Sungrazing comet is a comet that passes extremely close to the Sun at perihelion, sometimes within a few thousand kilometres of the Sun&#39;s surface. While small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach to the <a href="/wiki/Sun" id="w">Sun</a>, larger sungrazers can survive many <a href="/wiki/Perihelion" id="w">perihelion</a> passages. However, the strong <a href="/wiki/Tidal_forces" id="w">tidal forces</a> they experience often lead to their fragmentation.</p>
<p>About 90% of the sungrazers observed with <a href="/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory" id="w">SOHO</a> are members of the <a href="/wiki/Kreutz_Sungrazers" id="w">Kreutz group</a>, which all originate from one giant comet that broke up into many smaller comets during its first passage through the <a href="/wiki/Inner_solar_system" id="w">inner solar system</a>,<sup id="_ref-Bailey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bailey" title="">[49]</a></sup> The other 10% contains some sporadic sungrazers, but four other related groups of comets have been identified among them: the Kracht, Kracht 2a, Marsden and Meyer groups. The Marsden and Kracht groups both appear to be related to <a href="/wiki/96P/Machholz" id="w">Comet 96P/Machholz</a>, which is also the parent of two <a href="/wiki/Meteor_shower" id="w">meteor streams</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Quadrantids" id="w">Quadrantids</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Arietids" id="w">Arietids</a>.<sup id="_ref-Ohtsuka_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ohtsuka" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Unusual_comets" name="Unusual_comets"></a><h3>Unusual comets</h3>
<p>Of the thousands of known comets, some are very unusual. <a href="/wiki/Comet_Encke" id="w">Comet Encke</a> orbits from outside the main asteroid belt to inside the orbit of <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(planet)" id="w">Mercury</a> while Comet <a href="/wiki/29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann" id="w">29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann</a> orbits in a nearly circular orbit entirely between Jupiter and <a href="/wiki/Saturn_(planet)" id="w">Saturn</a>.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/2060_Chiron" id="w">2060 Chiron</a>, whose unstable orbit keeps it between Saturn and <a href="/wiki/Uranus_(planet)" id="w">Uranus</a>, was originally classified as an asteroid until a faint coma was noticed.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> Similarly, <a href="/wiki/137P/Shoemaker-Levy" id="w">Comet Shoemaker-Levy 2</a> was originally designated asteroid {{mpl}}.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> Some <a href="/wiki/Near-earth_asteroid" id="w">near-earth asteroids</a> are thought to be extinct nuclei of comets which no longer experience outgassing.</p>
<p>Some comets have been observed to break up during their perihelion passage, including great comets West and <a href="/wiki/Comet_Ikeya-Seki" id="w">Comet Ikeya-Seki</a>. <a href="/wiki/3D/Biela" id="w">Comet Biela</a> was one significant example, breaking into two during its 1846 perihelion passage. The two comets were seen separately in 1852, but never again afterward. Instead, spectacular <a href="/wiki/Meteor_showers" id="w">meteor showers</a> were seen in 1872 and 1885 when the comet should have been visible. A lesser meteor shower, the <a href="/wiki/Andromedids" id="w">Andromedids</a>, occurs annually in November, and is caused by the Earth crossing Biela&#39;s orbit.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another significant cometary disruption was that of <a href="/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker-Levy_9" id="w">Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</a>, which was discovered in 1993. At the time of its discovery, the comet was in orbit around Jupiter, having been captured by the planet during a very close approach in 1992.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> This close approach had already broken the comet into hundreds of pieces, and over a period of 6 days in July 1994, these pieces slammed into Jupiter&#39;s atmosphere — the first time astronomers had observed a collision between two objects in the solar system.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> It has also been suggested that the object likely to have been responsible for the <a href="/wiki/Tunguska_event" id="w">Tunguska event</a> in 1908 was a fragment of Comet Encke.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>

<p>A new comet may be discovered photographically using a wide-field telescope or visually with binoculars. However, even without access to optical equipment, it is still possible for the amateur astronomer to discover a Sun-grazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as <a href="/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory" id="w">SOHO</a><sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Comets visible to the naked eye are fairly infrequent, but comets that put on fine displays in amateur class telescopes (50&#160;mm to 100&#160;cm) occur fairly often--as often as several times a year, occasionally with more than one in the sky at the same time. Commonly available astronomical software will plot the orbits of these known comets. They are fast compared to other objects in the sky, but their movement is usually subtle in the eyepiece of a telescope. However, from night to night, they can move several degrees, which is why observers find it useful to have a sky chart such as the one in the adjoining illustration. The type of display presented by the comet depends on its composition and how close it comes to the sun. Because the volatility of a comet&#39;s material decreases as it gets further from the sun, the comet becomes increasingly difficult to observe as a function of not only distance, but the progressive shrinking and eventual disappearance of its tail and the reflective elements it carries. Comets are most interesting when their nucleus is bright and they display a long tail, which to be seen sometimes requires a large field of view best provided by smaller telescopes. Therefore, large amateur instruments (apertures of 25&#160;cm or larger) that have fainter light grasp do not necessarily confer an advantage in terms of viewing comets. The opportunity to view spectacular comets with relatively small aperture instruments in the 8&#160;cm to 15&#160;cm range is more frequent than might be guessed from the relatively rare attention they get in the mainstream press. </p>
<a id="Currently_visible_comets" name="Currently_visible_comets"></a><h3>Currently visible comets</h3>
<p><b>Comet <a href="/wiki/8P/Tuttle" id="w">8P/Tuttle</a></b>, discovered 1858 by <a href="/wiki/Horace_Parnell_Tuttle" id="w">Horace Parnell Tuttle</a>, currently at about magnitude +6, is visible in telescopes to Northern Hemisphere observers in the constellation <a href="/wiki/Triangulum" id="w">Triangulum</a>. It was next to spiral galaxy M33 on 30 DEC 2007. Perigee will occur at Jan 2-3 2008 at a distance of 0.25 AU. It is expected to rapidly move south through the month of January 2008, becoming favorable to Southern hemisphere observers by the end of the month.</p>
<p><b>Comet <a href="/wiki/17P/Holmes" id="w">17P/Holmes</a></b>, discovered 1892 by Edwin Holmes, is in major outburst, and is visible to the naked eye <sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It is currently about magnitude +4 in the constellation <a href="/wiki/Perseus_(constellation)" id="w">Perseus</a>. As of 30 DEC 2007 the coma exceeded two degrees in diameter as seen from Earth, and its apparent surface brightness diminishes as it continues to expand.</p>
