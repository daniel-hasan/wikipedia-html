<p>For the season <a href="/wiki/1989" id="w">1989</a>-<a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a>, Denizli signed a contract with the German second league side <a href="/wiki/Alemannia_Aachen" id="w">Alemannia Aachen</a>. Denizli had installed a new type of attacking football for the German club but he left from this club due to <a href="/wiki/Alemannia_Aachen" id="w">Alemannia Aachen</a> was faced with relegation to third league. Returned back to Turkey after one season, he was responsible for Galatasaray again. The team won <a href="/wiki/Turkish_Football_Cup" id="w">Turkish Cup</a> under his management in <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a>-<a href="/wiki/1992" id="w">1992</a> and played in the quarter finals of the <a href="/wiki/Cup_Winners_Cup" id="w">Cup Winners Cup</a>.

Denizli is the first Turkish coach of Fenerbahçe ever to win the league championship, but he enjoyed a rather poor <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League" id="w">Champions League</a> run with defeats against <a href="/wiki/FC_Barcelona" id="w">FC Barcelona</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bayer_Leverkusen" id="w">Bayer Leverkusen</a>.

He then transferred to Vestel Manisaspor. </p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, Denizli received several offers from <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> and <a href="/wiki/South-Korea" id="w">South-Korea</a>, but he chose to use his knowledge for <a href="/wiki/Iran" id="w">Iran</a> to coach the <a href="/wiki/Iran%26%2339%3Bs_Premier_Football_League" id="w">premier league</a> champion <a href="/wiki/Pas_Tehran" id="w">Pas Tehran</a>. Denizli made a run for the league title but became only second in the league. There were rumours that Denizli would be the coach of the <a href="/wiki/Iran_national_football_team" id="w">Iran national football team</a> to lead it to a successful <a href="/wiki/2006_Fifa_World_Cup" id="w">2006 World Cup</a>.

It was said that Mustafa Denizli would take over the Iranian national team after <a href="/wiki/Branko_Ivankovic" id="w">Branko Ivankovic</a> failed to make an impression on the world stage, but the <a href="/wiki/Iran" id="w">Iranian</a> <a href="/wiki/Amir_Ghalenoei" id="w">Amir Ghalenoei</a> was chosen over him. In August 2006, Denizli was hired as the manager of the Iranian club, <a href="/wiki/Persepolis_F.C." id="w">Persepolis F.C.</a>, after <a href="/wiki/Arie_Haan" id="w">Arie Haan</a> was fired. He resigned on <a href="/wiki/June_3" id="w">June 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> after an unsuccesful season with <a href="/wiki/Persepolis_F.C." id="w">Persepolis</a> in which he failed in the <a href="/wiki/Hazfi_Cup" id="w">Hazfi Cup</a> with an embarrassing 4-1 defeat to <a href="/wiki/Sepahan_F.C." id="w">Sepahan</a> and more importantly the <a href="/wiki/Iran%26%2339%3Bs_Premier_Football_League" id="w">IPL</a> in which his immensely talented team only managed a 3rd place finish.</p>
