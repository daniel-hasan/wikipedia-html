On <a href="/wiki/9_February" id="w">9 February</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a> the <a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> assaulted the north-western front of the <a href="/wiki/British_empire" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Colony" id="w">colony</a> of <a href="/wiki/Singapore" id="w">Singapore</a>. Their primary objective was to secure a second <a href="/wiki/Beachhead" id="w">beachhead</a> after their successful <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Sarimbun_Beach" id="w">assault at Sarimbun Beach</a> on <a href="/wiki/February_8" id="w">February 8</a>, in order to breach the Jurong-Kranji defence line as part of their southward thrust towards the heart of <a href="/wiki/Downtown_Core" id="w">Singapore City</a>. Defending the <a href="/wiki/Shoreline" id="w">shoreline</a> between the Kranji River and the <a href="/wiki/Johor-Singapore_Causeway" id="w">Johor-Singapore Causeway</a> was the <a href="/wiki/8th_Division_(Australia)" id="w">Australian 27th Brigade</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/Brigadier" id="w">Brigadier</a> <a href="/wiki/Duncan_Maxwell" id="w">Duncan Maxwell</a>, and one irregular <a href="/wiki/Company_(military_unit)" id="w">company</a>. On <a href="/wiki/10_February" id="w">10 February</a> the Japanese forces suffered their heaviest losses while moving up the Kranji River, which caused them to panic and nearly aborted the operation. However, a series of miscommunications and withdrawals by <a href="/wiki/Allied" id="w">Allied</a> forces in the ensuing battles allowed the Japanese to swiftly gain strategic footholds, which eventually led to the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore#The fall of Singapore" id="w">fall of Singapore</a> on <a href="/wiki/15_February" id="w">15 February</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>.<sup id="_ref-Owen_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Owen" title="">[1]</a></sup></p> 
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h1>Background</h1>
<p>The terrain around Kranji was primarily <a href="/wiki/Mangrove" id="w">mangrove</a> swamps and <a href="/wiki/Tropical_forest" id="w">tropical forest</a> intersected by streams and inlets. The <a href="/wiki/Shoreline" id="w">shoreline</a> between the Kranji River and the <a href="/wiki/Johor-Singapore_Causeway" id="w">Johor-Singapore Causeway</a>, nearly four <a href="/wiki/Kilometer" id="w">kilometers</a> long, was defended by the <a href="/wiki/8th_Division_(Australia)" id="w">Australian 27th Brigade</a>, led by Australian <a href="/wiki/Brigadier" id="w">Brigadier</a> Duncan Maxwell. The 27th Infantry Brigade consisted of three <a href="/wiki/Battalion" id="w">battalions</a>&#8212;the 2/30th, 2/29th, and 2/26th and was supported by the 2/10th Field Artillery Regiment, as well as one <a href="/wiki/Platoon" id="w">platoon</a> from the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>They were supported by one <a href="/wiki/Company_(military_unit)" id="w">company</a> from <a href="/wiki/Dalforce" id="w">Dalforce</a> (named after its commander, <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-Colonel" id="w">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> John Dalley of the <a href="/wiki/Malaysian_Special_Branch" id="w">Malayan Police Special Branch</a>),<sup id="_ref-NHB-Kranji_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHB-Kranji" title="">[3]</a></sup> a local <a href="/wiki/Chinese_in_Singapore" id="w">Chinese</a> <a href="/wiki/Militia" id="w">militia</a> consisting of <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China" id="w">Communists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kuomintang" id="w">Kuomintang</a> supporters, and other volunteers. As the war intensified, the Dalforce volunteers were given only three to four days of training and sent to the war front with elementary weapons.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Lacking uniforms, the volunteers improvised by wearing a red triangle on their blue shirts to avoid being mistaken for Japanese by the Australians.<sup id="_ref-NHB-Kranji_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHB-Kranji" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Allied forces at Kranji were to be assaulted by the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Guard_of_Japan" id="w">Imperial Guards Division</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Major_General" id="w">Major General</a> <a href="/wiki/Takuma_Nishimura" id="w">Takuma Nishimura</a>. 400 Imperial Guards had landed and taken <a href="/wiki/Pulau_Ubin" id="w">Pulau Ubin</a>, an island in the north-east of Singapore, in a <a href="/wiki/Feint" id="w">feint</a> attack on <a href="/wiki/February_7" id="w">February 7</a>, where they encountered minimal resistance.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_9" id="w">February 9</a>, two divisions of the <a href="/wiki/Twenty-Fifth_Army_(Japan)" id="w">Japanese Twenty Fifth Army</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_General" id="w">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="/wiki/Yamashita_Tomoyuki" id="w">Yamashita Tomoyuki</a>, landed on the northwestern coast of Singapore, in the <a href="/wiki/Sarimbun" id="w">Sarimbun</a> area. Yamashita&#39;s headquarters (HQ) was in the <a href="/wiki/Sultan_of_Johore" id="w">Sultan of Johore</a>&#39;s palace on <a href="/wiki/Istana_Bukit_Serene" id="w">Bukit Serene</a> which offered him and his officers a bird&#39;s eye view of virtually every key target in the northern sector of Singapore Island, only 1.6 kilometres (one mile) across the <a href="/wiki/Straits_of_Johor" id="w">Straits of Johor</a>. <a href="/wiki/Sultan_Ibrahim" id="w">Sultan Ibrahim</a>&#39;s palace was not fired upon by the British because any damage caused would have extensive repercussions for British-Johore ties.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>    </p>
<p>The primary objective of the Japanese at Kranji was to capture Kranji village; this would let them repair the demolished Causeway in order to facilitate easy flow of reinforcements and supplies down the roads of <a href="/wiki/Woodlands%2C_Singapore" id="w">Woodlands</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mandai_Road" id="w">Mandai</a>, and to the rest of the island for their <a href="/wiki/Tactical_formation" id="w">vanguard</a> force.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Once the leading wave of Japanese was safely ashore, the massed Japanese artillery switched their fire to the defensive positions at Kranji. Telegraph and telephone communications were destroyed in the bombardment and communications between the <a href="/wiki/Front_line" id="w">front line</a> and command HQ were broken. At 8:30pm that night, the men of the Imperial Guards Division began the crossing from Johore in special armoured landing-crafts, collapsible boats and by swimming.<sup id="_ref-Owen_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Owen" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="10_February_1942:_Heavy_losses" name="10_February_1942:_Heavy_losses"></a><h2>10 February 1942: Heavy losses</h2>
<p>In the early hours of <a href="/wiki/February_10" id="w">February 10</a>, Japanese forces suffered their heaviest losses during the Battle of Singapore. While moving up the Kranji River, advance landing parties from the 4th Regiment of the Imperial Guard Division found themselves under heavy fire from Australian machine gunners and <a href="/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)" id="w">mortar</a> teams. They also found themselves surrounded by oil slicks, which had been created by Allied personnel emptying the nearby Woodlands oil depot, to prevent its capture. A scenario feared by Yamashita came to pass by accident; the oil was set alight by Allied small arms fire,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> causing many Japanese soldiers to be burnt alive. Sustaining heavy losses, Nishimura requested permission to abandon the operation. However, Yamashita denied the request.<sup id="_ref-Yap_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yap" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Maxwell, who had limited communications with his division headquarters, was concerned that his force would be cut off by fierce and chaotic fighting at Sarimbun and Jurong to the south west, involving the Australian 22nd Brigade. Maxwell&#39;s force consequently withdrew from the seafront. This allowed the Japanese to land in increasing strength and take control of Kranji village. They also captured Woodlands, and began repairing the Causeway, without encountering any Allied attacks.<sup id="_ref-NHB-Kranji_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHB-Kranji" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Development_of_Japanese_tanks_in_World_War_II" id="w">Japanese light tanks</a>, which had good buoyancy, were towed across the straits to Lim Chu Kang Road where they joined the battle at dusk.<sup id="_ref-Bose_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bose" title="">[10]</a></sup> With reinforced troops and tanks advancing down Choa Chua Kang Road, the Australian troops were no match for the tanks and fled to the hills of <a href="/wiki/Bukit_Panjang" id="w">Bukit Panjang</a>. The Japanese 5th Division captured <a href="/wiki/Bukit_Timah" id="w">Bukit Timah</a> village by the evening of <a href="/wiki/February_11" id="w">February 11</a>.<sup id="_ref-Yap_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yap" title="">[9]</a></sup>  </p>

</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-General" id="w">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Ernest_Percival" id="w">Arthur Ernest Percival</a>, General Officer Commanding of HQ Malaya Command, drew a defence perimeter covering <a href="/wiki/Kallang" id="w">Kallang</a> <a href="/wiki/Aerodrome" id="w">aerodrome</a>, <a href="/wiki/MacRitchie_Reservoir" id="w">MacRitchie</a> and <a href="/wiki/Upper_Peirce_Reservoir" id="w">Peirce reservoirs</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Bukit_Timah" id="w">Bukit Timah</a> supply depot area to ensure the integrity of the city&#39;s defence. One line of the north-western defence perimeter was the Jurong-Kranji defence line, a narrow ridge connecting the sources of the Jurong and the Kranji Rivers, forming a natural defence line protecting the north-west approach to the Singapore City. (Its counterpart was the Serangoon Line, which was sited between <a href="/wiki/Kallang_Airport" id="w">Kallang Airport</a> and Paya Lebar village on the eastern part of Singapore).<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The troops were to defend this Line strongly against the invading Japanese force. The Line was defended by the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade which covered milestone 12 on Jurong Road, the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade and the reinforced 22nd Australian Brigade which guarded the northern part of the Line and maintained contact with the 44th Indian Brigade.<sup id="_ref-NHB-Defence Line_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHB-Defence Line" title="">[12]</a></sup> The 15th Indian Infantry Brigade was re-positioned near <a href="/wiki/Bukit_Timah_Road" id="w">Bukit Timah Road</a> to guard the island&#39;s vital food and petrol supplies. A secret instruction to protect this area was issued to Percival&#39;s generals.<sup id="_ref-NHB-Defence Line_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHB-Defence Line" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Miscommunication" name="Miscommunication"></a><h4>Miscommunication</h4>
<p>Percival&#39;s secret orders to withdraw to the last defence line around the city only if necessary were misunderstood by Maxwell, who took this to be an order for an immediate withdrawal to the Line.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> As a result, the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade, the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade and the 22nd Australian Brigade, reinforced after their withdrawal from Sarimbun beach in the north-west, abandoned the Line on <a href="/wiki/10_February" id="w">10 February</a>. Fearing that the large supplies depot would fall into Japanese hands should they make a rush for Bukit Timah too soon, General Sir <a href="/wiki/Archibald_Wavell%2C_1st_Earl_Wavell" id="w">Archibald Wavell</a>, Allied Commander-in-Chief of the Far East sent an urgent message to Percival:</p>

</p>
<p>By <a href="/wiki/11_February" id="w">11 February</a>, the Jurong-Kranji defence line was left undefended which allowed the Japanese forces to sweep through the Line to attack Bukit Timah.<sup id="_ref-NHB-Defence Line_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHB-Defence Line" title="">[12]</a></sup> On the same day, Percival finally moved his Combined Operations Headquarters in Sime Road to the underground <a href="/wiki/Bunker" id="w">bunker</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Battle_Box" id="w">The Battle Box</a></i> at <a href="/wiki/Fort_Canning" id="w">Fort Canning</a>.<sup id="_ref-Bose_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bose" title="">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Despite their fighting spirit, the Dalforce fighters suffered from poor training and the lack of equipment. A further blow was delivered when the 27th Australian Brigade withdrew southwards. As a result, the Japanese established a stronghold in the northern Woodlands area and secured a relatively easy passage into the island.<sup id="_ref-NHB-Kranji_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHB-Kranji" title="">[3]</a></sup> General Wavell left Singapore for <a href="/wiki/Java" id="w">Java</a> early on <a href="/wiki/February_11" id="w">February 11</a> and sent a cable to <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchhill" id="w">Winston Churchhill</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> on his assessment of the war front in Singapore:</p>
