The <b>TGV</b> (<b><i>t</i></b><i>rain à <b>g</b>rande <b>v</b>itesse</i>, <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a> for &#34;high-speed train&#34;) is <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/High-speed_rail" id="w">high-speed rail</a> service developed by GEC-Alsthom (now <a href="/wiki/Alstom" id="w">Alstom</a>) and <a href="/wiki/SNCF" id="w">SNCF</a>, the French national <a href="/wiki/Rail_transport_operations" id="w">rail operator</a>, and operated primarily by SNCF. Following the inaugural TGV service between <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lyon" id="w">Lyon</a> in 1981, the TGV network, centred on Paris, has expanded to connect cities across France and in adjacent countries. It holds the <a href="/wiki/Land_speed_record_for_railed_vehicles" id="w">record</a> for the fastest wheeled train, having reached 574.8&#160;<a href="/wiki/Kilometres_per_hour" id="w">km/h</a> (357&#160;<a href="/wiki/Miles_per_hour" id="w">mph</a>) on <a href="/wiki/3_April" id="w">3 April</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> and also holds the world&#39;s highest average speed for a regular passenger service. TGV is a registered trademark of <a href="/wiki/SNCF" id="w">SNCF</a>.</p>
<p>The success of the first line led to an expansion of the network, with new lines built in the south, west, north and east of the country. Eager to emulate the success of the French network, neighbouring countries such as <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> built their own high-speed lines. TGVs link with <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a> through the French network, with <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a> through the <a href="/wiki/Thalys" id="w">Thalys</a> network, and the <a href="/wiki/Eurostar" id="w">Eurostar</a> network links France and Belgium with the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>. Several lines are planned, including extensions within France and to surrounding countries. Towns such as <a href="/wiki/Tours" id="w">Tours</a> have become a part of a &#34;TGV <a href="/wiki/Commuting" id="w">commuter</a> belt&#34;.</p>
<p>TGV trainsets travel at up to 320&#160;<a href="/wiki/Kilometre_per_hour" id="w">km/h</a> (200&#160;<a href="/wiki/Miles_per_hour" id="w">mph</a>) in commercial use. A specially modified trainset <a href="/wiki/TGV_world_speed_record#Record of 2007" id="w">reached 574.8&#160;km/h</a> (357 mph) on test runs. Its high speed, almost equal to that of prototype <a href="/wiki/Maglev_train" id="w">maglev trains</a>, is made possible through the use of specially-designed <a href="/wiki/LGV_construction" id="w">LGVs</a> (<i>lignes à grande vitesse</i>, high-speed lines) without sharp curves and with high-powered <a href="/wiki/Electric_motor" id="w">electric motors</a>, low axle weight, <a href="/wiki/Articulated_car" id="w">articulated carriages</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cab_signalling" id="w">in-cab signalling</a> (eliminating the need for drivers to view lineside <a href="/wiki/Railway_signal" id="w">signals</a> at high speed).</p>
<p>TGV trainsets are manufactured primarily by <a href="/wiki/Alstom" id="w">Alstom</a>, now often with the involvement of a subcontractor, such as <a href="/wiki/Bombardier" id="w">Bombardier</a>. Except for a small series of TGVs used for <a href="/wiki/Mail" id="w">postal</a> freight between Paris, Lyon and Provence, the TGV is primarily a passenger service. Trains derived from TGV designs operate in <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" id="w">South Korea</a> (<a href="/wiki/Korea_Train_Express" id="w">KTX</a>), <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a> (<a href="/wiki/AVE" id="w">AVE</a>) and <a href="/wiki/USA" id="w">USA</a> (<a href="/wiki/ACELA_Express" id="w">ACELA Express</a>).</p>
<p>Travel by TGV has largely replaced air travel between connected cities, due to shorter travel times (especially for trips taking less than three hours), reduced <a href="/wiki/Check-in" id="w">check-in</a>, security and boarding formalities, and the convenient location of <a href="/wiki/Train_station" id="w">stations</a> in the hearts of cities. The TGV is a very safe <a href="/wiki/Mode_of_transport" id="w">mode of transport</a>; whilst there have been <a href="/wiki/TGV_accidents" id="w">accidents</a>, there has never been a fatality while travelling at high speed.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<p>{{main}}
The idea of the TGV was first proposed in the 1960s, after Japan had begun construction of the <a href="/wiki/Shinkansen" id="w">Shinkansen</a> in 1959. At the time the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_France" id="w">French government</a> favoured new technologies, exploring the production of <a href="/wiki/Hovercraft" id="w">hovercraft</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maglev_train" id="w">maglev</a> trains such as <a href="/wiki/A%C3%A9rotrain" id="w">Aérotrain</a>. Simultaneously, SNCF began researching high speed trains that would operate on conventional track.</p>
<p>It was originally planned that the TGV, then standing for <i>très grande vitesse</i> (very high speed) or <i>turbine grande vitesse</i> (high speed turbine), would be propelled by <a href="/wiki/Gas_turbine-electric_locomotive" id="w">gas turbine-electric locomotives</a>. <a href="/wiki/Gas_turbine" id="w">Gas turbines</a> were selected for their small size, good <a href="/wiki/Power-to-weight_ratio" id="w">power-to-weight ratio</a>, and ability to deliver high power over an extended period. The first prototype, <a href="/wiki/TGV_001" id="w">TGV 001</a>, was the only TGV constructed with this engine - following the increase in the price of <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" id="w">oil</a> during the <a href="/wiki/1973_oil_crisis" id="w">1973 energy crisis</a>, gas turbines were deemed impractical and the project turned to <a href="/wiki/Electricity" id="w">electricity</a> from <a href="/wiki/Overhead_lines" id="w">overhead lines</a>. The electricity was to be generated by France&#39;s new <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant" id="w">nuclear power stations</a>.</p>
<p>TGV 001 was not a wasted prototype. Its gas-turbine powerplant was only one of many technologies for high-speed rail travel. It also tested high speed brakes, needed to dissipate the large amount of <a href="/wiki/Kinetic_energy" id="w">kinetic energy</a> of a train at high speed, high speed aerodynamics, and signalling. It was articulated, meaning that two adjacent carriages shared a <a href="/wiki/Bogie" id="w">bogie</a> between them, allowing free yet controlled motion with respect to one another. It reached 318&#160;km/h (198&#160;mph), which remains the world speed record for a non-electric train. Its interior and exterior were styled by French-born designer Jacques Cooper, whose work formed the basis of early TGV designs, including the distinctive nose shape of the first TGV power cars.</p>
<p>Changing the TGV to electric traction required a significant design overhaul. The first electric prototype, nicknamed <a href="/wiki/Z%C3%A9bulon" id="w">Zébulon</a>, was completed in 1974, testing features such as innovative body mounting of motors, <a href="/wiki/Pantograph_(rail)" id="w">pantographs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Suspension_(vehicle)" id="w">suspension</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brake" id="w">braking</a>. Body mounting of motors allowed over 3&#160;tonnes (2.95&#160;<a href="/wiki/Long_ton" id="w">long tons</a>) to be eliminated from the power cars. The prototype travelled almost 1,000,000&#160;km (621,000&#160;miles) during testing.</p>
<p>In 1976 the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_France" id="w">French government</a> funded the TGV project, and construction of the <a href="/wiki/LGV_Sud-Est" id="w">LGV Sud-Est</a>, the first high-speed line (<b><i>l</i></b><i>igne à <b>g</b>rande <b>v</b>itesse</i>), began shortly afterwards. The line was given the designation LN1, <i>Ligne Nouvelle 1</i> (New Line 1).</p>

After two pre-production trainsets (nicknamed <i>Patrick</i> and <i>Sophie</i>) had been tested and substantially modified, the first production version was delivered on <a href="/wiki/25_April" id="w">25 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1980" id="w">1980</a>. The TGV service opened to the public between <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lyon" id="w">Lyon</a> on <a href="/wiki/27_September" id="w">27 September</a>, <a href="/wiki/1981" id="w">1981</a>. The initial target customers were businesspeople travelling between those two cities. The TGV was considerably faster than normal trains, <a href="/wiki/Automobile" id="w">cars</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft" id="w">airplanes</a>. The trains became popular outside their target market, the public welcoming fast and practical travel between cities.</p>
<p>Since then, further LGVs have opened in France, including the <a href="/wiki/LGV_Atlantique" id="w">LGV Atlantique</a> (LN2) to <a href="/wiki/Tours" id="w">Tours</a>/<a href="/wiki/Le_Mans" id="w">Le Mans</a> (construction begun 1985, in operation 1989); the <a href="/wiki/LGV_Nord" id="w">LGV Nord-Europe</a> (LN3) to <a href="/wiki/Calais" id="w">Calais</a> and the Belgian border (construction begun 1989, in operation 1993); the <a href="/wiki/LGV_Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes" id="w">LGV Rhône-Alpes</a> (LN4), extending the LGV Sud-Est to <a href="/wiki/Valence%2C_Dr%C3%B4me" id="w">Valence</a> (construction begun 1990, in operation 1992); and the <a href="/wiki/LGV_M%C3%A9diterran%C3%A9e" id="w">LGV Méditerranée</a> (LN5) to <a href="/wiki/Marseille" id="w">Marseille</a> (construction begun 1996, in operation 2001). The <a href="/wiki/LGV_Est" id="w">LGV Est</a> from Paris to <a href="/wiki/Strasbourg" id="w">Strasbourg</a> was inaugurated on <a href="/wiki/15_March" id="w">15 March</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, and opened to the public in the summer of 2007. In its first month of operation, more than 1.000.000 passengers traveled on the line. High speed lines based on LGV technology connecting with the French network have been built in <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Eurostar" id="w">Eurostar</a> service began operation in 1994, connecting <a href="/wiki/Continental_Europe" id="w">continental Europe</a> to London via the <a href="/wiki/Channel_Tunnel" id="w">Channel Tunnel</a> with a version of the TGV designed for use in the tunnel and in the United Kingdom. The line used the LGV Nord-Europe in France from the outset. The first phase of the British <a href="/wiki/High_Speed_1" id="w">High Speed 1</a> line, or Channel Tunnel Rail Link, was completed in 2003, and the second phase was completed on Wednesday <a href="/wiki/14_November" id="w">14 November</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>. The fastest trains take 2 hours 15 minutes on the London-Paris and 1 hour 51 minutes on the London-Brussels route.</p>
<p>The TGV was the world&#39;s second commercial high speed service, after Japan&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Shinkansen" id="w">Shinkansen</a>, which first connected <a href="/wiki/Tokyo" id="w">Tokyo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Osaka" id="w">Osaka</a> on <a href="/wiki/1_October" id="w">1 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1964" id="w">1964</a>. The TGV currently holds the <a href="/wiki/Land_speed_record_for_railed_vehicles" id="w">world speed record</a> for conventional, wheel/rail trains. On <a href="/wiki/3_April" id="w">3 April</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> a modified <a href="/wiki/SNCF_TGV_POS" id="w">TGV POS</a> train reached 574.8&#160;km/h (357.2&#160;mph) <a href="/wiki/TGV_world_speed_record" id="w">under test conditions</a> on the <a href="/wiki/LGV_Est" id="w">LGV Est</a>.  The voltage on the test track between Paris and Strasbourg was boosted to 31,000 volts and extra ballast was tamped onto the right-of-way.   By doing so, it beat the 1990 <a href="/wiki/Land_speed_record_for_railed_vehicles" id="w">world speed record</a> of 515.3&#160;km/h (320.2&#160;mph), set by a similarly shortened train (two power cars and three passenger cars), along with unofficial records set during weeks preceding the official record run. The test was part of an extensive research programme by Alstom.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The TGV is in 2007 the <a href="/wiki/Land_speed_record_for_railed_vehicles" id="w">world&#39;s fastest conventional scheduled train</a>: one journey&#39;s average start-to-stop speed from Lorraine-TGV to Champagne-Ardenne-TGV is 279.3&#160;km/h (173.6&#160;mph).<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/British_Rail_Class_373" id="w">Eurostar train</a> broke the record for the <i>longest</i> non-stop high speed journey in the world on <a href="/wiki/17_May" id="w">17 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> carrying the cast and filmmakers of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code_(film)" id="w">The Da Vinci Code</a></i> from <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> to <a href="/wiki/Cannes" id="w">Cannes</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival" id="w">Cannes Film Festival</a>. The 1421&#160;km (883.0&#160;miles) journey took 7 hours 25 minutes (191.6&#160;km/h or 119&#160;mph).<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The record for the <i>fastest</i> long distance run was set by a <a href="/wiki/SNCF_TGV_R%C3%A9seau" id="w">TGV Réseau</a> train travelling from <a href="/wiki/Calais" id="w">Calais</a>-Frethun to <a href="/wiki/Marseille" id="w">Marseille</a> (1067.2&#160;km, 663&#160;mi) in 3 hours 29 minutes (306&#160;km/h or 190&#160;mph) for the inauguration of the <a href="/wiki/LGV_M%C3%A9diterran%C3%A9e" id="w">LGV Méditerranée</a> on <a href="/wiki/26_May" id="w">26 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/28_November" id="w">28 November</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a> the TGV carried its one-billionth passenger, second only to the Shinkansen&#39;s five billionth passenger in 2000. The two-billion mark is expected to be reached in 2010.</p>
<a id="Tracks" name="Tracks"></a><h1>Tracks</h1>

The newest high-speed lines allow speeds of up to 320&#160;<a href="/wiki/Kilometre_per_hour" id="w">km/h</a> (200&#160;<a href="/wiki/Miles_per_hour" id="w">mph</a>) in normal operation. Originally, LGVs were defined as lines permitting speeds greater than 200&#160;km/h (125&#160;mph); this guideline was subsequently revised to 250&#160;km/h (155&#160;mph). TGVs also run on conventional track (<i>lignes classiques</i>), at the normal maximum safe speed for those lines, up to a maximum of 220&#160;km/h (137&#160;mph). This is an advantage that the TGV has over, for example, <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_levitation_train" id="w">magnetic levitation trains</a>, as TGVs can serve many more destinations and can use city-centre stations (as in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lyon" id="w">Lyon</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dijon" id="w">Dijon</a>). They now serve around 200 destinations in France and abroad.</p>
<a id="Track_design" name="Track_design"></a><h2>Track design</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/LGV_construction" id="w">LGV construction</a> is similar to that of normal railway lines, but with a few key differences. The <a href="/wiki/Radius" id="w">radii</a> of curves are larger so that trains can traverse them at higher speeds without increasing the <a href="/wiki/Centrifugal_force" id="w">centrifugal force</a> felt by passengers. The radii of LGV curves have historically been greater than 4&#160;<a href="/wiki/Kilometre" id="w">km</a> (2.5&#160;<a href="/wiki/Mile" id="w">miles</a>). New lines have minimum radii of 7&#160;km (4&#160;miles) to allow for future increases in speed.</p>
<p>Lines used only for high-speed traffic can incorporate steeper <a href="/wiki/Grade_(slope)" id="w">grades</a> than normal. This facilitates the planning of LGVs and reduces the cost of line construction. The considerable momentum of TGVs at high speed allows them to climb steep slopes without greatly increasing their energy consumption. They can also coast on downward slopes, further increasing efficiency. The Paris-Sud-Est LGV features line grades of up to 3.5%. (On the German NBS high-speed line between <a href="/wiki/Cologne" id="w">Cologne</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt" id="w">Frankfurt</a> they reach 4%.)</p>
<p>Track alignment is more precise than on normal railway lines, and <a href="/wiki/Track_ballast" id="w">ballast</a> is in a deeper than normal <a href="/wiki/Profile_(engineering)" id="w">profile</a>, resulting in increased load-bearing capacity and track stability. LGV track is anchored by more <a href="/wiki/Railroad_tie" id="w">sleepers</a> (railroad ties) per kilometre than usual, and all are made of concrete, either mono- or bi-bloc, the latter consisting of two separate blocks of concrete joined by a steel bar. Heavy rail (<a href="/wiki/International_Union_of_Railways" id="w">UIC</a> 60) is used and the rails themselves are more upright, with an inclination of 1 in 40 as opposed to 1 in 20 on normal lines. Use of continuous welded rails in place of shorter, jointed rails yields a comfortable ride at high speed, without the &#34;clickety-clack&#34; vibrations induced by rail joints.</p>
<p>The diameter of tunnels is greater than normally required by the size of the trains, especially at entrances. This limits the effects of air pressure changes, which could be problematic at TGV speeds.</p>
<a id="Traffic_limitations" name="Traffic_limitations"></a><h2>Traffic limitations</h2>
<p>LGVs are reserved primarily for TGVs. One reason for this limitation is that capacity is sharply reduced when trains of differing speeds are mixed. Passing freight and passenger trains also constitute a safety risk, as cargo on freight cars can be destabilised by the air turbulence caused by the TGV.</p> 
<p>The steep gradients common on LGVs would limit the weight of slow freight trains. Slower trains would also mean that the maximum track cant (banking on curves) would be limited, so for the same maximum speed a mixed-traffic LGV would need to be built with curves of even larger radius. Such track would be much more expensive to build and maintain. Some stretches of less-used LGV are routinely mixed-traffic, such as the <a href="/wiki/Tours" id="w">Tours</a> branch of the LGV Atlantique, and the planned <a href="/wiki/N%C3%AEmes" id="w">Nîmes</a>/<a href="/wiki/Montpellier" id="w">Montpellier</a> branch of the LGV Mediterranée. The British <a href="/wiki/High_Speed_1" id="w">High Speed 1</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Channel_Tunnel" id="w">Channel Tunnel</a> to London has been built with passing loops to support freight use, but this facility has not been used.</p>
<p>Maintenance on LGVs is carried out at night, when no TGVs are running.</p>
<p>Outside France, LGVs often carry non-TGV intercity traffic, often as a requirement of the initial funding commitments.{{Fact}}  The Belgian LGV from Brussels to Liège carries 200 km/h loco-hauled trains, with both the Dutch <a href="/wiki/HSL_Zuid" id="w">HSL Zuid</a> and British <a href="/wiki/High_Speed_1" id="w">High Speed 1</a> planned to carry 200 km/h domestic intercity services. The <a href="/wiki/Channel_Tunnel" id="w">Channel Tunnel</a> is not an LGV, but it uses LGV-type TVM signalling for mixed freight, shuttle and Eurostar traffic at between 100 km/h and 160 km/h. The &#34;Standard Pathway&#34; for path allocation purposes is the time taken by one of Eurotunnel&#39;s own Shuttle trains (maximum speed 140 km/h) to traverse the Tunnel. A single Eurostar running at 160 km/h occupies 2.67 standard paths; a second Eurostar running at minimum distance (3 minutes) behind the first train only &#34;costs&#34; an additional 1 path, which is why the Eurostar services are often flighted 3 minutes apart throughout from London to Lille and vice versa. A freight train running at 120 km/h occupies 1.33 paths. A freight running at 100 km/h occupies 3 paths. This illustrates the problem of mixed traffic at different speeds.{{Fact}}</p>

<a id="Power_supply" name="Power_supply"></a><h2>Power supply</h2>
<p>LGVs are all <a href="/wiki/Railway_electrification_system" id="w">electrified</a> at <a href="/wiki/25_kV_AC" id="w">25 kV 50&#160;Hz AC</a>. <a href="/wiki/Overhead_lines" id="w">Catenary</a> wires are kept at a greater mechanical tension than normal lines because the <a href="/wiki/Pantograph_(rail)" id="w">pantograph</a> causes <a href="/wiki/Oscillation" id="w">oscillations</a> in the wire, and the <a href="/wiki/Wave" id="w">wave</a> must travel faster than the train to avoid producing <a href="/wiki/Standing_wave" id="w">standing waves</a> that would cause the wires to break. This was a problem when rail speed record attempts were made in 1990; power wire tension had to be increased further still to accommodate train speeds of over 500&#160;km/h (310&#160;mph). On LGVs, only the rear pantograph is raised, avoiding amplification of the oscillations created by the front pantograph. The front power car is supplied by a cable running along the roof of the train. Eurostar trains are long enough that oscillations are <a href="/wiki/Damping" id="w">damped</a> sufficiently between the front and rear power cars, so both pantographs can be raised - there is no interconnecting high-voltage cable along the 400 m length of the train. On <i>lignes classiques</i> slower maximum speeds prevent oscillation problems, and on DC lines both pantographs must be raised.</p>
<a id="Separation" name="Separation"></a><h2>Separation</h2>
<p>LGVs are fenced along their entire length to prevent trespassing by animals and people. <a href="/wiki/Level_crossing" id="w">Level crossings</a> are not permitted and bridges over the line have sensors to detect objects that fall onto the track.</p>
<p>All LGV junctions are <a href="/wiki/Grade_separation" id="w">grade-separated</a>, with tracks crossing each other using <a href="/wiki/Flying_junction" id="w">flyovers</a> or <a href="/wiki/Tunnel" id="w">tunnels</a>, eliminating crossing other tracks on the level.</p>
<a id="Signalling" name="Signalling"></a><h1>Signalling</h1>
<p>{{main}}
Because TGVs on LGVs travel too fast for their drivers to see and react to traditional lineside <a href="/wiki/Railway_signal" id="w">signals</a>, an automated system called TVM (<i>Transmission Voie-Machine</i>, or <i>track-to-train transmission</i>) is used for signalling. Information is transmitted to trains via electrical pulses sent through the rails, providing speed, target speed, and stop/go indications directly to the driver via dashboard-mounted instruments. This high degree of automation does not eliminate driver control, though there are safeguards that can safely stop the train in the event of driver error.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The boundaries of signalling block sections are marked by distinctive boards.</div>
The line is divided into signal blocks of about 1500&#160;<a href="/wiki/Metre" id="w">m</a> (1&#160;<a href="/wiki/Mile" id="w">mile</a>), with the boundaries marked by blue boards with a yellow triangle. Dashboard instruments show the maximum permitted speed for the train&#39;s current block and a target speed based on the profile of the line ahead. The maximum permitted speed is based on factors such as the proximity of trains ahead (with steadily decreasing speeds permitted in blocks closer to the rear of the next train), <a href="/wiki/Junction_(rail)" id="w">junction</a> placement, speed restrictions, the top speed of the train and distance from the end of the LGV. As trains cannot usually stop within one signal block, which can range in length from a few hundred metres to a few kilometres, drivers are alerted to slow gradually several blocks before a required stop.</p>
<p>Two versions of TVM signalling, TVM-430 and TVM-300, are in use on LGV. TVM-430, a newer system, was first installed on the LGV Nord to the <a href="/wiki/Channel_Tunnel" id="w">Channel Tunnel</a> and Belgium, and supplies trains with more information than TVM-300. Among other benefits, TVM-430 allows a train&#39;s on-board computer system to generate a continuous speed control curve in the event of an emergency brake activation, effectively forcing the driver to reduce speed safely without releasing the brake.{{clarifyme}}</p>
<p>The signalling system is normally permissive: the driver of a train is permitted to proceed into an occupied block section without first obtaining authorization. Speed is limited to 30&#160;km/h (19&#160;mph) and if speed exceeds 35&#160;km/h (22&#160;mph) the emergency brake is applied. If the board marking the entrance to the block section is accompanied by a sign marked Nf, for <i>non-franchissable</i>, the block section is not permissive, and the driver must obtain authorisation from the <i>Poste d&#39;Aiguillage et de Régulation</i> (PAR - Signalling and Control Centre) before entering. Once a route is set or the PAR has provided authorization, a white lamp above the board is lit to inform the driver. The driver acknowledges the authorization using a button on the control panel. This disables the emergency braking, which would otherwise occur when passing over the ground loop adjacent to the non-permissive board.</p>
<p>When trains enter or leave LGVs from <i>lignes classiques</i>, they pass over a ground loop that automatically switches the driver&#39;s dashboard indicators to the appropriate signalling system. For example, a train leaving the LGV for a <i>ligne classique</i> has its TVM system deactivated and its traditional KVB (<i>Contrôle Vitesse par Balise</i>, or <i>beacon speed control</i>) system enabled.</p>

<p>One of the main advantages of TGV over other fast rail technologies such as <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_levitation_train" id="w">magnetic levitation</a> is that TGVs can take advantage of existing infrastructure. This makes connecting city centres (such as Paris-<a href="/wiki/Gare_de_Lyon" id="w">Gare de Lyon</a> to <a href="/wiki/Gare_de_Lyon-Perrache" id="w">Lyon-Perrache</a>) by TGV a simple and inexpensive proposition. TGVs often use intra-city tracks and stations built for lower speed trains.</p>
<p>However, LGV route designers have tended to build new intermediate stations in suburban areas or in the open countryside several kilometers away from cities. This allows TGVs to stop without incurring too great a time penalty, since more time is spent on high speed track; in addition, many cities&#39; stations are stub-ends, while LGV tracks frequently bypass cities. In some cases, stations have been built halfway between two communities. The station serving <a href="/wiki/Montceau-les-Mines" id="w">Montceau-les-Mines</a> and <a href="/wiki/Le_Creusot" id="w">Le Creusot</a> is an example, and a more controversial example is <a href="/wiki/Gare_TGV_Haute-Picardie" id="w">Haute Picardie</a> station, between <a href="/wiki/Amiens" id="w">Amiens</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saint-Quentin%2C_Aisne" id="w">Saint-Quentin</a>. The press and local authorities criticized Haute Picardie as being too far from either town to be convenient, and too far from connecting railway lines to be useful for travellers. The station was nicknamed <i>la gare des betteraves,</i> or &#39;beet station&#39;, as it was surrounded by <a href="/wiki/Sugar_beet" id="w">sugar beet</a> fields during construction.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> This nickname is now applied to similar stations away from town and city centres, whether in the vicinity of beet fields or not.</p>
<p>New railway stations have been built for TGV services, some of which are major architectural achievements in their own right. <a href="/wiki/Avignon" id="w">Avignon</a> TGV station, opened in 2001, has been praised as one of the most remarkable stations on the network, with a spectacular 340&#160;m (1,115&#160;ft)-long glazed roof that has been compared to that of a <a href="/wiki/Cathedral" id="w">cathedral</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>TGVs are semi-permanently coupled <a href="/wiki/Articulated_vehicle" id="w">articulated</a> <a href="/wiki/Multiple_unit" id="w">multiple units</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Jacobs_bogie" id="w">Jacobs bogies</a> between the carriages, supporting both of them. <a href="/wiki/Locomotive" id="w">Power cars</a> at each end of the trains have their own bogies. Trains can be lengthened by coupling two TGVs together, using couplers hidden in the noses of the power cars.</p>
<p>The articulated design is advantageous during a derailment, as the passenger carriages are more likely to stay upright and in line with the track. Normal trains, by contrast, may split at <a href="/wiki/Coupling_(railway)" id="w">couplings</a> and jack-knife.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of this carriage design is that it is difficult to split sets of carriages. While TGV power cars can be removed from trains via standard uncoupling procedures, specialized depot equipment is needed to split carriages, by lifting the entire train at once. Once uncoupled, one of the carriage ends is left without a bogie at the split, so a bogie frame is required to support it.</p>
<p>SNCF operates a fleet of about 400 TGVs. Seven types of TGV or TGV derivative currently operate on the French network; these are: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/TGV_Sud-Est" id="w">TGV Sud-Est</a> (passengers) and <i>La Poste</i> (freight), </li>
<li><a href="/wiki/TGV_Atlantique" id="w">TGV Atlantique</a> (10 rather than 8 carriages)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/TGV_R%C3%A9seau" id="w">TGV Réseau</a> (similar to Atlantique, but only 8 carriages)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Eurostar" id="w">Eurostar</a> (Three Capitals and North of London), </li>
<li><a href="/wiki/TGV_Duplex" id="w">TGV Duplex</a> (two floors for greater passenger capacity), </li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Thalys" id="w"> Thalys PBA and PBKA</a> (Benelux countries, derived from Réseau and Duplex respectively),</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/TGV_POS" id="w">TGV POS</a> (Paris-Ostfrankreich-Suddeutschland, or Paris-Eastern France-Southern Germany).</li></ul>
<p>All TGVs are at least <i>bi-current</i>, which means that they can operate at 25&#160;kV, 50&#160;Hz&#160;AC on newer lines (including LGVs) and at 1.5&#160;kV&#160;DC on older lines (such as the 1.5&#160;kV <i>lignes classiques</i> that are common around Paris). Trains crossing the border into <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> must accommodate other voltages, requiring <i>tri-current</i> and <i>quadri-current</i> TGVs. TGVs have two pairs of pantographs, two for AC use and two for DC use. When passing between areas of different supply voltage, marker boards remind the driver to turn off power to the <a href="/wiki/Traction_motor" id="w">traction motors</a>, lower the pantograph(s), adjust a switch to select the appropriate system, and raise the pantograph(s). Pantographs and pantograph height control are selected automatically based on the voltage system chosen by the driver. Once the train detects the correct supply, a dashboard indicator illuminates and the driver can switch on the traction motors. The train coasts across the boundary between sections.

The Sud-Est fleet was built between 1978 and 1988 and operated the first TGV service, from Paris to Lyon in 1981. There are 107 passenger sets operating, of which nine are tri-current (including 15&#160;kV, 16⅔&#160;Hz&#160;AC for use in Switzerland) and the rest bi-current. There are also seven bi-current half-sets without seats that carry mail for <a href="/wiki/La_Poste" id="w">La Poste</a> between Paris, Lyon and <a href="/wiki/Provence" id="w">Provence</a>, in a distinctive yellow livery.</p>
<p>Each set is made up of two power cars and eight carriages (capacity 345 seats), including a powered bogie in each of the carriages adjacent to the power cars. They are 200&#160;m (656&#160;ft) long and 2.81&#160;m (9.2&#160;ft) wide. They weigh 385&#160;tonnes with a power output of 6,450&#160;kW under 25&#160;kV.</p>
<p>Originally the sets were built to run at 270&#160;km/h (168&#160;mph) but most were upgraded to 300&#160;km/h (186&#160;mph) during mid-life refurbishment in preparation for the opening of the LGV Méditerranée. The few sets that still have a maximum speed of 270&#160;km/h operate on those routes that include a comparatively short distance on LGV, such as to Switzerland via Dijon. SNCF did not consider it financially worthwhile to upgrade their speed for a marginal reduction in journey time.</p>

The Atlantique fleet was built between 1988 and 1992. 105 bi-current sets were built for the opening of the LGV Atlantique and entry into service began in 1989. They are 237.5&#160;m (780&#160;ft) long and 2.9&#160;m (9.5&#160;ft) wide. They weigh 444 tonnes (489 short tons), and are made up of two power cars and ten carriages with a capacity of 485 seats. They were built with a maximum speed of 300&#160;km/h (186&#160;mph) and 8,800&#160;kW of power under 25&#160;kV.</p>
<p>Modified unit 325 <a href="/wiki/TGV_world_speed_record" id="w">set the world speed record</a> in 1990 on the new LGV before its opening. Various modifications, such as improved <a href="/wiki/Aerodynamics" id="w">aerodynamics</a>, larger wheels and improved braking, were made to enable speeds of over 500&#160;km/h (310&#160;mph). The set was reduced to two power cars and three carriages to improve the power-to-weight ratio, weighing 250 tonnes (275 short tons). Three carriages, including the bar carriage in the centre, is the minimum possible configuration because of the articulation.</p>

The first Réseau (Network) sets entered service in 1993. Fifty bi-current sets were ordered in 1990, supplemented by an order for 40 tri-current sets in 1992/1993. Ten of the tri-current sets carry the <a href="/wiki/Thalys" id="w">Thalys</a> livery and are known as Thalys PBA (Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam) sets. As well as using standard French voltages, the tri-current sets can operate under the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a>&#39; 1.5 kV and <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgian</a> 3 kV DC supplies.</p>
<p>They are formed of two power cars (8,800&#160;kW under 25&#160;kV - as TGV Atlantique) and eight carriages, giving a capacity of 377 seats. They have a top speed of 300&#160;km/h. They are 200&#160;m (656&#160;ft) long and are 2.90&#160;m (9.5&#160;ft) wide. The bi-current sets weigh 383 tonnes (422 short tons): owing to axle-load restrictions in Belgium the tri-current sets have a series of modifications, such as the replacement of <a href="/wiki/Steel" id="w">steel</a> with <a href="/wiki/Aluminium" id="w">aluminium</a> and hollow axles, to reduce the weight to under 17 tonnes (19 short tons) per axle.</p>
<p>Owing to early complaints of uncomfortable pressure changes when entering tunnels at high speed on the LGV Atlantique, the Réseau sets are now pressure-sealed. They can be also coupled to a Duplex set.</p>

The Eurostar train is essentially a long TGV, modified for use in the United Kingdom and in the <a href="/wiki/Channel_Tunnel" id="w">Channel Tunnel</a>. Differences include a smaller cross section to fit within the constrictive British <a href="/wiki/Loading_gauge" id="w">loading gauge</a>, British-designed <a href="/wiki/Asynchrony" id="w">asynchronous</a> traction motors, and extensive <a href="/wiki/Fireproofing" id="w">fireproofing</a>.</p>
<p>In the UK, it is known under the <a href="/wiki/TOPS" id="w">TOPS</a> classification system as class 373. In the planning stages, it was also known as the TransManche Super Train (Cross-channel Super Train). The trains were built by GEC-Alsthom (now Alstom) in <a href="/wiki/La_Rochelle" id="w">La Rochelle</a> (France), <a href="/wiki/Belfort" id="w">Belfort</a> (France) and <a href="/wiki/Washwood_Heath" id="w">Washwood Heath</a> (England), entering service in 1993.</p>
<p>Two types were built: the Three Capitals sets, consisting of two power cars and 18 carriages, including two with one powered bogie each, and the North of London sets, consisting of two power cars and 14 carriages, again with two with one powered bogie each. Full sets of both types consist of two identical half-sets which are not articulated in the middle, so that in case of emergency in the Channel Tunnel one half can be uncoupled and leave the tunnel. Each half-set is numbered separately.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight full sets, plus one spare power car, were ordered: 16 by SNCF, four by <a href="/wiki/NMBS/SNCB" id="w">NMBS/SNCB</a>, and 18 by <a href="/wiki/British_Rail" id="w">British Rail</a>, of which seven were North of London sets.

<p>The sets operate at a maximum speed of 300&#160;km/h (186&#160;mph), with the power cars supplying 12,240&#160;kW of power. The Three Capitals sets are 394&#160;m (1,293&#160;ft) long and have 766 seats, weighing a total of 752 tonnes (829 short tons; 740 long tons). The North of London sets have 558 seats. All are at least tri-current and are able to operate on 25&#160;kV, 50&#160;Hz AC (on LGVs, including <a href="/wiki/High_Speed_1" id="w">High Speed 1</a>, and on UK overhead electrified lines), 3&#160;kV DC on <i>lignes classiques</i> in Belgium and 750&#160;V&#160;DC on the UK former Southern Region <a href="/wiki/Third_rail" id="w">third rail</a> network. The third-rail system will become obsolete in 2007 when the second phase of High Speed 1 is completed between London and the Channel Tunnel, as it uses 25&#160;kV, 50&#160;Hz AC exclusively. Five of the Three Capitals sets owned by SNCF are quadri-current and are able to operate on French <i>lignes classiques</i> at 1500&#160;V DC. </p>
<p>Three of the Three Capitals sets owned by SNCF are in French domestic use and carry the silver and blue TGV livery. The North of London sets, intended to provide direct <a href="/wiki/Regional_Eurostar" id="w">regional Eurostar</a> services from continental Europe to UK cities north of London, using the <a href="/wiki/West_Coast_Main_Line" id="w">West Coast Main Line</a> and the <a href="/wiki/East_Coast_Main_Line" id="w">East Coast Main Line</a>, have never seen international use: budget airlines in the UK offered lower fares. A few of the sets were leased to <a href="/wiki/Great_North_Eastern_Railway" id="w">GNER</a> for use on its <i>White Rose</i> service between London and Leeds, with two of them carrying GNER&#39;s dark blue livery. The lease ended in December 2005.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Chief Executive of Eurostar, Richard Brown, has suggested that the trains could be replaced by double-decker trains similar to the TGV Duplex when they are withdrawn. A double-deck fleet could carry 40 million passengers per year from England to <a href="/wiki/Continental_Europe" id="w">Continental Europe</a>, equivalent to adding an extra runway at a London airport.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eurostar has higher security measures than other TGVs. Luggage is screened and passengers are theoretically required to check in 30 minutes before departure, although this requirement is seldom if ever enforced. In addition, passengers entering or leaving the UK have to pass customs and identity checks.</p>

{{main}}
The Duplex was built to increase TGV capacity without increasing train length or the number of trains. Each carriage has two levels, with access doors at the lower level, taking advantage of low French <a href="/wiki/Railway_platform" id="w">platforms</a>. A staircase gives access to the upper level, where the gangway between carriages is located. This layout provides 512 seats per set. On busy routes such as Paris-Marseille they are operated in pairs, providing 1,024 seats in a single train of two duplex sets but multiple transet formations of 1 duplex and 1 reseau are commonly seen for capacities of 800 people. Each set has a wheelchair accessible compartment.</p>
<p>After a lengthy development process starting in 1988 (during which they were known as the TGV-2N), they were built in two batches: 30 between 1995 and 1998 and 34 between 2000 and 2004. They weigh 386 tonnes (425 short tons; 379 long tons) and are 200&#160;m (656&#160;ft) long, made up of two power cars and eight <a href="/wiki/Double_decker" id="w">bi-level</a> carriages. Extensive use of aluminium means that they weigh not much more than the TGV Réseau sets they supplement. The bi-current power cars provide a total power of 8,800&#160;kW, and they have a slightly increased speed of 320&#160;km/h (199&#160;mph).</p>

Unlike Thalys PBA sets, the PBKA (Paris-Brussels-Köln (Cologne) -Amsterdam) sets were built exclusively for the Thalys service. They are technologically similar to TGV Duplex sets, but without bi-level carriages. They are quadri-current, operating under 25&#160;kV, 50&#160;Hz&#160;AC (LGVs), 15&#160;kV 16⅔&#160;Hz&#160;AC (Germany, Switzerland), 3&#160;kV&#160;DC (Belgium) and 1,5&#160;kV&#160;DC (the Netherlands and French <i>lignes classiques</i>). Their top speed in service is 300&#160;km/h (186&#160;mph) under 25&#160;kV, with two power cars supplying 8,800&#160;kW. When operating under 15&#160;kV power output drops to 4,460&#160;kW, resulting in a very poor power-to-weight-ratio on German high-speed lines. They have eight carriages and are 200&#160;m (656&#160;ft) long, weighing a total of 385 tonnes (424 short tons; 379 long tons). They have 377 seats.</p>
<p>Seventeen trains were ordered, nine by SNCB, six by SNCF and two by <a href="/wiki/Nederlandse_Spoorwegen" id="w">NS</a>. <a href="/wiki/Deutsche_Bahn" id="w">Deutsche Bahn</a> contributed to financing two of the SNCB sets.</p>
<a id="TGV_POS" name="TGV_POS"></a><h2>TGV POS</h2>
<p>{{main}}
TGV POS (Paris-Ostfrankreich-Süddeutschland or Paris-Eastern France-Southern Germany) are used on the LGV Est.</p>
<p>They consist of two power cars with eight TGV Réseau type carriages, with a total power output of 9,600&#160;kW and a top speed of 320&#160;km/h (199&#160;mph). Unlike TGV-A, TGV-R and TGV-D, it has asynchronous motors, and isolation of an individual motor in a powered bogie is possible in case of failure. They will weigh 423 tonnes (466 short tons; 416 long tons).</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The new configuration scheme for TGV trains would increase capacity by 10% by 2010.</div></div>

The development of TGV trains is being pursued in the form of the <b><a href="/wiki/Automotrice_%C3%A0_grande_vitesse" id="w">AGV</a></b>, <i> <b>a</b>utomotrice à <b>g</b>rande <b>v</b>itesse </i> (high speed multiple unit), similar to the Deutsche Bahn&#39;s ICE-3 (marketed as <a href="/wiki/Siemens_Velaro" id="w">Velaro</a> by Siemens). The AGV design has motors under each carriage. Investigations are being carried out with the aim of producing trains at the same cost as existing TGVs with the same safety standards. AGVs of the same length as TGVs could have up to 450 seats. The target speed is 350&#160;km/h (217&#160;mph).</p>
<p>In the short term, plans are being considered to increase the capacity of TGVs by 10% by replacing the central two power cars of a double TGV with passenger carriages. These carriages would have motorized bogies underneath them, as would the first and last carriage of the train, to make up for the lost power. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.entreprise-sncf.com/sncf_demain/tgvgp.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.entreprise-sncf.com/sncf_demain/tgvgp.html">http://www.entreprise-sncf.com/sncf_demain/tgvgp.html</a></p>
<a id="Safety" name="Safety"></a><h1>Safety</h1>
<p>{{main}}
In more than two decades of high-speed operation, the TGV has not recorded a single fatality due to accident while running at high speed. There have been several accidents, including three derailments at or above 270&#160;km/h (168&#160;mph), but in none of these did any carriages overturn. This is credited in part to the stiffness that the articulated design lends to the train. There have been fatal accidents involving TGVs on <i>lignes classiques</i>, where the trains are exposed to the same dangers as normal trains, such as <a href="/wiki/Level_crossing" id="w">level crossings</a>.</p>

<li><a href="/wiki/25_September" id="w">25 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>: TGV 7119 from Paris to <a href="/wiki/Dunkerque" id="w">Dunkerque</a>, operated by set 502, collided at 130&#160;km/h (81&#160;mph) with a 70 tonne (77 short ton; 69 long ton) asphalt paving machine on a level crossing at Bierne, near Dunkerque. The power car spun round and fell down an embankment. The front two carriages left the track and came to a stop in woods beside the track. Seven people were injured.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/31_October" id="w">31 October</a> <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>: TGV 8515 from Paris to Irun derailed at 130&#160;km/h (81&#160;mph) near <a href="/wiki/Dax%2C_Landes" id="w">Dax</a> in southwest France. All ten carriages derailed and the rear power unit fell over. The cause was a broken rail.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/30_January" id="w">30 January</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>: a TGV from Dunkerque to Paris collided at 106&#160;km/h (66&#160;mph) with a heavy goods vehicle stuck on the level crossing at Esquelbecq in northern France. The front power car was severely damaged, but only one bogie derailed. Only the driver was slightly injured.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/19_December" id="w">19 December</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>: a TGV train from Paris to Geneva collided at about 100&#160;km/h (62&#160;mph) with a truck on a level crossing near <a href="/wiki/Tossiat" id="w">Tossiat</a> in eastern France, near the Swiss border. The driver of the truck died; on the train, one was seriously injured and 24 were slightly injured.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>Following the number of accidents at level crossings, an effort has been made to remove all level crossings on <i>lignes classiques</i> used by TGVs. The <i>ligne classique</i> from <a href="/wiki/Tours" id="w">Tours</a> to <a href="/wiki/Bordeaux" id="w">Bordeaux</a> at the end of the LGV Atlantique has no level crossings as a result.</p>
<a id="Protests_against_the_TGV" name="Protests_against_the_TGV"></a><h1>Protests against the TGV</h1>
<p>The first environmental protests against the building of a high-speed line in France occurred in May 1990 during the planning stages of the LGV Méditerranée. Protesters blocked a railway viaduct to protest against the planned route, arguing that it was unnecessary, and that trains could use existing lines to reach Marseille from Lyon.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Lyon_Turin_Ferroviaire" id="w">Lyon Turin Ferroviaire</a> (<a href="/wiki/Lyon" id="w">Lyon</a>-<a href="/wiki/Chamb%C3%A9ry" id="w">Chambéry</a>-<a href="/wiki/Turin" id="w">Turin</a>), which would connect the TGV to the <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italian</a> <a href="/wiki/Treno_Alta_Velocit%C3%A0" id="w">TAV</a> network, has been the subject of demonstrations in Italy. While most Italian political parties agree on the construction of this line, inhabitants of the towns where construction would take place are vehemently opposing it. The concerns of the protesters centre around storing dangerous materials mined from mountain, like <a href="/wiki/Asbestos" id="w">asbestos</a> and <a href="/wiki/Uranium" id="w">uranium</a>, in the open air. This serious health danger could be avoided by using more appropriate but expensive techniques for handling radioactive materials. A six-month delay in the start of construction has been decided in order to study solutions. In addition to the concerns of the residents, a ten-year-old national movement opposes the development of Italy&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Treno_Alta_Velocit%C3%A0" id="w">TAV</a> <a href="/wiki/High-speed_rail" id="w">high-speed rail</a> network as a whole.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>This is opposed by a national movement that opposes the development of high-speed rail, RFB.</p>
<p>General complaints about the noise of TGVs passing near towns and villages have led the SNCF to build acoustic fencing along large sections of LGVs to reduce the disturbance to residents, but protests still take place where SNCF has not addressed the issue.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
