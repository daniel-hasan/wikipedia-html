The <b>Trent and Mersey Canal</b> is a 93.5 miles (150 km) long <a href="/wiki/Canal" id="w">canal</a> in the East Midlands, West Midlands, and  North West of England.  It is mostly a &#34;narrow canal&#34; (locks and bridges big enough for a <a href="/wiki/Narrowboat" id="w">narrowboat</a> 72 feet long x 7 feet wide) but east of <a href="/wiki/Burton_upon_Trent" id="w">Burton on Trent</a>, it is a wide canal (locks and bridges can accommodate boats 14ft wide). </p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>

<p>As its name implies, the Trent &#38; Mersey canal was built (opened 1777) to link the <a href="/wiki/River_Trent" id="w">River Trent</a> at Derwent Mouth (in <a href="/wiki/Derbyshire" id="w">Derbyshire</a>) to the <a href="/wiki/River_Mersey" id="w">River Mersey</a>.  The second connection is made via the <a href="/wiki/Bridgewater_Canal" id="w">Bridgewater Canal</a>, which it joins at <a href="/wiki/Preston_Brook" id="w">Preston Brook</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cheshire" id="w">Cheshire</a>.  Note that although mileposts measure the distance to Preston Brook and <a href="/wiki/Shardlow" id="w">Shardlow</a>, Derwent mouth is a mile or so beyond Shardlow. </p>
<p>The idea of a canal connection from the Mersey to the Trent (&#34;The Grand Trunk&#34;) came from canal <a href="/wiki/Engineer" id="w">engineer</a> <a href="/wiki/James_Brindley" id="w">James Brindley</a>. It was authorised by an Act of <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain" id="w">Parliament</a> in <a href="/wiki/1766" id="w">1766</a> and the first <a href="/wiki/Sod" id="w">sod</a> was cut by <a href="/wiki/Josiah_Wedgwood" id="w">Josiah Wedgwood</a> in July that year at <a href="/wiki/Middleport%2C_Staffordshire" id="w">Middleport</a>. Less than eleven years later, the whole canal, including more than 70 <a href="/wiki/Canal_lock" id="w">locks</a> and five <a href="/wiki/Tunnel" id="w">tunnels</a>, was open, with the company headquarters in <a href="/wiki/Stone%2C_Staffordshire" id="w">Stone</a>.</p>
<p>The Grand Trunk was a part of a larger scheme of <a href="/wiki/James_Brindley" id="w">Brindley&#39;s</a> to link the four main rivers of England (<a href="/wiki/River_Trent" id="w">Trent</a>, <a href="/wiki/River_Mersey" id="w">Mersey</a>, <a href="/wiki/River_Severn" id="w">Severn</a> and <a href="/wiki/River_Thames" id="w">Thames</a>) in a project known as the &#34;Grand Cross&#34;<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Trent and Mersey Canal provided the Northern Arm of the Cross (to the Mersey), and the Eastern Arm (to the Trent). It also provided the central &#34;hub&#34; of the cross, between Great Haywood, and Fradley Junctions.</p>
<p>The Western Arm, to the Severn was built as the <a href="/wiki/Staffordshire_and_Worcestershire_Canal" id="w">Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal</a>, whilst the Southern Arm (to the Thames) traversed the <a href="/wiki/Coventry_Canal" id="w">Coventry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oxford_Canal" id="w">Oxford</a> Canals</p>
<a id="Features" name="Features"></a><h1>Features</h1>

<p>A special feature on the Cheshire stretch of the canal is the <a href="/wiki/Anderton_Boat_Lift" id="w">Anderton Boat Lift</a>. Until the construction of the <a href="/wiki/Falkirk_Wheel" id="w">Falkirk Wheel</a> in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>, it was the only operational boat-lift in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>Another major feature is the <a href="/wiki/Harecastle_Tunnel" id="w">Harecastle Tunnel</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Kidsgrove" id="w">Kidsgrove</a> in the city of <a href="/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent" id="w">Stoke-on-Trent</a>, north <a href="/wiki/Staffordshire" id="w">Staffordshire</a>. There are actually two tunnels. The first tunnel, built by Brindley was 2880 yards (2633 m) long; barges were &#39;legged&#39; through by men lying on their backs and pushing against the roof with their feet. This was a physically demanding and slow process and created major delays, so leading <a href="/wiki/Civil_engineer" id="w">civil engineer</a> <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Telford" id="w">Thomas Telford</a> was commissioned to provide a second and wider, parallel tunnel, with a towpath. This 2926 yard (2676 m) long tunnel was opened in <a href="/wiki/1827" id="w">1827</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/1900s" id="w">1900s</a>, the Brindley tunnel was closed due to severe subsidence, but the Telford Tunnel - although also prone to the same problems - remains in use, and is the fourth longest navigable canal tunnel in the UK.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Junction with the Hall Green Branch</div></div>
</p>
<p>The junction with the <a href="/wiki/Hall_Green_Branch" id="w">Hall Green Branch</a>, which leads to the <a href="/wiki/Macclesfield_Canal" id="w">Macclesfield Canal</a>, at Red Bull, is unusual.  At this point the main line is running approximately E/W.  The branch leaves the main line at a normal right angle junction (Hardings Wood Junction) to the South, but then turns 90 degrees clockwise to run parallel with the main line (West) while the main line drops through 2 locks.  The branch then turns through another 90 degrees to face North, and crosses the main line on Poole Lock aqueduct, and the A50 on Red Bull aqueduct (Red Bull is the name of the pub and small settlement, called &#34;Red Cow&#34; in Arnold Bennett&#39;s novels). There is only one other such &#34;flyover&#34; junction on the English canal network, where the <a href="/wiki/Caldon_Canal" id="w">Caldon Canal</a> (which itself joins the T&#38;M in nearby Stoke on Trent) splits at Hazelhurst Junction, the Leek Branch thereafter crosses the main line.    </p>
<p>The canal passes through the centre of the city of <a href="/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent" id="w">Stoke-on-Trent</a>, where it formed an integral part of the <a href="/wiki/1986" id="w">1986</a> <a href="/wiki/National_Garden_Festival" id="w">National Garden Festival</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent_Garden_Festival" id="w">Stoke-on-Trent Garden Festival</a>. The canal&#39;s towpath forms a vital part of the city&#39;s <a href="/wiki/National_Cycle_Network" id="w">National Cycle Network</a>, and Connolly Basnett Loop.</p>
<a id="Route" name="Route"></a><h1>Route</h1>
<p>The route is conveniently divided into a northern and southern section by <a href="/wiki/Harecastle_Tunnel" id="w">Harecastle Tunnel</a></p>
<a id="Northern_T%26M" name="Northern_T%26M"></a><h2>Northern T&#38;M</h2>
<p>The Northern end of the canal makes an end-on junction with the <a href="/wiki/Bridgewater_Canal" id="w">Bridgewater Canal</a> within Preston Brook Tunnel, from whereone can access  Runcorn (but no longer the Mersey or Ship Canal) in one direction and Manchester (with its many canal links) in the other.</p>
<p>From the junction with the Bridgewater Canal, the T&#38;M travels south through Preston Brook Tunnel (one-way operation, alternating each half hour) and two smaller tunnels (Saltersford and Barnton) to the &#34;junction&#34; with the <a href="/wiki/River_Weaver" id="w">River Weaver</a> at <a href="/wiki/Anderton_Boat_Lift" id="w">Anderton Boat Lift</a> near <a href="/wiki/Northwich" id="w">Northwich</a>.</p>
<p>After Anderton, the next major destination is <a href="/wiki/Middlewich" id="w">Middlewich</a>, where a junction with the 50 yard long <a href="/wiki/Wardle_Canal" id="w">Wardle Canal</a> leads to the <a href="/wiki/Middlewich_Branch" id="w">Middlewich Branch</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Shropshire_Union_Canal" id="w">Shropshire Union Canal</a> which gives access to <a href="/wiki/Chester" id="w">Chester</a>, <a href="/wiki/Llangollen" id="w">Llangollen</a> and (south on the &#34;Shroppie&#34;) a parallel route to <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" id="w">Birmingham</a>/<a href="/wiki/Wolverhampton" id="w">Wolverhampton</a>.</p>
<p>South of Middlewich, having passed through <a href="/wiki/Wheelock" id="w">Wheelock</a> the T&#38;M climbs out of the Cheshire Plain via the &#34;Heartbreak Hill&#34; locks (more traditionally the &#34;Cheshire Locks&#34;) to the summit-level and the junction with the <a href="/wiki/Hall_Green_Branch" id="w">Hall Green Branch</a>, leading to the <a href="/wiki/Macclesfield_Canal" id="w">Macclesfield Canal</a> at Red Bull (Kidsgrove).  The boater can use the Macclesfield Canal to head for Marple, and the junction with the Peak forest Canal (and hence, via the Ashton, Rochdale and Bridgewater canal) to complete the <i><a href="/wiki/Cheshire_Ring" id="w">Cheshire Ring</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Southern_T%26M" name="Southern_T%26M"></a><h2>Southern T&#38;M</h2>
<p>After the long (40 minute) <a href="/wiki/Harecastle_Tunnel" id="w">Harecastle Tunnel</a> (one way, alternating roughly every two hours), the canal emerges in the outskirts of <a href="/wiki/Stoke_on_Trent" id="w">Stoke on Trent</a>, and is soon in the middle of the city and then at <a href="/wiki/Etruria" id="w">Etruria</a>, and the junction with the <a href="/wiki/Caldon_Canal" id="w">Caldon Canal</a>.</p>
<p>Leaving Etruria, the T&#38;M is soon back in open country.  It is now in the valley of the infant <a href="/wiki/River_Trent" id="w">River Trent</a> (which the T&#38;M follows until the River becomes navigable and the canal is no longer needed).</p>
<p>The next sizeable place is the Market town of <a href="/wiki/Stone%2C_Staffordshire" id="w">Stone</a>.</p>
<p>After more countryside, the canal reaches <a href="/wiki/Great_Haywood" id="w">Great Haywood</a> and the towpath bridge across the junction with the <a href="/wiki/Staffordshire_and_Worcestershire_Canal" id="w">Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal</a> (which heads south to skirt <a href="/wiki/Wolverhampton" id="w">Wolverhampton</a> and join with the <a href="/wiki/River_Severn" id="w">River Severn</a> at <a href="/wiki/Stourport" id="w">Stourport</a> - thus connecting the Mersey with the Severn).</p>
<p>The next event is a right angle bend, of no apparent significance from the boat - but a map shows that this is where the canal (and the Trent) changes its basic direction - from SW (heading away from Runcorn) to NE (heading towards Nottingham).</p>
<p>Very near is Fradley Junction (with the <a href="/wiki/Coventry_Canal" id="w">Coventry Canal(detatched portion</a>).  The Coventry soon leads to the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal and branches off to <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" id="w">Birmingham</a> or (via another stretch of Coventry Canal) to <a href="/wiki/Coventry" id="w">Coventry</a> and a junction with the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_Canal" id="w">Oxford Canal</a> and hence to all the &#34;Southern Half&#34; of the English canals.</p>
<p>The canal now heads directly to its terminus, passing through <a href="/wiki/Burton_on_Trent" id="w">Burton on Trent</a> and then (through wide locks, the first being at Stenson) to <a href="/wiki/Shardlow" id="w">Shardlow</a> (a canal village, formerly the home of the T&#38;M company offices) and, finally, Derwent Mouth.</p>
<p>It is not far from Derwent Mouth, via the <a href="/wiki/River_Trent" id="w">River Trent</a> to <a href="/wiki/Trent_Lock" id="w">Trent Lock</a>, the four-way junction with the <a href="/wiki/Erewash_Canal" id="w">Erewash Canal</a> (dead end at Great Northern Basin, formerly a link with the <a href="/wiki/Cromford_Canal" id="w">Cromford Canal</a>), the <a href="/wiki/Nottingham_Canal" id="w">Nottingham Canal</a> (links back to the Trent in <a href="/wiki/Nottingham" id="w">Nottingham</a>) and the <a href="/wiki/River_Soar" id="w">River Soar</a> Navigation (links via <a href="/wiki/Leicester" id="w">Leicester</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Union_Canal" id="w">Grand Union Canal</a>).</p>
