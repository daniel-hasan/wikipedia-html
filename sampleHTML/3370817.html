<b>Princeton Day School</b> is a private <a href="/wiki/Coeducation" id="w">coeducational</a> <a href="/wiki/Day_school" id="w">day school</a> located in <a href="/wiki/Princeton_Township%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Princeton Township</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a>. The Princeton Day School currently enrolls 904 students in grades junior kindergarten - 12. The largest division is the Upper School (grades 9-12), with an enrollment of approximately 400.</p>
<p>An average of nearly 20 percent of Princeton Day School seniors over past five years have been honored as semi-finalists or commended scholars in the <a href="/wiki/National_Merit_Scholarship_Program" id="w">National Merit Scholarship Program</a>. Annually, approximately 20 percent of the PDS graduating class is accepted to <a href="/wiki/Ivy_League" id="w">Ivy League</a> colleges, <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" id="w">Stanford</a>, <a href="/wiki/Duke_University" id="w">Duke</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" id="w">University of Chicago</a> or <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" id="w">MIT</a>.  Approximately 85 percent of the Class of 2007 attend colleges rated “Most Competitive” or “Highly Competitive” by <a href="/wiki/Barron%26%2339%3Bs_Educational_Series" id="w">Barrons</a>, and 16 percent attend Ivy League institutions.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In September of 2005, the school launched the public phase of a five year $50 million capital campaign, &#34;Investing in Excellence&#34; to support new and renovated facilities and increased endowment for faculty salaries and financial aid. As of August of 2006, $40 million in commitments had been received, including an $11 million gift for financial aid, the largest gift ever made to an independent co-ed day school.</p>
<p>The school is a member of the <a href="/wiki/National_Association_of_Independent_Schools" id="w">National Association of Independent Schools</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey_Association_of_Independent_Schools" id="w">New Jersey Association of Independent Schools</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Association_of_Delaware_Valley_Independent_Schools" id="w">Association of Delaware Valley Independent Schools</a>.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>

<p>Founded in 1899, Miss Fine&#39;s School in Princeton prepared girls for college with a curriculum including English, French, Latin, history and mathematics, at a time when women were not expected to attend college, and when only one out of eight children in America went to school at all.  For years, the institution was, quite literally, <i>Miss Fine&#39;s</i> School; in addition to serving as Headmistress, May Margaret Fine taught all the subjects but French, maintained an individual interest in her students, and even &#34;tended the furnace....often leaving in the middle of Latin class to do it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-shines_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shines" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#34;A large shapeless figure [with] a pile of white hair dominated by a bun on the top, which usually slid over to the side of her head by the end of the day,&#34;<sup id="_ref-roots_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roots" title="">[3]</a></sup> Fine was, despite her appearance, a loved and respected figure.  John Finley, editor of <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">The New York Times</a></i> during the 1910s, wrote of her, &#34;So was the school under her wise and gentle rule a place where happy children grew into her spirited likeness.&#34;<sup id="_ref-shines_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shines" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Fine retired in 1931 and died two years later.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1924, a group of parents established an elementary school for boys on Bayard Lane, next to Miss Fine&#39;s School. The boys&#39; school was known as Princeton Country Day School.  Princeton Country Day merged with Miss Fine&#39;s School in 1965 to become Princeton Day School. Princeton Day School&#39;s campus along The Great Road in Princeton opened in 1965, thanks to the contributions of Dean Mathey.</p>
<a id="Traditions" name="Traditions"></a><h2>Traditions</h2>
<p>Over the years, Princeton Day School has enjoyed many traditions that no longer take place.  These include an Upper School pie-eating competition (with each grade pitted against each other) that continued until the eighties, an annual sophomore-junior canoeing trip, intended to bridge the gap between two grades that traditionally do not share many classes, and legendary English teacher Anne Shepherd&#39;s wreathmaking assembly.  The wreathmaking rite started in Miss Fine&#39;s School in 1900, and since, by the 1980s, participation in the event had dwindled, it was cancelled.  A December 1982 article in PDS&#39;s student-run newspaper, the <i>Spokesman</i>, explained that “This [announcement] raised such an uproar that, by popular demand, the [assembly] was given one last chance.”<sup id="_ref-Source B_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Source B" title="">[5]</a></sup>  By the 1990s, though, wreathmaking was gone, indicative of the passing of certain traditions over time.  (Another tradition that began at Miss Fine&#39;s, the annual <a href="/wiki/Maypole" id="w">Maypole</a> Dance, actually continues today, though it is now performed by second graders instead of Upper Schoolers.)</p>
<p>New traditions have joined the <a href="/wiki/Maypole" id="w">Maypole</a> Dance in recent years, including the annual <a href="/wiki/Powder_Puff" id="w">Powder Puff</a> game, a fiercely competitive touch football match between the junior and senior girls that has been held since 2004, and <a href="/wiki/Dr._Seuss" id="w">Dr. Seuss</a> Day, a day of boisterous noise and frosted cake in the otherwise tightly-run Upper School library.  Two of PDS&#39;s most celebrated current traditions are the Halloween Parade, and Blue &#38; White Day.</p>
<a id="Halloween_Challenge/Parade" name="Halloween_Challenge/Parade"></a><h3>Halloween Challenge/Parade</h3>
<p>For at least 20 years (beginning by 1984 at the latest, and ending in 2003), the senior challenge, or the Halloween Challenge, had been a yearly PDS tradition.  A collection of four Halloween-themed skits performed by each Upper School grade in front of the extended Lower School, Middle School and faculty each Halloween, the competition was introduced each October during announcement period, where the seniors would unexpectedly take control of the microphone and issue a public challenge to the other three grades.</p>
<p>The skits usually took the form of elaborately-scripted adaptations of well-known ghost stories or mysteries, including, memorably, &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Raven" id="w">The Raven</a>,&#34; <i><a href="/wiki/Where_the_Wild_Things_Are" id="w">Where the Wild Things Are</a></i>, and a version of Michael Jackson’s <i><a href="/wiki/Thriller_(music_video)" id="w">Thriller</a></i> featuring then-Dean of X Harvey Lee moonwalking.  Though the winner was chosen by supposedly impartial judges, the senior skit invariably won; when, in October 2002, sophomores won what turned out to be the final Challenge, the <i>Spokesman</i> declared it “a stunning upset.”<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  It was only the third time since 1988 that seniors had not won the Challenge.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Halloween Challenge was officially canceled that April, in an “announcement [that] was followed by a collective groan and boos from the audience.”<sup id="_ref-challenge_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-challenge" title="">[8]</a></sup>  It was replaced with a similar type of competition, a Halloween-day parade where the grade with the best costumes won.  Then-Community-Council-president Kyle Hogan ’05 explained that “skits in the past few years have deteriorated to the point where they not only lack school spirit, but they are blatantly inappropriate,” citing the senior skit, which had featured senior Pete Rossi stripped down to only a bowtie and his underwear.  <sup id="_ref-challenge_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-challenge" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Blue_%26_White_Day" name="Blue_%26_White_Day"></a><h3>Blue &#38; White Day</h3>

<p>On Blue &#38; White Field Day, an all-school athletic competition held each spring, PDS students often carry a fierce 24-hour sense of patriotism for their color, painting their faces blue or white and engaging in acts of playful discrimination against the opposing team.  Popular Blue-White events include &#34;The Big Race,&#34; which involves students in each grade from JK through 12, a faculty balloon toss (for which students serve as rowdy spectators), and the freestyle sack race.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Blue &#38; White Day was founded by beloved Physical Education teacher Kim Bedesem;<sup id="_ref-why_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-why" title="">[10]</a></sup>  when Bedesem passed away in 1993, it was decided that each subsequent Blue &#38; White Day be dedicated to her.  Each year, the Blue &#38; White Day t-shirts distributed to students and faculty have the name “KIM” hidden somewhere in the design.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>  While Bedesem created Blue &#38; White Day in its present form in the 80s, similar events existed at Miss Fine&#39;s and PCD as much as 60 years earlier.  James Howard Murch, PCD’s first Headmaster, was remembered by his successor for “the pleasurable relish with which he took to interpret[ing] the decimal-splitting rivalries of the Blues and Whites.”<sup id="_ref-roots_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roots" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Miss Fine’s School (whose school colors were voted Blue and Grey by the Class of 1918)<sup id="_ref-time_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-time" title="">[12]</a></sup> had “similar challenges&#34; in which Blues and Greys competed.<sup id="_ref-why_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-why" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Upper School (grades 9-12) returned to Blue and White Day in 2006 following over a decade&#39;s hiatus from the event. Their re-entry into the morning part of the activities was later expanded to include other Blue/White competitions in the Upper School during the rest of the school year.</p>
<a id="GudgeFest" name="GudgeFest"></a><h3>GudgeFest</h3>
<p>GudgeFest, a lawn-chair-throwing competition created by Upper School Latin teacher Todd Gudgel in May 1993, was recently a wildly popular event at PDS; the 2001 turnout was “around 100 people,”<sup id="_ref-lovefest_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lovefest" title="">[13]</a></sup> and the following for the event has been referred to as “cult-like.”<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>  Competitors and spectators alike making the trek to the Colross Lawn are rewarded by an array of refreshments—famously, <a href="/wiki/Root_beer_floats" id="w">root beer floats</a> and Nilla wafers.  GudgeFest’s intent is, in Gudgel’s words, “to explore the Gudge in all of us....It’s [also] a spring into summer ritual, [and] it takes the pressure off of students.  They’ve just finished the AP’s and everything is so structured and it [has been] since the time you were five years old.  This is unstructured.”<sup id="_ref-lovefest_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lovefest" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>This lack of structure has historically led to dangerous results, such as when, at GudgeFest 2000, a student’s chair came close to hitting Upper School religion teacher David Freedholm.  Since 2005 Gudgefest has not occurred due to a lack of student interest in planning the event.  However, 06-07 Community Council President Hugh Wynne created a committee dedicated to planning the event.  The group, called the GudgeFest Renovation, has been able to resurrect the tradition and plans to hold another GudgeFest in spring 2007. The revived event was originally called We Beat A Friar, a mnemonic for memorizing the Latin subjunctive endings, but the name was changed to Saturnalia and then Party-cus after some objected to the choice.  The event successfully happened this spring with Juan Carlos Melendez-Torres winning the competition.</p>
<a id="Honor_Code" name="Honor_Code"></a><h3>Honor Code</h3>
<p>The PDS <a href="/wiki/Honor_Code" id="w">Honor Code</a> was approved in a school-wide referendum in 2006. The current Code, the product of many years of work by successive Council administrations, was the focus of intense debate after being formally introduced to the Upper School in fall of 2005. Entering the philosophical fray were those who thought the school did not need an Honor Code, those who thought each student should be required to sign the Code, and many people holding different positions in between. The referendum held by Council in January 2006 ended in a compromise: each student at PDS would be bound by the Honor Code, but they did not have to physically sign it. The PDS Honor Code reads:</p>
<p>To learn honorably is to live honorably.</p>
<p>In order to foster the development of our community of learners, I will:<br/>
-uphold personal and academic integrity,<br/>
-respect myself and others,<br/>
-act responsibly and lead by example,<br/>
-be honest in my own work,<br/>
-and embrace the values expressed in this code.<br/></p>
<a id="Powderpuff_Football" name="Powderpuff_Football"></a><h3>Powderpuff Football</h3>
<p>One upper school tradition is the annual Powderpuff Football game. The game is played by the girls of the Junior Class against the girls of the Senior Class. Typically, each team is coached by the Junior Boys, and the Senior Boys respectively. The game typically occurs in the beginning of November.</p>


<a id="Administration" name="Administration"></a><h2> Administration </h2>

<a id="Development_of_Coventry_Farm" name="Development_of_Coventry_Farm"></a><h3>Development of Coventry Farm</h3>

<p>In early 2000, the Winant family decided to sell Coventry Farm, a 162-acre property of open, undeveloped space that lay directly adjacent to PDS property.  The family began negotiations to sell the land to the Hillier Group for development.  Hillier hoped to develop 30 of the Farm’s acres; some of their proposed townhouses would be located on the farm’s Upper Meadow, “less than 45 feet from [PDS’s Lower School] playground,” in the words of a December 2000 <i>Spokesman</i> article.<sup id="_ref-urge_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-urge" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>After a failed attempt to work with a Friends of Coventry Farm group to protect the space, PDS’s Environmental Action (EnAct) club, led by Upper School English teacher Liz Cutler, brought the issue to Community Council in November of 2000.  After discussing the issue in Council, and conducting class-wide polls that “were decisively in favor of making every possible effort to save at least part of Coventry Farm,” then-Council-President Nick Sardar &#39;01 drafted a letter to PDS’s Board of Trustees protesting the development.</p>
<p>The letter included the statement that, “In a generation where environmental stability is not assured, preserving the farm as open space would be a timeless paradigm of foresight.  It would be a lesson to the community that the preservation of the environment must be paramount in all of our decisions.”<sup id="_ref-urge_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-urge" title="">[15]</a></sup>  However, prospects for changing the Group’s plans initially seemed remote.  In December, then-Dean of IX Harvey Lee argued that “We can’t just tell [the Board] to reconsider everything….We should ask them if they can do anything, and if not, that’s the way it has to be.”</p>
<a id="Conflict_with_the_Board_of_Trustees" name="Conflict_with_the_Board_of_Trustees"></a><h3>Conflict with the Board of Trustees</h3>

<p>On January 17, 2001, four PDS students spoke in front of the Board of Trustees to “try to persuade them to reconsider their decision to buy into the Hillier Group’s Coventry Farm development.”<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  Then-Council-vice-president Sarah Maloney ’02 explained to the Board, “What worries me more about Coventry Farm [than the environmental implications] is that there was no attempt on the administration or Board’s behalf to find out the students’ feelings.”</p>
<p>Maloney wasn&#39;t alone in her sentiments; for many in the PDS community, the development of Coventry Farm was an intensely felt issue.  The <i>Spokesman</i> ran front-page stories on Coventry Farm for two months straight, and one of their editorials argued that “the [four students&#39;] presentation was an expression of the moral and environmental integrity which they have gained through attending PDS, and a spirit which <i>must</i> replace the Board’s soulless philosophy of &#34;Build Out or Bust.&#34;<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>  Two days after the presentation, the Community Council was told that the Board of Trustees had voted against purchasing the Upper Meadow for open space, hoping to purchase it and use the space for faculty housing.</p>
<p>After several months, though, J. Robert Hillier announced on May 9 that, rather than developing Coventry Farm, he’d decided to sell it to the Delaware and Raritan Greenway organization, explaining that “This is a better plan for Princeton.”<sup id="_ref-saved_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-saved" title="">[18]</a></sup>  In a validation of EnAct and Council&#39;s arguments, PDS&#39;s Board of Trustees then decided to purchase the 11 acres of the Farm closest to school property for $2.5 million, with the intent of preserving it as Open Space.  Board Chairman Daniel J. Graziano explained at the time that “This has been a wonderful demonstration of how the Board can respond to input from the community.”<sup id="_ref-saved_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-saved" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Walks_for_Open_Space" name="Walks_for_Open_Space"></a><h3>Walks for Open Space</h3>

<p>The success of their campaign to preserve the Upper Meadow space inspired PDS’s EnAct club, led by Cutler, to organize a three-mile Walk for Open Space to raise money for open space organizations based in Mercer County.  “Rather than just saying thank you,” EnAct member Thomas Bohnett ’02 explained, “we felt we needed to put our money where our mouths were.&#34;<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Held in Mercer County Park on April 21, 2002, the Walk attracted three hundred participents (most of which were PDS students), raising an astounding total of $43,000<sup id="_ref-cutler_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cutler" title="">[20]</a></sup> (a great deal of which came from corporate sponsorships with local businesses, including the Hillier Group).<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>  The part of that sum dedicated to the Upper Meadow served to help defray the Board’s $2.5 million purchase.</p>
<p>A second Walk for Open Space organized by the EnAct club in April 2004 was less successful, with 200 participants raising a total of $16,500.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>  Cutler however, had explained to <i>The Princeton Packet</i> in 2003 that size, for her at least, didn’t necessarily matter.  “The ripple effect of having 10 to 15 kids [from the EnAct club] go out every year into the world who will form pockets of activism and world-changing— maybe that&#39;s worth its weight in gold.”<sup id="_ref-cutler_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cutler" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Clubs_and_activities" name="Clubs_and_activities"></a><h2>Clubs and activities</h2>
<p>Student-run publications at Princeton Day School include the <i>Spokesman</i>, an award-winning Upper School newspaper published eight times a year, and its Middle School sister publication, the <i>Spokeskid</i>.  A yearly literary and arts magazine called <i>Cymbals</i> is also published, along with the annual yearbook, the <i>Link</i>.</p>

<li>Coats and ties for male students were required until 1975, when the PDS Administration relaxed the dress code.  T-shirts and denim, though, remained barred until 1994, when the Administration, according to the <i>Spokesman</i>, “effectively abolishe[d the] dress code under pressure from Community Council.”<sup id="_ref-time_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-time" title="">[12]</a></sup></li>
<li>An independent school newspaper, the <i>Observer</i>, was founded by a group of PDS students in 1973 and was published for several years, in an attempt to provide more honest and uncensored coverage than a school-sponsored publication like the <i>Spokesman</i> was able to offer.  The two publications engaged in a competition which seemed at times to be decidedly less than friendly; a front-page article in the May 19, 1975 <i>Spokesman</i> was devoted to pointing out a mistake the <i>Observer</i> had made in a recent issue, stating, &#34;Like Chicken Little thinking that the sky was falling, the <i>Observer</i> assumed that the ravine was being filled in.&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></li>
