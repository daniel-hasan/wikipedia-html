The impressively tall, craggy featured Josiah Power was one of America’s best lawyers until his <a href="/wiki/Metahuman" id="w">metagene</a> was triggered during the alien <a href="/wiki/Invasion!_(DC_Comics)" id="w">Invasion</a> by the activation of the <b>Gene Bomb</b>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following the untimely public activation of his metagene in the court room, corporate attorney Josiah Power was dismissed from his law firm. Power had little interest in becoming a traditional costumed hero, but it became readily apparent that he could not continue to practice law without undue public attention. </p>

Working his way through a short depression and other problems, Josiah eventually found a way to combine his old skills and newfound abilities. He decided to found a business of <i>superheroes for hire</i>, structured like a law firm, with partners and associates.</p>
<p>He called his new team, the <b>Power Company</b>. During his tenure in the team, he was put into a coma from a gunshot wound and <a href="/wiki/Firestorm_(comics)" id="w">Firestorm</a> became an associate. He has since recovered and has continued active duty. Josiah lives with his <a href="/wiki/Life_partner" id="w">life partner</a> Rupert.</p>

<li>He rarely participates in the Company’s missions.  He has made exceptions but only when the situation was dire. When he activates his powers Josiah transforms into a monstrous, grey, stone-like seven foot giant, and an energy corona begins to spark about his body. He gains great strength, invulnerability and possibly other energy based powers.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li>At one point, after seeing him in action, <a href="/wiki/Superman" id="w">Superman</a> stated that Josiah was one of the most powerful metas he&#39;d ever met.</li></ul>
