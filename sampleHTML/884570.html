It was released in <a href="/wiki/2006_in_video_gaming" id="w">2006</a>, and was the first <a href="/wiki/Single_player" id="w">single player</a> <i>Final Fantasy</i> title of the main series since <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X" id="w">Final Fantasy X</a></i> five years earlier.<sup id="_ref-5years_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5years" title="">[1]</a></sup> Selling more than two million copies in Japan,<sup id="_ref-2mil_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2mil" title="">[2]</a></sup> it became the fourth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of 2006 worldwide.<sup id="_ref-4thbest_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4thbest" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The game takes place in the <a href="/wiki/Fictional_location" id="w">fictional location</a> called <a href="/wiki/Ivalice" id="w">Ivalice</a>, where the empires of Archadia and Rozarria are waging an endless war. Dalmasca, a small kingdom, is caught between the warring nations. When Archadia invades and occupies Dalmasca, its princess, Ashe, creates a resistance movement. During the struggle, she meets Vaan, a young adventurer who dreams of commanding an airship. They are quickly joined by a band of allies; together, they rally against the tyranny of the Archadian Empire.</p>
<p><i>Final Fantasy XII</i> introduced several innovations to the series: battles occur without a transition to a separate screen; a &#34;gambit&#34; system automatically controls the actions of characters; and a &#34;license&#34; system determines which abilities and equipment are used by characters.<sup id="_ref-IGNreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNreview" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Gamespotreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gamespotreview" title="">[5]</a></sup> <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> also includes elements from previous games in the series, such as <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_magic#Summoning Magic" id="w">summoned monsters</a>,<sup id="_ref-Gamespotreview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gamespotreview" title="">[5]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Chocobo" id="w">Chocobos</a>,<sup id="_ref-GUIDE14_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE14" title="">[6]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Airship_(Final_Fantasy)" id="w">airships</a>.<sup id="_ref-IGNreview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNreview" title="">[4]</a></sup> The game received universally high scores, and earned numerous &#34;<a href="/wiki/Game_of_the_Year" id="w">Game of the Year</a>&#34; awards in various categories from noted <a href="/wiki/Video_game_journalism" id="w">video game publications</a>. The sequel, <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XII:_Revenant_Wings" id="w">Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings</a></i>, was released for the <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_DS" id="w">Nintendo DS</a> on <a href="/wiki/April_26" id="w">April 26</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> in Japan and was released in North America on <a href="/wiki/November_20" id="w">November 20</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Gameplay" name="Gameplay"></a><h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Throughout the game, the player directly controls the onscreen character from a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies. Unlike previous games in the series, the player can also control the camera with the right analog stick, allowing for a 360Â° view of the surroundings.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE12_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE12" title="">[9]</a></sup> While in towns and cities, the player may only see from the perspective of Vaan, although any character may be controlled in battle. The world of <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in previous <i>Final Fantasy</i> games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the <a href="/wiki/Overworld" id="w">world</a> by foot, by <a href="/wiki/Chocobo" id="w">Chocobo</a>,<sup id="_ref-GUIDE14_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE14" title="">[6]</a></sup> or by airship.<sup id="_ref-IGNreview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNreview" title="">[4]</a></sup> Players may save their game to a <a href="/wiki/Memory_card" id="w">memory card</a> using save crystals and may also teleport between special gate crystals.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE15_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE15" title="">[10]</a></sup> An in-game bestiary provides incidental information about the world of <i>Final Fantasy XII</i>.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE19_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE19" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Final Fantasy XII</i> largely reforms the system of earning <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_items#Currency" id="w">gil</a>, the currency of the <i>Final Fantasy</i> games. Instead of gil, most enemies drop &#34;loot&#34;, which can be sold at shops.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE288_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE288" title="">[12]</a></sup> This ties into a new battle mechanic which rewards the player with improved loot for slaying a particular type of monster multiple times in a row.<sup id="_ref-BRADY41_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY41" title="">[13]</a></sup> Selling different types of loot also unlocks a Bazaar option in shops, which provides items at a lower cost, or items exclusive to the Bazaar.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE288_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE288" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

Unlike the previous <i>Final Fantasy</i> games which used a turn-based system, battles in <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> occur in the open field, however <a href="/wiki/Menu_(computing)" id="w">menus</a> are still used to issue commands to the characters. Combat unfolds in real time, using a new system called <i><a href="/wiki/Square_Enix_battle_systems#Real Time Battle" id="w">active dimension battle</a></i> (ADB), which allows the player to battle in the <a href="/wiki/Overworld" id="w">overworld</a> instead of in a separate battle screen.<sup id="_ref-BRADY35_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY35" title="">[14]</a></sup> The player may issue commands to any of the three characters in the battle party at will or allow &#34;gambits&#34;, which issue automatic commands under certain triggers, to allow the characters to act on their own; however, certain &#34;guest&#34; characters are controlled by the game&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" id="w">AI</a>.<sup id="_ref-BRADY37_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY37" title="">[15]</a></sup> Battle commands include <i>Attack</i>, <i>Magicks &#38; Technicks</i>, <i>Mist</i>, <i>Gambits</i>, and <i>Items</i>. Using these abilities, the player must destroy enemies before being defeated.</p>
<p>&#34;<a href="/wiki/Random_encounter" id="w">Random encounters</a>&#34; have been eliminated in <i>Final Fantasy XII</i>; the transition to a separate battle screen like in other <i>Final Fantasy</i> titles is absent.<sup id="_ref-BRADY35_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY35" title="">[14]</a></sup> Instead, enemies are visible in the overworld before an engagement and the player may choose to fight or avoid them in open combat. A battle begins when the party comes within range of an aggressive enemy (or vice versa), if the party attacks a nonaggressive enemy, or if a story event initiates a confrontation.<sup id="_ref-BRADY35_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY35" title="">[14]</a></sup> When a character or enemy begins to perform an action, target lines connect characters to other party members or enemies; different colors represent the type of action.<sup id="_ref-BRADY39_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY39" title="">[16]</a></sup> The player may switch any active character with an inactive character at any time, unless the active character is targeted by an attack or ability. Characters who are knocked out may also be substituted. The absence of a transition to a battle screen meant the usual victory scene is also eliminated, though a successful &#34;<a href="/wiki/Boss_(video_games)" id="w">Boss</a>&#34; battle does present the player with a &#34;Congratulations&#34; screen and the participating characters in their victory poses.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another new feature in <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> is the &#34;gambit&#34; system, which allows the player to program each character to perform certain commands in battle in response to specified conditions.<sup id="_ref-BRADY29_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY29" title="">[18]</a></sup> Using gambits, the player may set reactions to different stimuli for each character. Each gambit consists of three parts: a target, an action, and a priority. The target specifies which ally or foe to act on and the condition for applying the action. For example, the target &#34;Ally: HP &#60; 70%&#34; causes the character to target any ally whose HP has fallen below 70%. The action is the command to be performed on the target. The priority determines which gambit to perform when multiple gambits are triggered. This rudimentary AI programming scheme allows the characters to act on their own, although player-inputted commands are always given top priority.<sup id="_ref-BRADY29_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY29" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p><div style="wigth:170px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:170px-Mateus-ffxii.jpg" title="Espers, such as Mateus, pictured, aid in battle."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/170px-Mateus-ffxii.jpg" alt="Espers, such as Mateus, pictured, aid in battle." title="Espers, such as Mateus, pictured, aid in battle." class="location-left type-thumb" width="170px" />

In <i>Final Fantasy XII</i>, a mysterious phenomenon, &#34;Mist&#34;, is the key energy which allows the player to <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_magic#Summoning Magic" id="w">cast summoning magic</a> and perform &#34;Quickenings&#34;, the game&#39;s version of <a href="/wiki/Limit_Break" id="w">Limit Breaks</a>. After defeating one in combat, the player will be able to summon an &#34;Esper&#34; to the battlefield.<sup id="_ref-BRADY44_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY44" title="">[19]</a></sup> Similar to <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X" id="w">Final Fantasy X</a></i>, the summoned creatures become active participants in battle,<sup id="_ref-BRADY44_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY44" title="">[19]</a></sup> as opposed to the cinematic attacks seen in previous games in the series. Unlike <i>Final Fantasy X</i>, however, Espers follow hidden gambits, rather than the player&#39;s direct command.<sup id="_ref-BRADY44_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY44" title="">[19]</a></sup> The summoner remains an active member in the fight, able to attack and cast support magic, instead of leaving the party or standing idle while the summoned creature fights.<sup id="_ref-BRADY44_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY44" title="">[19]</a></sup> An Esper will leave the battle if either the summoner or itself is knocked out, its time limit expires, or it executes its special attack.<sup id="_ref-BRADY44_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY44" title="">[19]</a></sup> Some Espers have origins in the two installments of the <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics" id="w">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></i> series and others are derived from the final bosses of previous <i>Final Fantasy</i> games, such as <a href="/wiki/Chaos_(Final_Fantasy)" id="w">Chaos</a> and <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Final_Fantasy_IV#Major villains" id="w">Zeromus</a>.</p>
<p><i>Final Fantasy XII</i> introduces a new <a href="/wiki/Limit_Break" id="w">Limit Break</a> system similar to those in previous games in the series: &#34;Quickenings&#34; (&#34;Mist Knacks&#34; in the Japanese version of the game).<sup id="_ref-BRADY58_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY58" title="">[20]</a></sup> Characters learn Quickenings by progressing to specific panels on the License Board.<sup id="_ref-BRADY58_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY58" title="">[20]</a></sup> Each character can learn three Quickenings, which are unique to that character.<sup id="_ref-BRADY58_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY58" title="">[20]</a></sup> Characters may string together Quickenings into large combo attacks, called Mist Chains.<sup id="_ref-BRADY58_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY58" title="">[20]</a></sup> If a Mist Chain reaches a certain number of attacks, a final strike will be initiated at the end of the Quickening cycle, called a Concurrence.<sup id="_ref-BRADY58_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY58" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<a id="License_Board" name="License_Board"></a><h3>License Board</h3>

Like most role-playing games, characters <a href="/wiki/Experience_point#Level-based progression" id="w">level up</a> each time they earn a set number of <a href="/wiki/Experience_point" id="w">experience points</a> from defeating enemies; each &#34;level&#34; gained increases the character&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Statistic_(role-playing_games)" id="w">statistics</a>, thus improving their performance in battle.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE17_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE17" title="">[21]</a></sup> Statistics include <a href="/wiki/Hit_point" id="w">hit points</a>, the amount of damage a character can receive; strength, the power of the character&#39;s physical attacks; and magic, the potency of the character&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_magic" id="w">magical spells</a>.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE17_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE17" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to leveling up, players may improve their characters via the License Board. The License Board is an oddly shaped array of panels that contain &#34;licenses&#34;â<a href="/wiki/License" id="w">permits</a> which allow a character to perform certain actions.<sup id="_ref-BRADY18_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY18" title="">[22]</a></sup> The board is split into two parts; the upper part contains Magick, Technick, Accessory, and Augment (stat-raising) licenses, and the bottom part is filled mostly with Weapon and Armor licenses.<sup id="_ref-BRADY20_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY20" title="">[23]</a></sup> To use an <a href="/wiki/Statistic_(role-playing_games)#Skills" id="w">ability</a> or piece of equipment, the character must obtain its corresponding license by spending the required amount of LP (License Points) to permit its use.<sup id="_ref-BRADY18_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRADY18" title="">[22]</a></sup> LP are earned in battle along with the experience points. Like <i>Final Fantasy X<b>s <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X#Sphere Grid" id="w">Sphere Grid</a>, all characters may obtain all licenses on the board; however, each Quickening and Esper license may only be activated by a single character.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE23_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE23" title="">[24]</a></sup></b></i></p>

<i>Final Fantasy XII</i> is set within the land of <a href="/wiki/Ivalice" id="w">Ivalice</a> during an age when &#34;magic was commonplace&#34; and &#34;airships plied the skies, crowding out the heavens&#34;. At this time, magicite, a magic-rich mineral, is commonly used in magic spells<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> and in powering airshipsâa popular form of transportation in Ivalice.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Ivalice is divided into three continents:<sup id="_ref-sleipnir_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sleipnir" title="">[27]</a></sup> Ordalia, Valendia, and Kerwon.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE12_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE12" title="">[9]</a></sup> Ordalia is located in the western part of Ivalice. The Rozarrian Empire makes its home in the vast inland plains of this continent as the eastern portion of it is largely desert or &#34;jagd&#34;âlawless lands so rich in Mist (the ethereal manifestation of magicite) that airships cannot fly over them.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Valendia is the home of Imperial Archadia, where vast and lush plains dot the landscape.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Central to the story is Dalmasca, a small kingdom between the two continents and Empires. Located in the middle of the Galtean Peninsula of Ordalia, Dalmasca is surrounded by an expanse of desert. The temperate climate of Dalmasca differs from the cold environs of Kerwon and the lush plains of Valendia and Ordalia.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> During this time, Ivalice is beset by the pending war between the forces of Rozarria and Archadia. Caught between the two powerful Empires, Dalmasca and a number of smaller nations have already been subjugated by Archadia two years before the game begins.</p>
<p>According to the game developers, design inspiration came from a mix of medieval <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea" id="w">Mediterranean</a> countries as demonstrated by the architectural styles found throughout Ivalice along with many of the races populating the region.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> The art team visited <a href="/wiki/Turkey" id="w">Turkey</a>, which influenced the gameâs Mediterranean-style setting.<sup id="_ref-Q&A_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Q&A" title="">[32]</a></sup> The developers also used styles and deco from other sources including areas in <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>.<sup id="_ref-ffshrine_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ffshrine" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Q&A_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Q&A" title="">[32]</a></sup> Of note is the use of <a href="/wiki/Sanskrit" id="w">Sanskrit</a> in the city of <a href="/wiki/Ivalice#Purvama Dorstonis" id="w">Bhujerba</a>. Phrases such as &#34;Svagatam&#34; (welcome) and titles like &#34;Parijanah&#34; (Guide) are lifted directly from Sanskrit. Hideo Minaba, a developer and co-art director with Isamu KamikokuryÅ, mentions that the team tried to bring out <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" id="w">Arabic</a> culture in the design of the game.<sup id="_ref-AkiInterview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AkiInterview" title="">[34]</a></sup> War is a predominant theme of the game and the developers confirmed that the cutscene battles are influenced by <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">Ancient Rome</a>.<sup id="_ref-ffshrine_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ffshrine" title="">[33]</a></sup> When asked to comment on the fan observation of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" id="w">Star Wars</a></i> influence, Minaba assured that although he was a fan of the <i>Star Wars</i> series, it was not necessarily an influence to the game&#39;s designs.<sup id="_ref-Q&A_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Q&A" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Final Fantasy XII</i>  begins in Dalmasca&#39;s capital city of Rabanastre, where the happiness from the union of Princess Ashe of Dalmasca and Prince Rasler of Nabradia is interrupted by the Archadian Empire&#39;s invasion of Dalmasca. In the subsequent war, Nabradia and Dalmasca are subjugated by Archadia; among the lives lost is Prince Rasler. The Dalmascan king, Raminas, who is forced to sign a treaty of surrender, is slated to be assassinated.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> A rescue attempt by Dalmascan knights backfires when Basch, one of the leading knights, kills Raminas and Reks, a young 17-year old knight who was with the knights during the attempt. The treason of Basch, and Ashe&#39;s eventual suicide, are announced by Marquis Ondore.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Two years later, Vaan, Reks&#39;s younger brother, infiltrates the Rabanastre palace during the dinner to celebrate the appointment of Vayne as Consul, despite Penelo&#39;s objection. During the infiltration, Vaan encounters Balthier and Fran, who introduce him to magicite. Their escape attempt backfires when Resistance forces storm the palace, landing them into the sewers where they stumble upon the Resistance leader, Amalia. However, Vaan, Balthier and Fran are captured by the Archadians and detained at the Nalbina Dungeons. In Nalbina, the trio encounters Basch and learns of the existence of his twin, Judge Magister Gabranth, and eventually escape with him. Basch conveys to Vaan that Gabranth had posed as him to blackmail Ondore.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> While skeptical at first, Vaan finally believes him,<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> and helps Basch reach Bhujerba with the help of Balthier and Fran. They also learn of Penelo&#39;s kidnapping by headhunter Ba&#39;Gamnan, who uses her to lure Balthier to him. This brings them to a meeting in Bhujerba with Lamont, a curious boy who is in truth Vayne&#39;s younger brother, Larsa.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> Basch is also able to confront the Marquis, who captures the party to be sent onboard the Archadian airship, Leviathan, headed by Judge Ghis. Ghis takes Vaan&#39;s magicite - the Dusk Shard - to be sent to Archadia.</p>
<p>On the Leviathan, the party is reunited with Amalia, revealed to be Princess Ashe;<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> and Penelo, who had been rescued by Larsa. Escaping the airship and unable to convince the Marquis to prove her royal lineage,<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> Ashe, driven by visions of Rasler, attempts to collect the Dynast-King Raithwall&#39;s treasures to prove her royal blood.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> The Dawn Shard, a form of magicite called deifacted Nethicite obtained from Raithwall&#39;s Tomb and seized by Ghis, proves to be fatal as the small stone destroys the Leviathan, Ghis, and his fleet. Now unable to use the Shard, Larsa convinces Ashe to seek Gran Kiltias Anastasis, who lives in Mt. Bur-Omisace, for his approval of her as queen of Dalmasca.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> Vaan and Penelo travel with the entourage, which includes Basch, Balthier, and Fran. On the way, the party rescues Fran&#39;s sister, Mjrn, who was possessed by manufacted (artificial) Nethicite in the process.</p>
<p>The party learns in Mt. Bur-Omisace that not all parties are wishing for war.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> Larsa, who had been investigating Vayne&#39;s connection with the manufacted Nethicite,<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> had made contact with Al-Cid Margrace, a member of the Rozarrian Empire ruling family, to convince the two Empires to cease their war. Their plan to announce Ashe&#39;s status as Dalmascan Queen and to persuade Gramis for peace was forestalled with the Emperor&#39;s death at the supposed hands of the Archadian Senate Chairman, Gregoroth.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> With Anastasis&#39; aid, Ashe retrieves the Sword of Kings, which can destroy Nethicite. While she obtains the sword, Anastasis is killed by Judge Bergan and Larsa is brought back to Archadia. After defeating Judge Bergan, Ashe&#39;s party travels to Archades and the Draklor Laboratory, where manufacted Nethicite were made by Dr. Cid&#39;s research. There, they encounter Reddas; however, Dr. Cid escapes and leaves clues that lead them to Giruvegan,<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> the supposed location of the Sun-Cryst, the source of deifacted Nethicite.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> While together able to enter Giruvegan, Ashe alone encounters the makers of the Sun-Cryst, the Occuria, receiving the real location of the Sun-Cryst, and the Treaty Blade to cut her own piece of deifacted Nethicite.<sup id="_ref-occuria1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-occuria1" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Archadian Empire&#39;s might, led by Vayne, was due to Dr. Cid&#39;s Nethicite research and the assistance of the Occuria betrayer, Venat.<sup id="_ref-occuria2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-occuria2" title="">[56]</a></sup> Vayne aims to become the new Dynast-King by using manufacted Nethicite to conquer all of Ivalice.<sup id="_ref-judge1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-judge1" title="">[57]</a></sup> Dr. Cid, revealed to be Balthier&#39;s father, was obsessed with researching the Nethicite&#39;s power after his own visit to Giruvegan and initial encounter with Venat.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> Their expansion campaign which led to the Nabudis&#39; destruction and Dalmasca&#39;s occupation was made to obtain and study the royal heirlooms - deifacted Nethicite.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> Gabranth was sent to Giruvegan to ascertain Ashe&#39;s intentions for war. With the Occuria&#39;s clue to the Sun-Cryst, Ashe travels to the Pharos at Ridorana Cataract, accompanied by Reddas. Finding the Sun-Cryst atop the tower, Ashe resolves to destroy the Sun-Cryst,<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> defeating Gabranth, who admits to killing her father in an attempt to force her to give in to her hate.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> By then, Cid arrives to chide Gabranth before disposing of him and evoking the full-power of the Sun-Cryst with the Nethicite shards prior to his death. Reddas, intent not to allow history repeat itself like at Nabudis, sacrifices himself to destroy it using the Sword of Kings.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ashe learns from Al-Cid that an impending war between Archadia and the Resistance group led by Marquis Ondore, who defied the Empire after the Leviathan incident,<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> is about to take place in Rabanastre. The party travels home to find Archadian forces strengthened with the Sky Fortress Bahamut - an enormous, nethicite-fuelled airship armed with incredibly powerful weapons. Infiltrating the sky fortress with the aid of the Resistance, Basch confronts Gabranth, who spews hate towards his twin, yet taken by Basch&#39;s loyalty.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> The party encounters Vayne and Larsa, the latter objecting to Vayne&#39;s plot for power;<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> Larsa and Gabranth ally with the party to destroy Vayne after Venat infused its power into him.

Balthier and Fran remain onboard the Bahamut, steering it away from Rabanastre to prevent a collision, though contact with them was lost.</p>
<p>One year later, Ashe has become Queen of Dalmasca and her coronation is about to take place in one month&#39;s time; Basch replaces Gabranth as Judge Magister due to the latter&#39;s request,<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> serving as guardian to Larsa, now Emperor of Archadia. The story ends with Vaan flying his own airship with Penelo after Balthier and Fran return to &#39;steal&#39; the Strahl. They leave Vaan a message which includes a note to Queen Ashe and also her ring that Balthier took from her earlier in the story, this is then delivered to Ashe. Following this, Vaan and Penelo set out in an airship to visit Balthier and Fran in <a href="/wiki/Ivalice#Final Fantasy Tactics" id="w">Bervenia</a>.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup></p>

The desire to move away from <a href="/wiki/Random_encounter" id="w">random encounters</a> was present since the beginning of development.<sup id="_ref-itointerview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-itointerview" title="">[75]</a></sup> This desire fueled the transition to the &#34;active dimension battle&#34; system so players could seamlessly move from battle to exploration. The gambit system was conceived early on as a way to facilitate this transition.<sup id="_ref-itointerview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-itointerview" title="">[75]</a></sup> Battle system designer Hiroshi Tomomatsu states that it gradually moved away from a complex and rigid formula to the more flexible form seen in the final version of the game.<sup id="_ref-tomomatsu_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tomomatsu" title="">[76]</a></sup> ItÅ drew inspiration for gambits from <a href="/wiki/Play_from_scrimmage" id="w">plays</a> in <a href="/wiki/American_football" id="w">American football</a> where each team member has a specific job to do based on the conditions and desired outcome.

<p>At the early stages of development, Minagawa revealed that numerous ideas and features were planned for the game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included the ability for a second player to join in the gameplay, enabling for a two-player mode. Another idea that was given a considerable amount of thought was the ability to recruit non-player characters to join in the mob hunts. Due to the physical limitations of the console and multiple number of characters joining the fray, the development phase took longer than expected, causing delays.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup></p>
