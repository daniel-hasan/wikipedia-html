<p>During the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812" id="w">War of 1812</a>, Spencer served in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" id="w">United States Army</a> where he was appointed <a href="/wiki/Brigade" id="w">brigade</a> <a href="/wiki/Judge_Advocate_General%26%2339%3Bs_Corps%2C_U.S._Army" id="w">judge advocate general</a> for the northern frontier.

Instead of seeking renomination in 1818, Spencer was a candidate for the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" id="w">United States Senate</a>, but lost to <a href="/wiki/Rufus_King" id="w">Rufus King</a>. He was a member of the committee that reported unfavorably on the affairs of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States" id="w">Second Bank of the United States</a>, was a member of the <a href="/wiki/New_York_State_Assembly" id="w">New York Assembly</a> from 1820 to 1822, serving as <a href="/wiki/Speaker_of_the_New_York_State_Assembly" id="w">Speaker</a> in 1820. He was a member of the <a href="/wiki/New_York_State_Senate" id="w">New York Senate</a> from 1824 to 1828.</p>
<p>In 1826, Spencer served as a <a href="/wiki/Special_prosecutor" id="w">special prosecutor</a> to investigate the disappearance of <a href="/wiki/William_Morgan_(anti-Mason)" id="w">William Morgan</a> who was arrested, <a href="/wiki/Kidnapping" id="w">kidnapped</a> and murdered for exposing secrets kept by <a href="/wiki/Freemasonry" id="w">Freemasons</a>, thus sparking the <a href="/wiki/Anti-Masonic_Party" id="w">Anti-Masonic movement</a>. Spencer sided with the anti-Masons and was the author of a manuscript on <a href="/wiki/Freemasonry#Ritual, symbolism, and morality" id="w">Masonic rituals</a>. He was again a member of the New York Assembly from 1831 to 1833 and moved to <a href="/wiki/Albany%2C_New_York" id="w">Albany, New York</a> in 1837.

<a id="Federal_government" name="Federal_government"></a><h1>Federal government</h1>
<p>In 1841, <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Tyler" id="w">John Tyler</a> appointed Spencer to be <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War" id="w">Secretary of War</a> in his administration. As War Secretary, he proposed a chain of posts extending from <a href="/wiki/Council_Bluffs%2C_Iowa" id="w">Council Bluffs, Iowa</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Columbia_River" id="w">Columbia River</a>, urged that the government adhere to field commander arrangements by compensating the <a href="/wiki/Creek_people" id="w">Creek Indians</a> who were removed from the area. In 1842, his nineteen-year-old son, <a href="/wiki/Philip_Spencer" id="w">Philip Spencer</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Midshipman" id="w">midshipman</a>, was executed without <a href="/wiki/Court-martial" id="w">court-martial</a> along with two other sailors aboard the brig <a href="/wiki/USS_Somers_(1842)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Somers&#39;&#39;</a> for allegedly attempting <a href="/wiki/Mutiny" id="w">mutiny</a>. </p>
<p>In 1843, Spencer was appointed <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury" id="w">Secretary of the Treasury</a> after the resignation of <a href="/wiki/Walter_Forward" id="w">Walter Forward</a>. As Treasury Secretary, he was preoccupied with the <a href="/wiki/Tariff_in_American_history" id="w">tariff</a> and believed that the deficit and other federal expenditures should be funded by duties on imports rather than by internal taxation, something he was forced to announce for the <a href="/wiki/Fiscal_year" id="w">fiscal year</a> in 1843. The expenditures of the treasury had exceeded its receipts and he advocated additional import duties on certain articles such as <a href="/wiki/Coffee" id="w">coffee</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tea" id="w">tea</a>. He also continued to develop a plan, originally initiated by Forward, for a Board of <a href="/wiki/Exchequer" id="w">Exchequer</a> to keep and disburse public funds raised by duties. The Exchequer bill, which reflected the federal government&#39;s continuing interest in some form of independent treasury system, failed due to a political conflict in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" id="w">United States Congress</a>.</p>
<p>President Tyler had nominated Spencer to be an <a href="/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" id="w">Associate Justice</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court" id="w">United States Supreme Court</a> twice, first in <a href="/wiki/January" id="w">January</a> of 1844 to fill <a href="/wiki/Smith_Thompson" id="w">Smith Thompson</a>&#39;s seat and again in <a href="/wiki/June" id="w">June</a> of the same year to fill <a href="/wiki/Henry_Baldwin_(judge)" id="w">Henry Baldwin</a>&#39;s seat, but the Senate failed to confirm him both times. As one of few northerners in an administration dominated by southern interests, Spencer found it increasingly difficult to serve in his cabinet post and resigned as Treasury Secretary in <a href="/wiki/May" id="w">May</a> of 1844. He returned to Albany where he died on <a href="/wiki/May_18" id="w">May 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1855" id="w">1855</a>. He was interned in <a href="/wiki/Albany_Rural_Cemetery" id="w">Albany Rural Cemetery</a> beside his wife, Elizabeth.</p>
