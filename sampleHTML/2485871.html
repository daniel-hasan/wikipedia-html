<p><b>Cindy Lee Miller Sheehan</b> (born <a href="/wiki/July_10" id="w">July 10</a> <a href="/wiki/1957" id="w">1957</a>) is an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> anti-war <a href="/wiki/Activist" id="w">activist</a>, whose son, <a href="/wiki/Casey_Sheehan" id="w">Casey Sheehan</a>, was killed during his service in the <a href="/wiki/Iraq_War" id="w">Iraq War</a> on <a href="/wiki/April_4" id="w">April 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>.

Sheehan states she initially questioned the urgency of the <a href="/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq" id="w">invasion of Iraq</a>, but did not become active in the anti-war effort until after her son&#39;s death.<sup id="_ref-buzzflash410_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-buzzflash410" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sheehan and other military families met with <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">President George W.

In a <a href="/wiki/June_24" id="w">June 24</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a> interview with the Vacaville <i>Reporter</i> published soon after the meeting, she stated, &#34;We haven&#39;t been happy with the way the war has been handled. The President has changed his reasons for being over there every time a reason is proven false or an objective reached.&#34; She also stated that President Bush was &#34;... sincere about wanting freedom for the Iraqis… I know he&#39;s sorry and feels some pain for our loss. And I know he&#39;s a man of faith.&#34;<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sheehan gave another interview on <a href="/wiki/October_4" id="w">October 4</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, stating that she did not understand the reasons for the Iraq invasion and never thought that <a href="/wiki/Iraq" id="w">Iraq</a> posed an imminent threat to the United States.

<p>During the Presidential Inauguration in January 2005, Sheehan traveled to Washington, D.C. to speak at the opening of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Eyes_Wide_Open:_the_Human_Cost_of_War" id="w">Eyes Wide Open: the Human Cost of War</a>&#34;, a traveling exhibition created by the <a href="/wiki/American_Friends_Service_Committee" id="w">American Friends Service Committee</a> that displays pairs of combat boots to represent every U.S. military casualty. There she met others who lost family members in Iraq, and together they planned to create an organization for similar families. Sheehan wrote about the experience in a commentary article.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> She was also a featured speaker when the exhibition opened in San Diego in March 2005<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> and traveled with the exhibition to other locations. &#34;Behind these boots is one broken-hearted family,&#34; she stated as she donated her son Casey&#39;s boots to travel with Eyes Wide Open when it stopped in San Francisco later that month.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sheehan is one of the nine founding members of <a href="/wiki/Gold_Star_Families_for_Peace" id="w">Gold Star Families for Peace</a>, an organization created in January 2005 that seeks to end the U.S. presence in Iraq and provide support for families of fallen soldiers.

Toward the end of her <a href="/wiki/Vigil" id="w">vigil</a>, she said she was &#34;very, very, very grateful&#34; Bush did not grant her that meeting because it would have ended the momentum the <a href="/wiki/Peace_movement" id="w">peace movement</a> gained from the popularity of her demonstrations.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>In March 2005, James Morris sent an e-mail to <a href="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" id="w">ABC</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Nightline" id="w">Nightline</a></i> allegedly written by Sheehan that included the statements that Casey Sheehan &#34;was killed for lies and for a <a href="/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century" id="w">PNAC</a> <a href="/wiki/Neoconservativism" id="w">Neo-Con</a> agenda to benefit <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israel</a>&#34; and that he had &#34;joined the Army to protect America, not Israel.&#34; Sheehan denies the allegations: &#34;I&#39;ve never said that... Those aren&#39;t even words that I would say. I do believe that the <a href="/wiki/Palestinian" id="w">Palestinian</a> issue<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> is a hot issue that needs to be solved, and it needs to be more fair and equitable, but I never said my son died for Israel.&#34; She claims that Morris modified the email to support his own personal agenda. Morris denies altering the email before sending it along to <i>Nightline</i><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> on Sheehan&#39;s behalf (per her request for him to do so). Two other individuals, Tony Tersch and Skeeter Gallagher, received a copy of Sheehan&#39;s email directly from her; both claim that the e-mail they received is consistent with Morris&#39; story, rather than Sheehan&#39;s.

On <a href="/wiki/August_6" id="w">August 6</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, Sheehan created a makeshift camp in a ditch by the side of the road about three miles from George W.

<p>Gold Star Families for Peace, of which Sheehan is a founding member, released a TV commercial featuring Sheehan, broadcast on Crawford and <a href="/wiki/Waco%2C_Texas" id="w">Waco</a> cable channels near Bush&#39;s ranch.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> The group conducted a walk to a police station just outside Bush&#39;s Crawford ranch and delivered a bundle of oversized letters written by them to First Lady <a href="/wiki/Laura_Bush" id="w">Laura Bush</a>, appealing to her as a mother for support towards their movement.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

On the show, she called Bush &#34;the biggest terrorist in the world&#34; and &#34;worse than <a href="/wiki/Osama_Bin_Laden" id="w">Osama Bin Laden</a>,&#34; and conceded that she would rather live under Venezuela&#39;s Chávez than Bush.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup>  Later that month, Sheehan purchased five acres of land in Crawford, Texas, near Bush&#39;s private residence. In a written statement, Sheehan wrote that she &#34;decided to buy property in Crawford to use until George&#39;s resignation or <a href="/wiki/Impeachment" id="w">impeachment</a>, which we all hope is soon for the sake of the world.&#34; She also stated that she &#34;can&#39;t think of a better way to use Casey&#39;s insurance money than for peace&#34;, and that she is sure that Casey would have approved.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> In an interview on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Stephanie_Miller_Show" id="w">The Stephanie Miller Show</a></i>, Sheehan said that once her need for the land is over, she intends to donate the land to Crawford for the purpose of converting it into The Casey Sheehan Memorial Peace Park.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
<p>In September, Sheehan released her memoir, entitled <i>Peace Mom: A Mother&#39;s Journey Through Heartache to Activism</i>. The book recounts her experience of losing her son, along with <a href="/wiki/Fantasy_(psychology)" id="w">fantasies</a> of <a href="/wiki/Suicide" id="w">suicide</a> and revenge against Bush, and her transformation into an anti-war activist. Also included in the book are criticisms several other politicians, including: Senator John McCain, whom she accuses of lying to the media about his private statements to her; <a href="/wiki/John_Kerry" id="w">John Kerry</a>, whom she says she regrets voting for; and Hillary Clinton, whom she calls a &#34;powermonger.&#34;<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>

I have never seen anything like it in the world; it doesn’t matter what part of the world we come from, or the fact that our governments don’t get along, we have the same hearts and they are filled with love.&#34;<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>

Some students let their opinion be known as Sheehan had a hard time speaking over the chorus of boos from those in attendance. At one point in her speech, she referred to the students heckling her as &#34;warmongers.&#34;<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
