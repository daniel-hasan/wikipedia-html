It recently published its 100th issue.</p>

<a id="Beginnings" name="Beginnings"></a><h1>Beginnings</h1>
<p><i>Classic Rock</i> was an idea formulated by ex-<i>Metal Hammer</i> Deputy Editor Jerry Ewing (subsequently Editor of <i>Classic Rock</i>), along with <i>Metal Hammer</i> colleague Dave Ling and art editor Andy Ryan at Dennis Publishing. They suggested a one-off title dedicated to classic rock. They felt it was neglected in publication and would attract a large audience. In 1998 original publishers Dennis Publishing allegedly begrudgingly authorised the first issue of <i>Classic Rock</i> featuring <a href="/wiki/Guns_N%26%2339%3B_Roses" id="w">Guns N&#39; Roses</a> and including an article by <a href="/wiki/Mick_Wall" id="w">Mick Wall</a>, a journalist who became something of a renowned name when <a href="/wiki/Axl_Rose" id="w">Axl Rose</a> insulted him on the track &#34;<a href="/wiki/Get_in_the_Ring" id="w">Get in the Ring</a>&#34; on <i><a href="/wiki/Use_Your_Illusion_II" id="w">Use Your Illusion II</a></i>. It sold better than expected and was continued. Wall is one of six writers, along with Ewing and Ling who where involved in that publication and still write for the magazine today. The magazine attracted a niche audience initially but sales grew as <i>Classic Rock</i> featured artists such as <a href="/wiki/Black_Sabbath" id="w">Black Sabbath</a>. <a href="/wiki/Iron_Maiden" id="w">Iron Maiden</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aerosmith" id="w">Aerosmith</a> on its cover in the first year. It attracted those who saw mainstream music publications such as <i><a href="/wiki/Q_(magazine)" id="w">Q</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/NME" id="w">NME</a></i> to be stale, and too focused on discovering the &#34;next big thing&#34;. It also came at a time when the charts were even more dominated by pop bands than usual, as record companies seemed unwilling to risk money on bands who wrote their own material. <i>Classic Rock</i> soon became a regular fixture in newsagents the UK, Ireland and Europe, and now publishes 13 issues a year.</p>
<a id="Key_Acts" name="Key_Acts"></a><h1>Key Acts</h1>
<p>The magazine focuses on established bands with credentials dating back to the 1960&#39;s.

<a id="100th_Issue" name="100th_Issue"></a><h1>100th Issue</h1>
<p>The 100th issue, quite a landmark considering the haphazard nature of the magazine&#39;s origin, contained all the regular features, but only one article, in which 100 names in rock were asked to write a piece on their nomination for a &#34;rock icon&#34;. Contributors included such notable figures as <a href="/wiki/Brian_May" id="w">Brian May</a>, Lemmy (who nominated <a href="/wiki/Tina_Turner" id="w">Tina Turner</a>, who was then himself nominated by Ian Camfield) <a href="/wiki/Ian_Gillan" id="w">Ian Gillan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gary_Moore" id="w">Gary Moore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phil_Collins" id="w">Phil Collins</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sebastian_Bach" id="w">Sebastian Bach</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Frampton" id="w">Peter Frampton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Cantrell" id="w">Jerry Cantrell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chris_Cornell" id="w">Chris Cornell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Rodgers" id="w">Paul Rodgers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chad_Smith" id="w">Chad Smith</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jack_Black" id="w">Jack Black</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zakk_Wylde" id="w">Zakk Wylde</a> and <a href="/wiki/Matt_Bellamy" id="w">Matt Bellamy</a>.</p>
<a id="Special_Issues" name="Special_Issues"></a><h1>Special Issues</h1>
<p><i>Classic Rock</i> has also published, in conjunction with <i>Metal Hammer</i>, special decade issues featuring 70s (Issue I), 80s (Issue II), and 90s (Issue III) hard rock and metal bands, throughout 2006. In 2007, three special editions were also published with bonus DVDs for £7.50. These each focussed on one genre of rock music - first blues rock (Issue I), then progressive rock (Issue II), and finally, heavy metal (Issue III). A special 2007 collectors edition <i>bookazine</i> was produced entitled &#34;High Voltage&#34;, featuring stories by Mick Wall and photographs by <a href="/wiki/Ross_Halfin" id="w">Ross Halfin</a> on Jimmy Page, Ozzy Osbourne, Axl Rose et al.
