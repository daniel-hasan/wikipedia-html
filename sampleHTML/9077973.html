<p>The <b>Ogle County Courthouse</b> is a <a href="/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places" id="w">Registered Historic Place</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Ogle_County%2C_Illinois" id="w">Ogle County, Illinois</a> county seat of <a href="/wiki/Oregon%2C_Illinois" id="w">Oregon</a>. The building stands on a public square in the city&#39;s downtown commercial district. The current structure was completed in 1891 and was preceded by two other buildings, one of which was destroyed by a group of outlaws. Following the destruction of the courthouse, the county was without a judicial building for a period during the 1840s. The Ogle County Courthouse was designed by Chicago architect <a href="/wiki/George_O._Garnsey" id="w">George O. Garnsey</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture" id="w">Romanesque Revival</a> style of architecture. The ridged roof is dominated by its wooden <a href="/wiki/Cupola" id="w">cupola</a> which stands out at a distance. </p>
<p>In addition to the <a href="/wiki/Courthouse" id="w">courthouse</a> building, the public square contains several outbuildings and sites that are also historic in nature and considered <a href="/wiki/Contributing_properties" id="w">contributing properties</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Oregon_Commercial_Historic_District" id="w">Oregon Commercial Historic District</a>, including a sculpture by <a href="/wiki/Lorado_Taft" id="w">Lorado Taft</a> and a cast-iron fountain. The courthouse joined the Register in 1981 and was included as a contributing property to the <a href="/wiki/Historic_district" id="w">historic district</a> in 2006. After initially joining the Register the structure underwent a careful restoration. The courthouse no longer serves as the primary judiciary center for the county; its successor is located directly across the street.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<p>Ogle County Courthouse has been the name of three buildings.  The current structure on the public square, no longer in use as the judiciary center in Ogle County, was constructed in late 1890 and early 1891 at a cost of <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$107</a>,000.<sup id="_ref-or_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-or" title="">[1]</a></sup> The basically square Romanesque Revival structure is topped with a <a href="/wiki/Cupola" id="w">cupola</a> and features a full basement. It was designed by Chicago architect <a href="/wiki/George_O._Garnsey" id="w">George O. Garnsey</a>.<sup id="_ref-nrhp2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

The first session of the Ogle County Commissioners&#39; Court took place on <a href="/wiki/January_3" id="w">January 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/1837" id="w">1837</a>, after the city of Oregon was picked as the county seat.<sup id="_ref-ogle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ogle" title="">[3]</a></sup> The first courthouse was completed in 1840-1841, but it never saw use.<sup id="_ref-nrhp2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The 1840-41 courthouse was constructed at a cost of $4,000, partially in response to &#34;a gang of <a href="/wiki/Villain" id="w">villains</a>&#34; harassing citizens. On <a href="/wiki/March_21" id="w">March 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1841" id="w">1841</a>, the night before court convened in its new building, the bandits allegedly set the courthouse on fire, completely destroying it. The town, whipped into a fury by horse whipping and thievery and, even murder, later formed a band of &#34;Regulators&#34; to hunt down and bring the <a href="/wiki/Bandit" id="w">bandits</a> to justice. Essentially <a href="/wiki/Vigilante" id="w">vigilantes</a>, the group tracked down two residents, &#34;Old Man Driscoll&#34; (possibly Driskell) and his son, William Driscoll, both suspected of the murder. The Driscolls were arrested and brought to Oregon by the Regulators. A trial was organized at a nearby mill. The defendants were provided with counsel and the trial ensued, which residents involved called &#34;fair&#34; at the time.<sup id="_ref-nrhp_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The swift outcome of the trial resulted in the almost immediate execution of the two men. One Driscoll, led out alone, was shot first. Then the other was led out, shown his dead relative&#39;s body and pushed for a confession. The defendant refused to confess, though he reportedly said he had committed other crimes for which he deserved death, and was also shot.<sup id="_ref-nrhp_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/Lynching" id="w">lynching</a> friends and relatives of the Driscolls attempted to strike back at the Regulators. They obtained an <a href="/wiki/Indictment" id="w">indictment</a> against many of the Regulators charging them with murder. The Regulators responded by obtaining their own Bills of Indictment against every person who had stood by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under indictment no witnesses could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges.<sup id="_ref-nrhp_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Second_courthouse" name="Second_courthouse"></a><h2>Second courthouse</h2>
<p>The replacement for the first courthouse, destroyed by <a href="/wiki/Arson" id="w">arson</a>, was not completed until the summer of 1848. A one-story <a href="/wiki/Brick" id="w">brick</a> building, the second Ogle County Courthouse was constructed for $3,000.<sup id="_ref-nrhp_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp" title="">[4]</a></sup> The county used it for several decades but it was soon outgrown as various county offices began to accumulate more and more records and files.<sup id="_ref-nrhp2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  The structure exhibited <a href="/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture" id="w">Greek Revival</a> style, common at the time. Some of the 1848 building&#39;s architectural elements included, a vent cupola, double-hung <a href="/wiki/Sash" id="w">sash</a> <a href="/wiki/Window" id="w">windows</a>, complete with <a href="/wiki/Window_shutter" id="w">shutters</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Gable" id="w">gabled</a> front roof and <a href="/wiki/Cornice" id="w">corniced</a> returns. The new building was used as a multi-purpose public building; besides being the courthouse it served as the meeting hall for the <a href="/wiki/Evangelical_Lutheran" id="w">Evangelical Lutheran</a> Congregation of Oregon until 1850. When community leader Henry Mix died in 1867 citizens gathered at the courthouse to mourn. Though the 1848 Ogle County Courthouse was soon found to be &#34;inadequate in every respect&#34;<sup id="_ref-nrhp2_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp2" title="">[2]</a></sup> it would be over 40 years before a new facility was built. The idea of a new courthouse was met with staunch opposition and it was not until 1891 that the 1848 building was demolished and the current building erected.<sup id="_ref-nrhp2_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Third_courthouse" name="Third_courthouse"></a><h2>Third courthouse</h2>
<p>The current &#34;old&#34; courthouse in Ogle County was completed in 1891 and has been in constant use since. It was dedicated on <a href="/wiki/August_20" id="w">August 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1891" id="w">1891</a> and remained the county&#39;s primary judicial building until the same date 114 years later, in 2005.

<a id="Exterior" name="Exterior"></a><h2>Exterior</h2>
<p>The building is constructed of red pressed brick, detailed with locally quarried limestone, and reinforced with steel girders. The building&#39;s primary contractor was C.A. Moses.<sup id="_ref-nrhp2_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-nrhp_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp" title="">[4]</a></sup>
The red brick facade is detailed with significant amounts of limestone, including in its continuous <a href="/wiki/Lintel" id="w">lintels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sill" id="w">sills</a>. The entrances are covered with large round <a href="/wiki/Arch" id="w">arches</a>.

<p>The roof is sharply angled toward its center, where a wooden cupola tops the building. It was completed after the building, in 1892. At each of the square shaped building&#39;s four corners are <a href="/wiki/Dormer" id="w">dormers</a>, which serve to break up the monotony of the otherwise ridged roof. The dormers resemble the cupola, in that they are dormered as well as multi-<a href="/wiki/Gable" id="w">gabled</a>. The roof has had routine maintenance performed as required. The building&#39;s dominant feature, its cupola, sits on an oversized brick base with a <a href="/wiki/Terra_cotta" id="w">terra cotta</a> belt around its base top. It features blocked openings with multiple arches, double round arches, <a href="/wiki/Corinthian_order" id="w">Corinthian</a> <a href="/wiki/Pilaster" id="w">pilasters</a>, and organic corner detailing.<sup id="_ref-nrhp_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-nrhp2_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The courthouse is elaborately windowed. Some <a href="/wiki/Window" id="w">windows</a>, mostly on the first floor are straight topped. On the second floor most of the windows are topped with limestone arches. The original, wood-framed windows were replaced in 1972.
