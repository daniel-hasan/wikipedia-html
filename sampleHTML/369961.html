<b>Smedley Darlington Butler</b> (<a href="/wiki/July_30" id="w">July 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1881" id="w">1881</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/June_21" id="w">June 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1940" id="w">1940</a>), <a href="/wiki/Nickname" id="w">nicknamed</a> &#34;<b>The Fighting Quaker</b>&#34; and &#34;<b>Old Gimlet Eye</b>,&#34; was a <a href="/wiki/Major_General" id="w">Major General</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" id="w">U.S. Marine Corps</a> and, at the time of his death, the most decorated Marine in <a href="/wiki/U.S._history" id="w">U.S. history</a>. </p>
<p>During his 34 years of Marine Corps service, Butler was awarded numerous medals for heroism including the <a href="/wiki/Marine_Corps_Brevet_Medal" id="w">Marine Corps Brevet Medal</a> (the highest Marine medal at its time for officers), and subsequently the <a href="/wiki/Medal_of_Honor" id="w">Medal of Honor</a> twice.  Notably, he is one of only 19 people to be twice awarded the Medal of Honor, and one of only three to be awarded a Marine Corps Brevet Medal and a Medal of Honor, and the only person to be awarded a Marine Corps Brevet Medal and a Medal of Honor for two different actions.</p>
<p>In addition to his military career, Smedley Butler was noted for his outspoken anti-<a href="/wiki/Intervention" id="w">interventionist</a> views, and his book <i><a href="/wiki/War_is_a_Racket" id="w">War is a Racket</a></i>.  His book was one of the first works describing the workings of the <a href="/wiki/Military-industrial_complex" id="w">military-industrial complex</a> and after retiring from service, he became a popular speaker at meetings organized by <a href="/wiki/Veterans" id="w">veterans</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pacifism" id="w">pacifists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peace_church" id="w">church groups</a> in the 1930s.</p>
<p>In 1934, he informed the <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_the_United_States" id="w">United States Congress</a> that a group of <a href="/wiki/Business_Plot" id="w">wealthy industrialists had plotted</a> a <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%26%2339%3B%C3%A9tat" id="w">military coup</a> to overthrow the government of President <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" id="w">Franklin D.

<a id="Early_life_and_family" name="Early_life_and_family"></a><h2>Early life and family</h2>
<p>Butler was born in <a href="/wiki/West_Chester%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">West Chester</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a>,<sup id="_ref-nndb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nndb" title="">[1]</a></sup> the oldest in a family of three sons. His parents were <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Stalker_Butler" id="w">Thomas Stalker Butler</a> and Maud (Darlington) Butler,<sup id="_ref-nndb_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nndb" title="">[1]</a></sup> both members of distinguished <a href="/wiki/Quaker" id="w">Quaker</a> families. His father was a lawyer, judge, and, for 31 years, a Congressman. During his time in Congress, Thomas S. Butler was chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee during the <a href="/wiki/Warren_G._Harding" id="w">Harding</a> and <a href="/wiki/Calvin_Coolidge" id="w">Coolidge</a> administrations.<sup id="_ref-WhosWho_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WhosWho" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Butler was educated at the <a href="/wiki/Westtown_School" id="w">West Chester Friends Graded High School</a> and later at <a href="/wiki/The_Haverford_School" id="w">The Haverford School</a>, a secondary school for sons of upper-class Quaker families near Philadelphia,<sup id="_ref-Haverford_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haverford" title="">[3]</a></sup> but he dropped out to join the Marines, 38 days before his 17th birthday.<sup id="_ref-Haverford2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haverford2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Butler was married in 1905 to Ethel C. Peters, of Philadelphia. They had a daughter, Ethel Peters, and two sons, Smedley Darlington Jr. and Thomas Richard.{{ref}}  He was then posted to garrison duty in the Philippines.  Even in garrison, he managed to distinguish himself, launching a resupply mission across the stormy waters of <a href="/wiki/Subic_Bay" id="w">Subic Bay</a> after his isolated outpost ran out of rations.  He was eventually diagnosed with &#34;nervous breakdown&#34; in 1908 and he was given 9 months sick leave.  He returned home and spent a successful time in the <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia" id="w">West Virginia</a> coal mining business.  Despite an offer of permanent employment from the owners, he returned to the Corps.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Military_career" name="Military_career"></a><h2>Military career</h2>
<p>Despite his father&#39;s desire that he remain in school, Smedley Butler dropped out when the United States declared <a href="/wiki/Spanish-American_war" id="w">war against Spain</a> in 1898.  Due to his young age (he was only 16 years old) Butler lied about how old he was in order to secure a commission in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" id="w">Marines</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Second_lieutenant" id="w">second lieutenant</a>.<sup id="_ref-MCLegacyMuseum_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MCLegacyMuseum" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>After three weeks of basic training, Second Lieutenant Butler was sent to <a href="/wiki/Guant%C3%A1namo_Bay%2C_Cuba" id="w">Guantanamo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>, in July 1898,  although he saw no action there because the bay was already secured.<sup id="_ref-book_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-book" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_Boxer_Rebellion" name="The_Boxer_Rebellion"></a><h3>The Boxer Rebellion</h3>
<p>{{see main}}
Butler was twice wounded during the <a href="/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion" id="w">Boxer Rebellion</a> once in Tientsin and once in San Tan Pating. During the Battle of <a href="/wiki/Tientsin" id="w">Tientsin</a> on <a href="/wiki/July_13" id="w">July 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1900" id="w">1900</a>, Butler climbed out of a trench to retrieve a wounded officer for medical attention, whereupon he was shot in the thigh. Another Marine helped the wounded Butler to safety but was himself shot; Butler continued to assist the first man to the rear. Four enlisted men received the Medal of Honor for their actions in the battle.  Although officers were not eligible to receive the Medal of Honor, Butler received the <a href="/wiki/Marine_Corps_Brevet_Medal" id="w">Marine Corps Brevet Medal</a> and commissioned a captain by <a href="/wiki/Brevet" id="w">brevet</a>, in recognition of his bravery in the incident. Butler received his promotion while in the hospital recovering, two weeks before his nineteenth birthday. In addition to wounds he received in Tientsin, Butler was also shot in the chest at San Tan Pating.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1903, Butler fought to protect the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Consulate" id="w">Consulate</a> in <a href="/wiki/Honduras" id="w">Honduras</a> from rebels. It was an incident during that expedition which allegedly earned him the first of several colorful nicknames, &#34;Old Gimlet Eye,&#34; attributed to the feverish, bloodshot eyes which enhanced his habitually penetrating and bellicose stare.<sup id="_ref-MCLegacyMuseum_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MCLegacyMuseum" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

Between the <a href="/wiki/Spanish-American_War" id="w">Spanish-American War</a> and the American entry into the first <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War</a> in 1917, Butler achieved the distinction, shared with only one other Marine (<a href="/wiki/Dan_Daly" id="w">Dan Daly</a>) since that time, of being twice awarded the <a href="/wiki/Medal_of_Honor" id="w">Medal of Honor</a> for separate incidents of outstanding gallantry in action.<sup id="_ref-MCHeritageMuseum_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MCHeritageMuseum" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first award was for his activities in the U.S. occupation of Veracruz, Mexico in 1914. But the large number of Medals of Honor awarded during that campaign&#8212;one for the Army, nine for Marines and 46 to Navy personnel&#8212;diminished the medal&#39;s prestige.  During World War I, Butler, then a major, attempted to return his Medal of Honor, explaining that he had done nothing to deserve it. It was returned with orders that not only would he keep it, but that he would wear it as well.<sup id="_ref-AboveAndBeyond114_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AboveAndBeyond114" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Marines tried to secure <a href="/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_Haiti_(1915-1934)" id="w">Haiti</a> against the &#34;Cacos&#34; rebels in 1915.  On <a href="/wiki/October_24" id="w">October 24</a> <a href="/wiki/1915" id="w">1915</a>, a patrol of forty-four mounted Marines led by Butler was ambushed by some 400 Cacos. The Marines maintained their perimeter throughout the night, and early the next morning they charged the much larger enemy force from three directions. The startled Haitians fled. Sergeant Major <a href="/wiki/Dan_Daly" id="w">Dan Daly</a> received a Medal of Honor for his gallantry in the battle.<sup id="_ref-MCHeritageMuseum_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MCHeritageMuseum" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>By mid-November 1915, most of the Cacos had been dispersed from the Haitian region. The remainder took refuge at Fort Rivière, an old French-built stronghold deep within the country. Fort Rivière sat atop Montagne Noire, the front reachable by a steep, rocky slope. The other three sides fell away so steeply that an approach from those directions was impossible. Some Marine officers argued that it should be assaulted by a regiment supported by artillery, but Butler convinced his colonel to allow him to attack with just four companies of 24 men each, plus two machine gun detachments. Butler and his men took the rebel stronghold on <a href="/wiki/November_17" id="w">November 17</a> <a href="/wiki/1915" id="w">1915</a>, in which he received his second Medal of Honor, for which he also received the <a href="/wiki/Haitian_Medal_of_Honor" id="w">Haitian Medal of Honor</a>. Major Butler recalled that his troops &#34;hunted the Cacos like pigs.&#34; His exploits impressed <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" id="w">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> (FDR), then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, who awarded the medal for an engagement in which 200 Cacos were killed and no prisoners taken, while one Marine was struck by a rock and lost two teeth.<sup id="_ref-ChomskyCh8unselfish_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ChomskyCh8unselfish" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Later, as the initial organizer and commanding officer of the Haitian Gendarmerie, the native police force, Butler established a record as a capable administrator.  Under his supervision, order was largely restored, and many vital public works projects were successfully completed.<sup id="_ref-MCLegacyMuseum_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MCLegacyMuseum" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<dl><dd>As Commanding Officer of detachments from the 5th, 13th, 23d Companies and the marine and sailor detachment from the U.S.S. Connecticut, Maj. Butler led the attack on Fort Riviere, Haiti, 17 November 1915. Following a concentrated drive, several different detachments of marines gradually closed in on the old French bastion fort in an effort to cut off all avenues of retreat for the Caco bandits. Reaching the fort on the southern side where there was a small opening in the wall, Maj. Butler gave the signal to attack and marines from the 15th Company poured through the breach, engaged the Cacos in hand-to-hand combat, took the bastion and crushed the Caco resistance. Throughout this perilous action, Maj. Butler was conspicuous for his bravery and forceful leadership.<sup id="_ref-CMOHS_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CMOHS" title="">[11]</a></sup></dd></dl>

During <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, Butler, much to his disappointment, was not assigned to a combat command on the Western Front. While his superiors considered him brave and brilliant, they also described him as &#34;unreliable.&#34;<sup id="_ref-book_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-book" title="">[7]</a></sup>
He was, however, promoted to the rank of <a href="/wiki/Brigadier_general" id="w">brigadier general</a> at the age of 37 and placed in command of Camp Pontanezen at <a href="/wiki/Brest%2C_France" id="w">Brest</a>, France. In October 1918, a debarkation depot near Brest funneled troops of the <a href="/wiki/American_Expeditionary_Force" id="w">American Expeditionary Force</a> to the battlefields.  The camp was plagued by horribly unsanitary, overcrowded and disorganized conditions. <a href="/wiki/U.S._Secretary_of_War" id="w">U.S. Secretary of War</a> <a href="/wiki/Newton_Baker" id="w">Newton Baker</a> sent novelist <a href="/wiki/Mary_Roberts_Rinehart" id="w">Mary Roberts Rinehart</a> to report on the camp.  She later described how Butler began by solving the mud problem: &#34;[T]he ground under the tents was nothing but mud, [so] he had raided the wharf at Brest of the duckboards no longer needed for the trenches, carted the first one himself up that four-mile hill to the camp, and thus provided something in the way of protection for the men to sleep on.&#34;<sup id="_ref-book_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-book" title="">[7]</a></sup>
General <a href="/wiki/John_J._Pershing" id="w">John J. Pershing</a> authorized a duckboard shoulder patch for the units. This won Butler another nickname, &#34;Old Duckboard.&#34; For his services, Butler earned not only the <a href="/wiki/Distinguished_Service_Medal_(United_States)" id="w">Distinguished Service Medal</a> of both the Army and the Navy but also the <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a> Order of the Black Star.<sup id="_ref-MCHeritageMuseum_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MCHeritageMuseum" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following the war, Butler became Commanding General of the Marine Barracks, Quantico, Virginia, and served in this capacity until January 1924, when he was granted leave of absence to accept the post of Director of Public Safety of the City of Philadelphia.  While there he transformed the wartime training camp at <a href="/wiki/Quantico%2C_Virginia" id="w">Quantico, Virginia</a> into a permanent Marine post.<sup id="_ref-MCHeritageMuseum_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MCHeritageMuseum" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Director_of_Public_Safety" name="Director_of_Public_Safety"></a><h3>Director of Public Safety</h3>
<p>On official leave of absence from the Marine Corps from January 1924 to December 1925, Butler briefly became the Director of Public Safety in <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>.  Due to the influence of  Butler&#39;s father, the congressman, the newly elected mayor of Philadelphia, W. Freeland Kendrick, asked Butler to leave the Marines to become Director of Public Safety, the official in charge of running the police and fire departments. Philadelphia&#39;s municipal government was notoriously corrupt.<sup id="_ref-MCHeritageMuseum_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MCHeritageMuseum" title="">[9]</a></sup>  Butler refused at first, but when Kendrick asked President <a href="/wiki/Calvin_Coolidge" id="w">Calvin Coolidge</a> to intervene, and Coolidge contacted Butler to say that he could take the necessary leave from the Corps, Butler agreed.<sup id="_ref-MCHeritageMuseum_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MCHeritageMuseum" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Within days, Butler ordered raids on more than 900 <a href="/wiki/Speakeasy" id="w">speakeasies</a>. Butler also went after <a href="/wiki/Rum-runner" id="w">bootleggers</a>, prostitutes, gamblers and corrupt police officers. 
Butler was more zealous than politic in his duties; in addition to going after gangsters and the working-class joints, Butler raided the social elites&#39; favorite speakeasies, the Ritz-Carlton and the Union League.  A week later, Kendrick fired Butler. Butler later said &#34;cleaning up Philadelphia was worse than any battle I was ever in.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MarineCorps_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MarineCorps" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<a id="China_and_stateside_service" name="China_and_stateside_service"></a><h3>China and stateside service</h3>
<p>From 1927 to 1929, Butler was commander of the Marine Expeditionary Force in <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a>.  He cleverly parlayed among various nationalist generals and warlords in order to protect American lives and property, and ultimately won the public acclaim of contending Chinese leaders.<sup id="_ref-MCHeritageMuseum_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MCHeritageMuseum" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>When Butler returned to the United States, in 1929, he was promoted.  At 48, he became the Marine Corps&#39; youngest <a href="/wiki/Major_general" id="w">major general</a>. He directed the Quantico camp&#39;s growth until it became the &#34;showplace&#34; of the Corps.<sup id="_ref-AH_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AH" title="">[14]</a></sup>
Butler also won national attention by taking thousands of his men on long field marches, many of which he led from the front, to Gettysburg and other Civil War battle sites, where they conducted large-scale re-enactments before crowds of often distinguished spectators.<sup id="_ref-AH_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AH" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1931, Butler publicly recounted gossip about <a href="/wiki/Benito_Mussolini" id="w">Benito Mussolini</a> in which the dictator allegedly struck a child with his automobile in a hit-and-run accident. The <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italian</a> government protested, and President <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Hoover" id="w">Hoover</a>, who strongly disliked Butler, forced <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Navy" id="w">Secretary of the Navy</a> Adams to <a href="/wiki/Court-martial" id="w">court-martial</a> Butler.

Butler was known for his outspoken lectures against <a href="/wiki/War_profiteer" id="w">war profiteering</a> and what he viewed as nascent <a href="/wiki/Fascism" id="w">fascism</a> in the United States.  During the 1930s, he gave many such speeches to <a href="/wiki/Pacifism" id="w">pacifist</a> groups. Between 1935 and 1937, he served as a spokesman for the <a href="/wiki/American_League_Against_War_and_Fascism" id="w">American League Against War and Fascism</a> (which some considered <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">communist</a>-dominated).<sup id="_ref-hans_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hans" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>In his 1935 book, <i><a href="/wiki/War_Is_a_Racket" id="w">War Is a Racket</a></i>, Butler presented an <a href="/wiki/Expos%C3%A9_(journalism)" id="w">exposé</a> and trenchant condemnation of the profit motive behind warfare. His views on the subject are well summarized in the following passage from a 1935 issue of &#34;the non-<a href="/wiki/Marxism" id="w">Marxist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialist</a>&#34;  magazine, <i>Common Sense</i> &#8212; one of Butler&#39;s most widely quoted statements:</p>
<dl><dd><i>&#34;I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class <a href="/wiki/Enforcer" id="w">muscle man</a> for <a href="/wiki/Big_Business" id="w">Big Business</a>, for <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street" id="w">Wall Street</a> and the bankers.

I helped in the raping of half a dozen <a href="/wiki/Central_America" id="w">Central American</a> <a href="/wiki/Banana_republic" id="w">republics</a> for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify <a href="/wiki/Nicaragua" id="w">Nicaragua</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Merchant_bank" id="w">International Banking House</a> of <a href="/wiki/Brown_Brothers_Harriman" id="w">Brown Brothers</a> in 1902-1912.  I brought light to the <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" id="w">Dominican Republic</a> for the American <a href="/wiki/Sugarcane" id="w">sugar</a> interests in 1916.  I helped make Honduras right for the American <a href="/wiki/United_Fruit_Company" id="w">fruit companies</a> in 1903.  In <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> in 1927 I helped see to it that <a href="/wiki/Standard_Oil" id="w">Standard Oil</a> went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given <a href="/wiki/Al_Capone" id="w">Al Capone</a> a few hints.
