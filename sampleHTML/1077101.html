The <b>Eifel Aqueduct</b> was one of the longest <a href="/wiki/Aqueduct_(Roman)" id="w">aqueducts</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Roman Empire</a>. It shows the great skill of the Roman <a href="/wiki/Engineering" id="w">engineers</a>, whose <a href="/wiki/Roman_technology" id="w">level of technical achievement</a> was lost in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a> and regained only in recent times.</p>
<p>The aqueduct, constructed in AD 80, carried water some 95&#160;km (60&#160;miles) from the hilly <a href="/wiki/Eifel" id="w">Eifel</a> region of what is now <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> to the ancient city of Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (present-day <a href="/wiki/Cologne" id="w">Cologne</a>). If the auxiliary spurs to additional <a href="/wiki/Spring_(hydrosphere)" id="w">springs</a> are included, the length was 130&#160;km (80&#160;miles). The construction was almost entirely below ground, and the flow of the water was produced entirely by <a href="/wiki/Gravity" id="w">gravity</a>. A few bridges, including one up to 1,400&#160;m (0.87&#160;miles) in length, were needed to pass over valleys. Unlike some of the other famous Roman aqueducts, the Eifel aqueduct was specifically designed to minimize the above-ground portion to protect it from damage and freezing.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<p>Before the building of the Eifel Aqueduct, Cologne got its water from the Vorgebirge aqueduct, which had its source in the springs and streams from the <a href="/wiki/Ville" id="w">Ville</a> region to the west of the city. As the city grew, this aqueduct was no longer able to provide enough water of sufficient quality: the springs contained a small amount of silt in the summer, and sometimes even ran dry. A new aqueduct was built to bring water from the springs of the Eifel into the city.</p>
<p>The Eifel aqueduct was built in the northern part of the region. The construction is of <a href="/wiki/Concrete" id="w">concrete</a> with stones forming an arched covering. It had a maximum capacity of approximately 20,000&#160;m³ (4.4 &#160;million UK <a href="/wiki/Gallon" id="w">gallons</a>) of drinking water daily. The aqueduct provided water for the fountains, baths, and private homes of Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium. The aqueduct remained in use until about 260, when the city was first plundered by the <a href="/wiki/Germanic_peoples" id="w">German tribes</a>. After this date, it was never brought back into operation, and the city obtained its water from the old Vorgebirge Aqueduct.</p>

<p>The aqueduct began at a spring in the area of <a href="/wiki/Nettersheim" id="w">Nettersheim</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Urft" id="w">Urft</a> river valley. It then travelled along the valley to <a href="/wiki/Kall%2C_Germany" id="w">Kall</a>, where it had to overcome the <a href="/wiki/Drainage_divide" id="w">divide</a> between the <a href="/wiki/Meuse_River" id="w">Maas</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Rhine" id="w">Rhine</a>. The Roman engineers chose this spot because they were able to overcome the divide without resorting to a tunnel or a pump. The aqueduct then ran parallel to the northern Eifel Mountain, crossing the <a href="/wiki/Erft" id="w">Erft</a> near <a href="/wiki/Kreuzweingarten" id="w">Kreuzweingarten</a> (in the <a href="/wiki/Euskirchen_(district)" id="w">Euskirchen</a> district) and the <a href="/wiki/Swist" id="w">Swistbach</a> with an arched bridge. In <a href="/wiki/Naturpark_Kottenforst-Ville" id="w">Kottenforst</a>, northwest of <a href="/wiki/Bonn" id="w">Bonn</a>, it passed through the Vorgebirge highlands. Finally, it ran through <a href="/wiki/Br%C3%BChl%2C_North_Rhine-Westphalia" id="w">Brühl</a> and <a href="/wiki/H%C3%BCrth" id="w">Hürth</a> before arriving in Cologne. Other springs in the region that met Roman quality and quantity guidelines were also equipped with aqueducts to feed the main line.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Reconstructed aqueduct near Mechernich-Vussem</div>
To protect against frost, most of the aqueduct ran about 1&#160;m below the earth&#39;s surface. Archaeological excavations show that, at the lowest level, the Roman engineers had placed a loose layer of stones. On this base, they set a concrete or stone U-shaped groove for the water and, over this, cut stones and <a href="/wiki/Mortar_(masonry)" id="w">mortar</a> were used to build a protective <a href="/wiki/Arch" id="w">arch</a>.</p>
<p>For the concrete work and the arch, the engineers used boards to build the form. Impressions of the wood grain remain in the concrete 2,000 years later. The aqueduct had an inner width of 70&#160;<a href="/wiki/Centimetre" id="w">cm</a> (28&#160;<a href="/wiki/Inch" id="w">inches</a>) and a height of 1&#160;m (3.3&#160;<a href="/wiki/Foot_(unit_of_length)" id="w">feet</a>), so a worker could enter the tube when necessary. The outside of the aqueduct was <a href="/wiki/Plaster" id="w">plastered</a> to keep dirty water out. At several locations, a drainage system was set up alongside the aqueduct to keep ground water away. Smaller streams crossed the aqueduct through passages: one, very near the source, is still well-preserved.</p>
<p>The inside of the aqueduct was also plastered with a reddish mixture called <i>opus signinum</i>. This mixture contained <a href="/wiki/Calcium_oxide" id="w">lime</a> as well as crushed <a href="/wiki/Brick" id="w">bricks</a>. This material hardened under water and prevented leakages to the outside. Small cracks were sealed with wood ash, which was strewn over them the first time the aqueduct was set in operation.</p>

<p><div style="wigth:300px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:300px-Eifelwasserleitung02.jpg" title="The spring at &#39;&#39;Grüner Pütz&#39;&#39; is marked by a Roman pool."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300px-Eifelwasserleitung02.jpg" alt="The spring at &#39;&#39;Grüner Pütz&#39;&#39; is marked by a Roman pool." title="The spring at &#39;&#39;Grüner Pütz&#39;&#39; is marked by a Roman pool." class="location-none type-thumb" width="300px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The spring at <i>Grüner Pütz</i> is marked by a Roman pool.</div></div>

Several springs in the area were fitted with constructions to aid their direction into the aqueduct. The first is at the source, <i>Grüner Pütz</i> near Nettersheim. The most studied is the &#34;Klaus fountain&#34; at <a href="/wiki/Mechernich" id="w">Mechernich</a>. This site has been archaeologically reconstructed and preserved. The constructions at the various springs were designed to fit in with the characteristics of the area and would meet today&#39;s technical requirements.</p>
<p>There were four major areas of springs:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Grüner Pütz</i> (Green well) near Nettersheim</li>
<li><i>Klausbrunnen</i> (Klaus fountain) near <a href="/wiki/Mechernich" id="w">Mechernich</a></li>
<li>An area of springs in Mechernich-Urfey</li>
<li>The <i>Hausener Benden</i> in Mechernich-Eiserfey</li></ul>
<p>The spring area <i>Hausener Benden</i>, also near Mechernich, is interesting because it was discovered rather late and was put back into use. In 1938, while searching for a drinking water source for Mechernich, the workers encountered the feed line for the aqueduct from this area. The water from the feed was simply connected into the modern water network. So as not to damage the spring, they carried out no archaeological search for the construction around the spring.</p>

Romans preferred <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" id="w">drinking water</a> with a high <a href="/wiki/Hard_water" id="w">mineral content</a>, preferring its taste to that of <a href="/wiki/Soft_water" id="w">soft water</a>.  Roman architect <a href="/wiki/Vitruvius" id="w">Vitruvius</a> described the process for testing a source of drinking water:
{{cquote}}</p>
<p>Vitruvius insisted (8,3,28), &#34;Consequently we must take great care and pains in searching for springs and selecting them, keeping in view the health of mankind.&#34; The water from the Eifel aqueduct was considered to be some of the very best water in the empire.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hard water tends to produce <a href="/wiki/Calcium_carbonate" id="w">calcium carbonate</a> deposits, and all areas of the aqueduct today have a thick layer of <a href="/wiki/Limestone" id="w">limestone</a>-like deposits up to 20&#160;cm (8&#160;inches) thick.  Despite the reduction in the cross-sectional area of the aqueduct caused by these deposits, the aqueduct was still able to provide the necessary quantity of water for Cologne. In the Middle Ages, the layer of &#34;Eifel marble&#34; from the aqueduct was widely reused as building material.</p>
<a id="Above-ground_sections" name="Above-ground_sections"></a><h1>Above-ground sections</h1>
<p>For various reasons, the Eifel aqueduct has very few above-ground sections, unlike other Roman aqueducts, such as the <a href="/wiki/Pont_du_Gard" id="w">Pont du Gard</a> in southern <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The course of the aqueduct was chosen so as to avoid the need for such constructions.</li>
<li>By construction underground, the aqueduct was protected from freezing.</li>
<li>The water arriving in Cologne had a pleasant temperature due to the insulating properties of the ground.</li>
<li>In case of war, the aqueduct would be less easily damaged.</li></ul>
<p>Nonetheless, there are a few places where bridges or other constructions were necessary. The most notable was an arched bridge over the Swistbach near <a href="/wiki/Rheinbach" id="w">Rheinbach</a> that was 1,400&#160;m (0.86&#160;miles) long and up to 10&#160;m (32.8&#160;ft) high. Archaeologists calculate that the original bridge had 295 arches, each 3.56&#160;m (11.7&#160;ft) wide, but the bridge has been reduced to rubble with the passage of the years.</p>
<p>A smaller arched bridge crossed a valley near Mechernich. This was some 10&#160;m (32.8&#160;ft) tall and 70&#160;m (230&#160;ft) long. The archaeological remains were in good enough condition here that a partial reconstruction was built to show how the original must have looked.</p>
<a id="Roman_aqueduct_construction" name="Roman_aqueduct_construction"></a><h1>Roman aqueduct construction</h1>
<p>Construction of the aqueduct placed great demands on the capacities and knowledge of the Roman engineers. The Romans occasionally suffered problems of low-quality work on large projects, as witnessed by <a href="/wiki/Sextus_Julius_Frontinus" id="w">Sextus Julius Frontinus</a>, lead official for water resources in the city of <a href="/wiki/Rome" id="w">Rome</a>, who wrote:
{{cquote}}</p>
<a id="Cost_of_building" name="Cost_of_building"></a><h2>Cost of building</h2>
<p>Considering the amount of <a href="/wiki/Surveying" id="w">surveying</a>, underground building, and bricklaying involved, a construction of this size could not be built all at once. Instead, the engineers divided the entire construction site into individual building areas. Through archaeological research, the boundaries of these building areas have been determined. For the Eifel aqueduct, they were 15,000&#160;Roman feet long (4,400&#160;m or 2.7&#160;miles in modern units). It has further been demonstrated that the surveying took place separately from the building, as is in fact the rule today in large construction projects.</p>
<p>For each metre (3.3&#160;ft) of aqueduct, approximately 3&#8211;4&#160;m³ (100&#8211;140&#160;ft³) of earth had to be dug up, followed by 1.5&#160;m³ (50&#160;feet³) of concrete and bricklaying, along with 2.2&#160;<a href="/wiki/Square_metre" id="w">m²</a> (24&#160;<a href="/wiki/Square_foot" id="w">feet²</a>) of plaster sealant. The complete labour expense is estimated at 475,000&#160;man-days: with about 180 possible construction days in the year due to weather conditions, 2,500 workers would have worked 16 months to complete the project. The actual construction time appears to have been even longer, since this estimate leaves out the question of surveying and production of the building materials.</p>
<p>After construction, the building trenches were filled in, the surface flattened, and a maintenance path built. The maintenance path also served to delimit areas where <a href="/wiki/Farming" id="w">farming</a> was not permissible. Other Roman aqueducts show similar facilities. The aqueduct to <a href="/wiki/Lyon" id="w">Lyon</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> was marked with the following inscription:
{{cquote}}</p>
<a id="Roman_surveying" name="Roman_surveying"></a><h2>Roman surveying</h2>
<p>After a good location for the aqueduct was selected, it was necessary to guarantee a constant slope downwards in its course. Using devices similar to modern levels, the Roman engineers were capable of maintaining a slope as small as 0.1&#160;percent&#8212;one&#160;metre of fall for every kilometre of aqueduct. In addition to the slope, it was necessary for the various building sections to be able to join up, while still maintaining a constant downward slope.</p>
<p>The Roman constructors of the Eifel aqueduct carefully made use of the natural fall of the land. If the work from one segment arrived too high for the next segment, they built a small pool into the course to calm the falling water.</p>
<a id="Roman_concrete" name="Roman_concrete"></a><h2>Roman concrete</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Concrete" id="w">concrete</a> used for the Eifel aqueduct was a combination of <a href="/wiki/Calcium_oxide" id="w">lime</a>, sand, stones, and water. Boards were used to make a form into which the concrete was packed. Modern tests of the quality of the concrete show that it would pass current standards. This particular concrete is called <i>opus caementicium</i> in <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a>.</p>
<a id="Operation_of_the_aqueduct" name="Operation_of_the_aqueduct"></a><h1>Operation of the aqueduct</h1>
<p><div style="wigth:300px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:300px-Eifelwasserleitung03.jpg" title="Maintenance personnel could enter into the channel of the aqueduct through shafts like this one."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300px-Eifelwasserleitung03.jpg" alt="Maintenance personnel could enter into the channel of the aqueduct through shafts like this one." title="Maintenance personnel could enter into the channel of the aqueduct through shafts like this one." class="location-none type-thumb" width="300px" />

<div class="thumbcaption">Maintenance personnel could enter into the channel of the aqueduct through shafts like this one.</div></div>

For the 180 years of the aqueduct&#39;s use, from AD 80 to 260, the aqueduct required constant maintenance, improvement, cleaning, and freeing from limestone accretions.  Maintenance was facilitated by regular maintenance shafts, through which a worker could descend into the aqueduct. Additional maintenance shafts were built at the sites of repairs and at the boundaries between building segments. There were also open pools at points where various springs ran together so that maintenance personnel could keep an eye on problem areas.</p>
<a id="Distribution_of_water_in_ancient_Cologne" name="Distribution_of_water_in_ancient_Cologne"></a><h1>Distribution of water in ancient Cologne</h1>
<p>For the last few kilometres before the ancient city, the aqueduct left the ground and was supported by an aqueduct bridge approximately 10&#160;m (33&#160;ft) high.  This additional construction enabled water to be delivered to the higher-lying areas of the city through pressurised pipes. The pipes at the time were made of <a href="/wiki/Lead" id="w">lead</a> plates bent into a ring, either <a href="/wiki/Solder" id="w">soldered</a> together or with flanges to bind the individual pipe sections together. The Romans used <a href="/wiki/Bronze" id="w">bronze</a> fixtures as <a href="/wiki/Tap_(valve)" id="w">taps</a>.</p>
<p>Incoming water arrived first at the various public fountains of the city, which were always in operation. The fountain network was so dense that no resident had to travel more than 50&#160;m (164&#160;ft) to get water. In addition, various public baths and private homes, as well as public <a href="/wiki/Toilet" id="w">toilets</a> were provided with water. Waste water was collected in a network of canals under the city and led out into the <a href="/wiki/Rhine" id="w">Rhine</a>. One section of the Roman <a href="/wiki/Sewer" id="w">sewer</a> system is open for tourists under <i>Budengasse</i> Street in Cologne.</p>

The Eifel aqueduct was destroyed by Germanic tribes in 260 during an attack on Cologne, and was never brought back into operation, even though the city continued to exist. In the course of the migration of the various tribes through the region, aqueduct technology fell out of use and knowledge. The entire aqueduct remained buried in the earth some 500 years, until the <a href="/wiki/Carolingian" id="w">Carolingians</a> began new construction in the Rhine valley. As this area has relatively little naturally occurring stone, the aqueduct became a favoured place for obtaining building materials. Transportable sections of the aqueduct were used to build the <a href="/wiki/City_wall" id="w">city wall</a> around Rhinebach, for instance. Some of these sections still have the sealing plaster from the aqueduct intact. Thus all of the above-ground sections, and a good part of the underground construction as well, were dismantled and reused in medieval construction.</p>
<p>Particularly desirable as a building material were the limestone-like accretions from the inside of the aqueduct. In the course of operation of the aqueduct, many sections had a layer as thick as 20&#160;cm (8&#160;inches). The material had a consistency similar to brown <a href="/wiki/Marble" id="w">marble</a> and was easily removable from the aqueduct. Upon polishing, it showed veins, and it could also be used like a stone board when cut flat. This artificial stone found use throughout the Rhineland and was very popular for <a href="/wiki/Column" id="w">columns</a>, window frames, and even <a href="/wiki/Altar" id="w">altars</a>. Use of &#34;Eifel marble&#34; can be seen as far east as <a href="/wiki/Paderborn" id="w">Paderborn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hildesheim" id="w">Hildesheim</a>, where it was used in the <a href="/wiki/Cathedral" id="w">cathedrals</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Denmark" id="w">Danish</a> cathedral at <a href="/wiki/Roskilde" id="w">Roskilde</a> is the northernmost location of its use, where several gravestones are made of it.</p>
<p>Medieval legend held that the aqueduct was an underground passage from <a href="/wiki/Trier" id="w">Trier</a> to Cologne. According to the legend, the <a href="/wiki/Devil" id="w">Devil</a> had bet the architect of the <a href="/wiki/Cologne_cathedral" id="w">Cologne cathedral</a> that he could build this tunnel faster than the cathedral could be erected. The architect took the bet and drove the men to work with great haste. One day, the construction workers broke into the aqueduct, where flowing water could be seen. The Devil&#39;s giggling is said to have driven the architect to suicide by jumping from the half-finished cathedral tower. Supposedly, the architect&#39;s death (and not the lack of funds) was the cause of the centuries-long delay in the completion of the construction.</p>
<p>A few mediaeval writings on the aqueduct lost sight completely of the original purpose of the construction. Some say that it carried not water, but wine to the city, for example, the <i><a href="/wiki/Gesta_Treverorum" id="w">Gesta Treverorum</a></i> of <a href="/wiki/Maternus" id="w">Maternus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Cologne" id="w">Bishop of Cologne</a>, (4th century) and the <i>Hymn to Saint Anno</i> of the 11th century.</p>

It may also be used as a bike trail.  There are approximately 75 information stations along the way, providing an excellent view of the aqueduct.</p>
<a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h1>Legacy</h1>
<p><a href="/wiki/Archaeology" id="w">Archaeological</a> research on the Eifel aqueduct started in the 19th century. CA Eick was the discoverer of the farthest source from Cologne at <i>Grüner Pütz</i> near Nettersheim (in 1867). Systematic study of the aqueduct was carried out from 1940 to 1970 by Waldemar Haberey. His 1971 book is still a suitable guide along the course of the construction. In 1980, archaeologist Klaus Grewe completely mapped out the location line and added it to the official German topographic map. His <i>Atlas der römischen Wasserleitungen nach Köln</i> (Atlas of Roman Aqueducts to Cologne) is a standard work for researchers in Roman architecture.</p>
<p>The Eifel aqueduct is a very important and valuable archaeological site, particularly for the study of Roman surveying, organizational ability, and engineering know-how. It is also a poignant symbol for the loss of technical knowledge during the decline of <a href="/wiki/Civilisations" id="w">civilisations</a> that between the Middle Ages and more recent times, no better use was found for the aqueduct than as a stone quarry. The Roman level of <a href="/wiki/Technology" id="w">technology</a> in this area was not equalled until the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
