<b>Sex Pistols</b> are an <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> <a href="/wiki/Punk_rock" id="w">punk rock</a> <a href="/wiki/Band_(music)" id="w">band</a> that formed in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> in 1975. The band originally comprised vocalist <a href="/wiki/John_Lydon" id="w">Johnny Rotten</a>, guitarist <a href="/wiki/Steve_Jones_(musician)" id="w">Steve Jones</a>, drummer <a href="/wiki/Paul_Cook" id="w">Paul Cook</a> and bassist <a href="/wiki/Glen_Matlock" id="w">Glen Matlock</a> (later replaced by <a href="/wiki/Sid_Vicious" id="w">Sid Vicious</a>). Although their initial career lasted only three years and produced only four singles and one studio album, <i><a href="/wiki/Never_Mind_the_Bollocks%2C_Here%26%2339%3Bs_the_Sex_Pistols" id="w">Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#39;s the Sex Pistols</a></i>, the Sex Pistols have been described by the <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a> as &#34;the definitive English punk rock band.&#34;<sup id="_ref-BBC1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The Pistols are widely credited with initiating the punk movement in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> and creating the first <a href="/wiki/Generation_gap" id="w">generation gap</a> within <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" id="w">rock and roll</a>.<sup id="_ref-Robb2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Robb2" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Sex Pistols emerged as a response to what was perceived to be the &#34;increasingly safe and bloated&#34; <a href="/wiki/Progressive_rock" id="w">progressive rock</a><sup id="_ref-thesexpistol_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thesexpistol" title="">[4]</a></sup> and manufactured <a href="/wiki/Pop_music" id="w">pop music</a> of the mid-1970s. The band created various controversies during their brief career which captivated Britain,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> but often eclipsed their music.<sup id="_ref-Robb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Robb" title="">[6]</a></sup> Their shows and tours repeatedly faced difficulties from authorities, and public appearances often ended in disaster and riot. Their 1977 single, &#34;<a href="/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen_(Sex_Pistols_song)" id="w">God Save the Queen</a>&#34;, was widely regarded as an attack on the <a href="/wiki/British_monarchy" id="w">British monarchy</a> and British <a href="/wiki/Nationalism" id="w">nationalism</a>.<sup id="_ref-_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Rotten left the band in January 1978, amid a turbulent tour of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>; the remaining trio carried on for the remainder of the year with vocals provided by Jones, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Tudor-Pole" id="w">Edward Tudor-Pole</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ronnie_Biggs" id="w">Ronnie Biggs</a> but disbanded in early 1979. With Lydon, they reunited in 1996 for the &#34;Filthy Lucre&#34; tour and have staged subsequent reunion tours in 2002, 2003, and 2007. On <a href="/wiki/24_February" id="w">24 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, the Sex Pistols were officially inducted into the <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, but they refused to attend the induction, calling the museum a &#34;piss stain&#34;.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> </p>

<a id="Origins_and_early_days" name="Origins_and_early_days"></a><h3> Origins and early days </h3>
<p>The Sex Pistols evolved from The Strand, a band formed in 1972 with Jones on vocals, Cook on drums and <a href="/wiki/Wally_Nightingale" id="w">Wally Nightingale</a> on guitar. Early line-ups also included Jim Mackin (now a GP practising in Lincolnshire) on organ, as well as Stephen Hayes, and later Del Noones, on bass.<sup id="_ref-Anarchist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anarchist" title="">[9]</a></sup> By 1973 the band members were spending time at <a href="/wiki/Don_Letts" id="w">Don Letts&#39;</a> <a href="/wiki/Acme_Attractions" id="w">Acme Attractions</a>, and the more upmarket <a href="/wiki/SEX_(boutique)" id="w">Let It Rock</a>,<sup id="_ref-Robb_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Robb" title="">[6]</a></sup> a 1950s-themed clothes shop in the <a href="/wiki/Kings_Road" id="w">Kings Road</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chelsea%2C_London" id="w">Chelsea</a> area of <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>. &#34;Let It Rock&#34; was owned by former <a href="/wiki/New_York_Dolls" id="w">New York Dolls</a> manager <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_McLaren" id="w">Malcolm McLaren</a> and his partner <a href="/wiki/Vivienne_Westwood" id="w">Vivienne Westwood</a>; the shop specialised in &#34;anti-fashion&#34;,<sup id="_ref-thesexpistol_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thesexpistol" title="">[4]</a></sup> selling the drapes, slashed T-shirts, <a href="/wiki/Brothel_creepers" id="w">brothel creepers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sexual_fetishism" id="w">fetish</a> gear<sup id="_ref-Robb_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Robb" title="">[6]</a></sup> later popularised by the punk movement. As Rotten observed: &#34;Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Robb_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Robb" title="">[6]</a></sup> The shop was to become a focal point of the punk rock scene, and brought together many of its primary members, including <a href="/wiki/Jordan_(Pamela_Rooke)" id="w">Jordan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Soo_Catwoman" id="w">Soo Catwoman</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Captain_Sensible" id="w">Captain Sensible</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sid_Vicious" id="w">John Ritchie</a> (later Sid Vicious), <a href="/wiki/Jah_Wobble" id="w">Jah Wobble</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gene_October" id="w">Gene October</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mick_Jones_(The_Clash)" id="w">Mick Jones</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tony_James" id="w">Tony James</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Marco_Pirroni" id="w">Marco Pirroni</a>.<sup id="_ref-Robb_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Robb" title="">[6]</a></sup> All were reacting to a distaste to the prevailing fashion of long hair and flared jeans of the early 1970s. McLaren took over management of the band around this time.   </p>    
<p>By then renamed &#34;The Swankers&#34;,<sup id="_ref-Frame_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frame" title="">[10]</a></sup> the band began rehearsing at the Crunchy Frog, a studio near the <a href="/wiki/London_Docklands" id="w">London Docklands</a>. In 1974, they played their first gig at Tom Salter&#39;s Café in London. Noones was ejected from the band shortly afterwards, due to his unreliability and unwillingness to rehearse.<sup id="_ref-Anarchist_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anarchist" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

Glen Matlock was recruited as bass player in early 1975. Around this time Jones and Nightingale began to argue over the band&#39;s musical direction, and Nightingale departed soon afterwards. In August 1975, <a href="/wiki/John_Lydon" id="w">John Lydon</a> (Johnny Rotten), was spotted by Jones at the now renamed and restyled <a href="/wiki/SEX_(boutique)" id="w">SEX</a> boutique. According to Jones: &#34;He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his &#39;I Hate <a href="/wiki/Pink_Floyd" id="w">Pink Floyd</a>&#39; T-shirt on. John had something special, but when he spoke he was a real asshole - but smart.&#34;<sup id="_ref-jlydon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jlydon" title="">[11]</a></sup> After miming along to <a href="/wiki/Alice_Cooper" id="w">Alice Cooper</a>&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/I%26%2339%3Bm_Eighteen" id="w">I&#39;m Eighteen</a>&#34; on the shop juke box and though he had never considered singing before, Rotten was asked to join as vocalist.<sup id="_ref-savage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-savage" title="">[12]</a></sup> Rotten and his circle of friends (including Soo Catwoman and <a href="/wiki/Bromley_Contingent" id="w">Bromley Contingent</a> members <a href="/wiki/Siouxsie_Sioux" id="w">Siouxsie Sioux</a>, <a href="/wiki/Steve_Severin" id="w">Steve Severin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Billy_Idol" id="w">Billy Idol</a>),<sup id="_ref-bctg_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bctg" title="">[13]</a></sup> were by now dressing in the torn-shirt, <a href="/wiki/Sado-masochist" id="w">sado-masochistic</a> inspired clothing sold by <a href="/wiki/Vivienne_Westwood" id="w">Vivienne Westwood</a>;<sup id="_ref-BBC1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC1" title="">[1]</a></sup> the trend quickly spread, and was adopted by the band&#39;s fans.<sup id="_ref-savage_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-savage" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/NME" id="w">NME</a></i> journalist <a href="/wiki/Nick_Kent" id="w">Nick Kent</a> used to jam occasionally with the band, but left upon Rotten&#39;s recruitment.

<p>One of McLaren&#39;s first acts as manager was to rename the band. Among the options considered were &#39;Le Bomb&#39;, &#39;Subterraneans&#39;, &#39;Beyond&#39; and &#39;Teenage Novel&#39;. The band played their first gig as Sex Pistols at <a href="/wiki/Central_Saint_Martins_College_of_Art_and_Design" id="w">Saint Martins College</a>, on <a href="/wiki/6_November" id="w">6 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a>,<sup id="_ref-Frame_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frame" title="">[10]</a></sup> though they were thrown off before finishing their first song. The gig had been arranged by Matlock, who was studying there at the time. This gig was followed by other performances at colleges and art schools around London. In early 1976, the Sex Pistols began to play larger venues such as the <a href="/wiki/100_Club" id="w">100 Club</a>, and the Nashville. On <a href="/wiki/4_June" id="w">4 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a>, at the invitation of Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley of Buzzcocks, the band played their first gig in <a href="/wiki/Manchester" id="w">Manchester</a> at the Lesser <a href="/wiki/Free_Trade_Hall" id="w">Free Trade Hall</a>, which led to an explosion in new music there.{{Fact}} On <a href="/wiki/3_September" id="w">3 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a>, the Pistols played their first concert outside Britain, at the opening of the Club De Chalet Du Lac in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a>. Their first major tour of Britain soon followed, lasting from mid-September to early October.</p>

Their behaviour, as much as their music, brought them national attention. On <a href="/wiki/1_December" id="w">1 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a> the band and members of the <a href="/wiki/Bromley_Contingent" id="w">Bromley Contingent</a> created a storm of publicity by swearing during an early evening live broadcast of <a href="/wiki/Thames_Television" id="w">Thames Television</a>&#39;s <i>Today</i> programme. Appearing as last-minute replacements for fellow EMI artists <a href="/wiki/Queen_(band)" id="w">Queen</a>, band and entourage took full advantage of the Green Room facilities, and consumed large amounts of alcohol. During the interview, Rotten used the word &#34;shit&#34;, and host <a href="/wiki/Bill_Grundy" id="w">Bill Grundy</a>, who was drunk at the time, flirted openly with <a href="/wiki/Siouxsie_Sioux" id="w">Siouxsie Sioux</a> (&#34;We&#39;ll meet afterwards, shall we?&#34;). This prompted Jones to call Grundy a &#34;dirty sod&#34;. Grundy responded by requesting that the band &#34;Go on..you&#39;ve got 5 more seconds, say something outrageous&#34;,<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> to which Jones replied: &#34;you dirty old man...you dirty bastard&#34;. Grundy, becoming angry, told Jones &#34;Again!&#34; to which he replied &#34;you dirty <i>fucker</i> . . . what a fucking rotter.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Barkham
_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barkham
" title="">[19]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Although the programme was only broadcast in the London region, the ensuing furore occupied the <a href="/wiki/Tabloid" id="w">tabloid</a> newspapers for days. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Mirror" id="w">The Daily Mirror</a></i> famously ran the headline &#34;The Filth and the Fury&#34;, while the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Express" id="w">Daily Express</a></i> led with &#34;Punk? Call it Filthy Lucre&#34;—phrases Lydon adopted for Pistols projects many years later. Thames Television suspended Grundy, and though he was later reinstated, the interview effectively ended his career.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>The episode created mass publicity for the band and brought punk into the mainstream. The &#39;Anarchy&#39; tour of the UK followed, though many of the concerts were either crowded by hostile press or cancelled by local authorities.<sup id="_ref-savage_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-savage" title="">[12]</a></sup> London councilor Bernard Brook Partridge, during a television interview conducted at the time, declared: &#34;Some of these groups would be vastly improved by sudden death . . . I would like to see someone dig a huge hole and bury the lot of them in it&#34;.<sup id="_ref-fatf_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fatf" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following the end of the tour in December 1976, EMI arranged a series of concerts for January 1977 at the Paradiso in <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam" id="w">Amsterdam</a>.<sup id="_ref-BBC2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC2" title="">[22]</a></sup> But before boarding the plane at <a href="/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport" id="w">London Heathrow Airport</a>, the band reportedly spat on each other and verbally abused airport staff. &#34;One witness claimed the Sex Pistols were doing something so disgusting that she could not repeat it for publication . . . it became generally believed Jones had been vomiting on old ladies in the preflight lounge,&#34; reported <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone_(magazine)" id="w">Rolling Stone</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-rstn_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rstn" title="">[17]</a></sup> EMI released the band from their contract two days later.<sup id="_ref-BBC2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC2" title="">[22]</a></sup> &#34;I don&#39;t understand it,&#34; Rotten remarked at the time. &#34;All we&#39;re trying to do is destroy everything.&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Sid_Vicious_joins_the_band" name="Sid_Vicious_joins_the_band"></a><h3> Sid Vicious joins the band </h3>
<p>The Paradiso gigs would be their last with Matlock, who parted company with the band in February 1977. According to popular legend he was sacked because he &#34;liked <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles" id="w">The Beatles</a>&#34;,<sup id="_ref-BBC1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC1" title="">[1]</a></sup> but Steve Jones later claimed the reason was that Matlock didn&#39;t &#34;fit in&#34; with the others, stating, obliquely, that Matlock was &#34;always washing his feet&#34;.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Matlock now claims to have quit voluntarily, mainly because of an increasingly acrimonious relationship with Rotten.<sup id="_ref-coon2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-coon2" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>Matlock was replaced by Rotten&#39;s friend and self-appointed &#34;ultimate Sex Pistols fan&#34;<sup id="_ref-Butt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Butt" title="">[26]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Sid_Vicious" id="w">Sid Vicious</a> (John Simon Ritchie), previously drummer of <a href="/wiki/Siouxsie_%26amp%3B_the_Banshees" id="w">Siouxsie &#38; the Banshees</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Flowers_of_Romance_(band)" id="w">The Flowers of Romance</a>. McLaren approved Vicious as a member on account of his look and &#34;punk attitude&#34;, despite his limited musical abilities.<sup id="_ref-mlock_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mlock" title="">[14]</a></sup> According to McLaren: &#34;When Sid joined he couldn&#39;t play guitar but his craziness fit into the structure of the band. He was the knight in shining armour with a giant fist.&#34;<sup id="_ref-popmatters_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-popmatters" title="">[27]</a></sup> Lydon later recalled: &#34;The first rehearsals with Sid were hellish. Everyone agreed he had the look. Sid tried real hard... but boy, he couldn&#39;t play bass.&#34;<sup id="_ref-jlydon_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jlydon" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In recent years McLaren stated that Vivienne Westood told him he should &#34;get the guy called John who came to the store a couple of times&#34; to be the singer, and that once he did and Johnny Rotten was recruited for the band, Vivienne said he had got it wrong, &#34;he had got the wrong John.&#34; She actually meant John Simon Ritchie (Sid Vicious) to be the singer.<sup id="_ref-Blood_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blood" title="">[28]</a></sup> According to this version of the events the original plan would have been to get Sid Vicious to be the singer and not Johnny Rotten, and Vivienne had always been interested in Sid but didn&#39;t have an opportunity to do so until Glenn Matlock left the band.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Marco_Pirroni" id="w">Marco Pirroni</a>: &#34;After that, it was nothing to do with music anymore. It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story...&#34;<sup id="_ref-popmatters_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-popmatters" title="">[27]</a></sup>  Vicious&#39; amplifier was often turned down, or off, during live performances,<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> and most of the bass parts on the band&#39;s later recordings were played by either Jones or Matlock.<sup id="_ref-jlydon_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jlydon" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Membership in the Sex Pistols began to have a destructive effect on Vicious &#39; personality. As Rotten observed: &#34;Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly he was a big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the right places, adoration. That&#39;s what it all meant to Sid.&#34;<sup id="_ref-popmatters_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-popmatters" title="">[27]</a></sup> Vicious responded by actively cultivating a notorious persona. Early in 1977, he met <a href="/wiki/Nancy_Spungen" id="w">Nancy Spungen</a>, a drug addict and occasional prostitute<sup id="_ref-nndb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nndb" title="">[30]</a></sup> from <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a> with a history of severe emotional problems.<sup id="_ref-popmatters_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-popmatters" title="">[27]</a></sup> Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional co-dependency between the couple alienated Vicious from the other members of the band. Rotten said: &#34;We did everything to get rid of Nancy. She was killing him. I was absolutely convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission. Only she didn&#39;t want to go alone. She wanted to take Sid with her. She was so utterly fucked up and evil.&#34;<sup id="_ref-jlydon_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jlydon" title="">[11]</a></sup> Sid Vicious debuted with the band at the Screen on the Green in London on <a href="/wiki/3_April" id="w">3 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1977" id="w">1977</a>. Later on, at a show in Holland, Rotten refused to come to a sound check. Ritchie claimed he knew all the words and promptly climbed up on stage and began to sing the songs. Malcom McLaren recalls this event in the Sex Pistols documentary &#39;Chaos: ExPistols&#39; that he was in tune, and could sing them, and had this amazing grace to him. McLaren stated that &#39;he should&#39;ve come at the right time, he missed his window of opportunity&#39;. This stage persona would be recognisable both on stage for the Pistols, and when he would pursue his short-lived solo career</p>

In January 1978 the Sex Pistols embarked on a US tour, consisting mainly of dates in America&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Deep_South" id="w">Deep South</a>. Though originally scheduled for December 1977, it was delayed due the US authorities reluctance to issue visas to band members with criminal records.<sup id="_ref-ffbio2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ffbio2" title="">[48]</a></sup> Though highly anticipated by fans and media, the tour was plagued by in-fighting,<sup id="_ref-ffbio2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ffbio2" title="">[48]</a></sup> poor planning and physically hostile audiences.<sup id="_ref-crock_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-crock" title="">[49]</a></sup> Malcolm McLaren has admitted that he purposely booked <a href="/wiki/Redneck" id="w">redneck</a> bars to create those hostile situations.<sup id="_ref-Blood_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blood" title="">[28]</a></sup> Over the course of the two-weeks, Vicious, by now chronically addicted to heroin,<sup id="_ref-Huey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Huey" title="">[50]</a></sup> 
began to live up to his stage name. According to Rotten: &#34;He finally had an audience of people who would behave with shock and horror. Sid was easily led by the nose.&#34;<sup id="_ref-jlydon_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jlydon" title="">[11]</a></sup> 
Early in the tour, Sid wandered off from his <a href="/wiki/Holiday_Inn" id="w">Holiday Inn</a> in <a href="/wiki/Memphis%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, looking for drugs.  He was found in a Memphis hospital with the words &#34;Gimme a fix&#34; self-carved in his chest with a razor.  During a concert in <a href="/wiki/San_Antonio" id="w">San Antonio</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a>, Vicious called the audience &#34;a bunch of faggots&#34;, before striking a member of the audience across the head with his bass guitar.<sup id="_ref-Huey_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Huey" title="">[50]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/Baton_Rouge" id="w">Baton Rouge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a>, he received simulated oral sex on stage, later declaring &#34;that’s the kind of girl I like&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Klein_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Klein" title="">[51]</a></sup> Suffering withdrawal symptoms from heroin, Vicious appeared onstage in <a href="/wiki/Dallas" id="w">Dallas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a>, with the words &#34;Gimme a Fix&#34; still cut into his chest, and spat blood at a female who had climbed on stage and punched him in the face.<sup id="_ref-jlydon_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jlydon" title="">[11]</a></sup> He was admitted to hospital later that night to treat injuries resulting from his wounds.

Rotten, meanwhile, suffering from flu<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> and coughing up blood, felt increasingly isolated and distanced from Cook and Jones,<sup id="_ref-jlydon_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jlydon" title="">[11]</a></sup> and disgusted by Vicious.<sup id="_ref-Robb_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Robb" title="">[6]</a></sup> At the final date at the <a href="/wiki/Winterland_Ballroom" id="w">Winterland</a>, <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco%2C_California" id="w">San Francisco</a>, on <a href="/wiki/14_January" id="w">14 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1978" id="w">1978</a> a disillusioned Rotten ended with an encore of a <a href="/wiki/The_Stooges" id="w">Stooges</a> cover, &#34;No Fun.&#34; Sneering at the audience, he exclaimed &#34;This is No Fun, at all&#34;, making clear his personal feelings about the gig, the band, and the audience.<sup id="_ref-jlydon_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jlydon" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Robb_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Robb" title="">[6]</a></sup>  After the performance Rotten asked the audience &#34;Ever get the feeling you&#39;ve been cheated?&#34; before throwing down his microphone and walking off stage.<sup id="_ref-Cooper_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cooper" title="">[53]</a></sup> He later observed: &#34;I hated the whole scenario. It was a farce. I felt cheated. Sid was completely out of his brains - just a waste of space. Malcolm wouldn&#39;t speak to me. But then he would turn around and tell Paul and Steve that the tension was all my fault because I wouldn&#39;t agree to anything. It was all very bitter and confusing.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Robb_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Robb" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/17_January" id="w">17 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1978" id="w">1978</a>, Rotten announced his departure from the Sex Pistols.<sup id="_ref-savage_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-savage" title="">[12]</a></sup> Vicious departed for <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>, while McLaren, Cook and Jones left for a working vacation in <a href="/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" id="w">Rio de Janeiro</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brazil" id="w">Brazil</a>, leaving Rotten in America without money or a plane ticket.

In Jamaica, Branson met with members of the band <a href="/wiki/Devo" id="w">Devo</a>, and tried to install Rotten as their lead singer.  Devo declined the offer. 
The Sex Pistols continued, briefly, with Cook, Jones and Vicious. Attempts were made at finding a new frontman, but the band ended up with all three members taking lead vocal turns with guest vocalists. The group did not perform live in the post-Rotten period, but the majority of the recordings from this time were later released.</p>

<p>After leaving the Pistols, Johnny Rotten reverted to his birth name of Lydon, and formed <a href="/wiki/Public_Image_Ltd" id="w">Public Image Ltd</a>, with former Clash member <a href="/wiki/Keith_Levene" id="w">Keith Levene</a> and school friend <a href="/wiki/Jah_Wobble" id="w">Jah Wobble</a>.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> The band went on to score a U.K. Top Ten hit with their debut single, 1978&#39;s &#34;Public Image&#34;, and in 1979 recorded the <a href="/wiki/Post_punk" id="w">post punk</a> classic <i><a href="/wiki/Metal_Box" id="w">Metal Box</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-simonR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-simonR" title="">[56]</a></sup> In 1978 Lydon initiated legal proceedings against McLaren and his management company, <i>Glitterbest</i>.

<p>Vicious relocated to New York, and with Spungen acting as his manager, began to perform as a solo artist.

Here&#39;s the Sex Pistols</i>.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> The album was re-issued on October 29 on heavy weight vinyl with a 7&#34; insert of &#34;Submission&#34; and a poster. Fans should have noticed that this is exactly the format used when the record was originally released on <a href="/wiki/October_28" id="w">October 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1977" id="w">1977</a>. The 7&#34; &#34;Submission&#34; was not included on the original track listing when the album was &#39;mistakenly&#39; released a week earlier than planned. A one-sided 7&#34; was added to the first 50,000 copies of the album. Also re-released were the band&#39;s four classic singles: &#34;Anarchy in the UK&#34;, &#34;God Save the Queen&#34;, &#34;Pretty Vacant&#34; and &#34;Holidays in the Sun&#34;. All were released throughout October on 7&#34; vinyl: &#34;Anarchy in the UK&#34; on October 1, &#34;God Save the Queen&#34; on October 8, &#34;Pretty Vacant&#34; on October 15 and &#34;Holidays in the Sun&#34; on October 29.</p> 
<p><i>Never Mind the Bollocks ... Here&#39;s the Sex Pistols</i> was made available in the U.S on <a href="/wiki/ITunes" id="w">iTunes</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_16" id="w">October 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> along with the newly recorded versions of &#34;Anarchy in the U.K.&#34; and &#34;Pretty Vacant&#34; from <i>Guitar Hero III</i>.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/October_30" id="w">October 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, the Sex Pistols performed on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno" id="w">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a></i>.

<p>The original lineup of Rotten, Jones, Matlock and Cook reunited for seven live shows, five at the <a href="/wiki/Carling_Academy_Brixton" id="w">Brixton Academy</a> in London between <a href="/wiki/8_November" id="w">8 November</a> and <a href="/wiki/14_November" id="w">14 November</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, one at the <a href="/wiki/MEN_Arena" id="w">MEN Arena</a> in Manchester on <a href="/wiki/17_November" id="w">17 November</a> and one at the <a href="/wiki/SECC" id="w">SECC</a> in Glasgow on <a href="/wiki/18_November" id="w">18 November</a> to celebrate the 30th anniversary of <i>Never Mind the Bollocks</i>.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup>  The tour has been officially called &#39;Holidays in the Sun 2007&#39;.

<p>After the Sex Pistols appearance on the infamous Bill Grundy <i>Today</i> show, their story appeared on the front of every national newspaper the next day.  The media later raved, &#34;The Sex Pistols sold more papers on Fleet Street than the armistice.&#34;<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" id="w">Rolling Stone</a></i> suggested the band, responding &#34;to the star trappings and complacency&#34; of mid-1970s rock, &#34;came to spark and personify one of the few truly critical moments in pop culture—the rise of punk&#34;.<sup id="_ref-thesexpistol_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thesexpistol" title="">[4]</a></sup> While they were not the first punk band, the Pistols&#39; <i>Never Mind the Bollocks</i> is a singular achievement within the punk movement and an important event in the history of popular music in general. It is regularly cited on lists of the greatest albums ever: in 2006 the album was voted no. 27 in <i><a href="/wiki/Q_(magazine)" id="w">Q Magazine</a>&#39;s</i> &#34;100 Greatest Albums Ever&#34;,<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup> while Rolling Stone listed it at 2 in its 1987 &#34;Top 100 Albums of the Last 20 Years&#34;.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup>  In 2004, <a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone_Magazine" id="w">Rolling Stone Magazine</a> ranked <a class="externallink" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7235474/58_the_sex_pistols/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7235474/58_the_sex_pistols/">The Sex Pistols</a><sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> #58 on their list of the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty/">100 Greatest Artists of All Time</a>.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>
<p>Their live performances were also influential. A significant show occurred early in their career on <a href="/wiki/June_4" id="w">June 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a>, when they performed to a crowd of just 42 people at the <a href="/wiki/Free_Trade_Hall" id="w">Lesser Free Trade Hall</a> in <a href="/wiki/Manchester" id="w">Manchester</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>. It was to become one of the most important and mythologized events in rock history.<sup id="_ref-trade_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trade" title="">[82]</a></sup> Among the audience were many who would later form bands or otherwise popularise the embryonic punk movement, including the <a href="/wiki/Buzzcocks" id="w">Buzzcocks</a> (who had organised the gig), <a href="/wiki/Anthony_H._Wilson" id="w">Anthony H.

<p>The Sex Pistols are remembered for communicating directly with their audiences. According to Lydon: &#34;If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time.&#34;<sup id="_ref-plastic_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-plastic" title="">[58]</a></sup> Whether the Pistols&#39; anti-establishment stance was spontaneous or cultivated has been debated. One reviewer notes that &#34;England&#39;s depressed social psyche at the time&#34; was enough to generate a band like the Pistols and that Rotten&#39;s &#34;fierce intelligence and astonishing onstage charisma&#34; were important catalysts, but ultimately credits McLaren&#39;s history-minded manipulations as the real power behind the band.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup> Bands who have been influenced by the Sex Pistols include <a href="/wiki/The_Clash" id="w">The Clash</a>,<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/The_Offspring" id="w">The Offspring</a>,<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Siouxsie_%26amp%3B_the_Banshees" id="w">Siouxsie &#38; the Banshees</a>,<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Nirvana_(band)" id="w">Nirvana</a>,<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/NOFX" id="w">NOFX</a><sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup>, <a href="/wiki/Oasis_(band)" id="w">Oasis</a>,<sup id="_ref-nvm_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nvm" title="">[42]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/The_Fall_(band)" id="w">The Fall</a>,<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Green_Day" id="w">Green Day</a>,<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Guns_N%26%2339%3B_Roses" id="w">Guns N&#39; Roses</a>.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup> </p>
