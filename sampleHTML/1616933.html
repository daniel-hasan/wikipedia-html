The <b>music history of the United States</b> includes many styles of <a href="/wiki/American_roots_music" id="w">folk</a>, <a href="/wiki/American_popular_music" id="w">popular</a> and <a href="/wiki/American_classical_music" id="w">classical</a> music.  Some of the most well-known genres of American music are <a href="/wiki/Blues" id="w">blues</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" id="w">rock and roll</a>, <a href="/wiki/Country_music" id="w">country</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_music" id="w">hip hop</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jazz" id="w">jazz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gospel_music" id="w">gospel</a>.  American music history began with the <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native Americans</a>, the first people to populate <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a>.  The music of these people was highly varied in form, and was mostly religious in purpose.</p>
<p>With the arrival of large numbers of colonizers from European countries like <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">Great Britain</a>.  These people brought <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christian</a> <a href="/wiki/Choir" id="w">choirs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Musical_notation" id="w">musical notation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Broadside_(music)" id="w">broadsides</a>, as well as large numbers of <a href="/wiki/West_Africa" id="w">West African</a> <a href="/wiki/Slavery" id="w">slaves</a>.  These <a href="/wiki/African_American" id="w">African Americans</a> played a variety of instruments, especially including <a href="/wiki/Drums" id="w">drums</a> and <a href="/wiki/String_instrument" id="w">string instruments</a> similar to the <a href="/wiki/Guitar" id="w">guitar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Banjo" id="w">banjo</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Polyrhythm" id="w">polyrhythms</a> and <a href="/wiki/Call-and-response" id="w">call-and-response</a> style vocals.</p>
<p>As the United States incorporated more lands,spreading west towards the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a>, a number of immigrants began to arrive in the country, bringing with them their own instruments and styles.  During this time, the United States grew to incorporate the <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Louisiana" id="w">Cajun and Creole music</a> of <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Polynesia" id="w">Polynesian</a> <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Hawaii" id="w">music of Hawaii</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tejano_music" id="w">Tex-Mex and Tejano music</a>.  Immigrants brought with them the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Europe" id="w">Eastern European</a> <a href="/wiki/Polka" id="w">polka</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_China" id="w">Chinese</a> and <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> music<a href="/wiki/Ukraine" id="w">Ukrainian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Polish</a> <a href="/wiki/Fiddle" id="w">fiddling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Scotland" id="w">Scottish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Ireland" id="w">Irish music</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ashkenazi" id="w">Ashkenazi</a> <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jewish</a> <a href="/wiki/Klezmer" id="w">klezmer</a>, and other styles of <a href="/wiki/Music_of_India" id="w">Indian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Russia" id="w">Russian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_France" id="w">French</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Germany" id="w">German</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Italy" id="w">Italian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arab_music" id="w">Arab</a> and <a href="/wiki/Latin_music" id="w">Latin music</a>.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, American popular music has achieved great international acclaim.  Even since the <a href="/wiki/Ragtime" id="w">ragtime</a> and <a href="/wiki/Minstrel" id="w">minstrel</a> songs of the 19th century, <a href="/wiki/African_American_music" id="w">African American music</a> has remained at the heart of American popular music.  The rural <a href="/wiki/Blues" id="w">blues</a> of poor black Southerners and the <a href="/wiki/Jazz" id="w">jazz</a> of black urbanites were among the earliest styles of American popular music.  At the time, black performers typically did not perform their own material, instead using songs produced by the music publishing companies of <a href="/wiki/Tin_Pan_Alley" id="w">Tin Pan Alley</a>.  African American blues evolved during the 20th century, mixing with <a href="/wiki/Appalachian_folk_music" id="w">Appalachian folk music</a> and other styles to create genres like <a href="/wiki/Country_music" id="w">country music</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues" id="w">rhythm and blues</a>.  During this time, jazz diversified into steadily more experimental fields.  By the end of the 1940s, jazz had grown into such varied fields as <a href="/wiki/Bebop" id="w">bebop</a> and <a href="/wiki/Swing_music" id="w">swing</a>.</p>
<p>Rock and roll was soon to become the most important component of American popular music, beginning with the <a href="/wiki/Rockabilly" id="w">rockabilly</a> boom of the 1950s.  In the following decade, <a href="/wiki/Gospel_music" id="w">gospel</a> evolved into secular <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" id="w">soul</a>.  Rock, country and soul, mixed with each other and occasionally other styles, spawned a legion of subgenres over the next few days, ranging from <a href="/wiki/Heavy_metal_music" id="w">heavy metal</a> to <a href="/wiki/Punk_rock" id="w">punk</a> and <a href="/wiki/Funk" id="w">funk</a>.  In the 1970s, urban African Americans in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> began performing spoken lyrics over a beat provided by an <a href="/wiki/Emcee" id="w">emcee</a>; this became known as <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_music" id="w">hip hop music</a>.  By the dawn of the 21st century, hip hop had become a part of most recorded American popular music.</p>
<a id="American_roots_music" name="American_roots_music"></a><h2>American roots music</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The first musicians anywhere in North America were <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native Americans</a>, who consist of hundreds of <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_group" id="w">ethnic groups</a> across the country, each with their own unique styles of <a href="/wiki/Folk_music" id="w">folk music</a>.  Of these cultures, many, and their musical traditions, are now extinct, though some remain relatively vibrant in a modern form, such as <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Hawaii" id="w">Hawaiian music</a>.  </p>
<p>By the 16th century, large-scale <a href="/wiki/Immigration" id="w">immigration</a> of <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spanish</a> settlers brought new kinds of folk music.  This was followed by the importation of <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africans</a> as <a href="/wiki/Slavery" id="w">slaves</a>, bringing their music with them.  The Africans were as culturally varied as the Native Americans, descended from hundreds of ethnic groups in <a href="/wiki/West_Africa" id="w">West Africa</a>.  American music is, like most of its hemispheric neighbors, a mixture African, European and native influences.  Still later in the country&#39;s history, ethnic and musical diversity grew as the United States grew into a melting pot of different peoples.  Immigration from <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> began in large numbers in the 19th century, most of them settling on the West Coast.  Later, <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japanese</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">Indian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scottish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Polish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Irish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexican</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Swedish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" id="w">Ukrainian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Armenia" id="w">Armenian</a> immigrants also arrived in large numbers.</p>
<a id="African_American_music" name="African_American_music"></a><h3>African American music</h3>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>In the 19th century, African-Americans were freed from <a href="/wiki/Slavery" id="w">slavery</a> following the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>.  The music of these slaves was primarily African in origin, displaying <a href="/wiki/Polyrhythm" id="w">polyrhythm</a> and other distinctly African traits.  <a href="/wiki/Work_song" id="w">Work songs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Field_holler" id="w">field hollers</a> were popular, but it was <a href="/wiki/Spiritual_(music)" id="w">spirituals</a> which became a major foundation for music in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Spirituals (or <i>Negro spirituals</i>, as they were then known) were Christian songs, dominated by passionate and earthy vocals, which were performed in an African-style <a href="/wiki/Call_and_response_(music)" id="w">call-and-response</a> format using hymns derived from those sung in colonial New England choirs, which were based on Moravian, English and Dutch church music.  These hymns spread south through <a href="/wiki/Appalachia" id="w">Appalachia</a> in the late 18th century, where they were partnered with the music of the African slaves.  During the <a href="/wiki/Great_Awakening" id="w">Great Awakening</a> of religious fervor in the early 19th century, spirituals spread across the south.  Among some whites, slave music grew increasingly popular, especially after the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>, when black and white soldiers worked together and Southern slaves fled north in huge numbers.</p>
<p>By the end of the century, <a href="/wiki/Minstrel" id="w">minstrel</a> shows had spread across the country, and even to continental Europe.  In minstrel shows, performers imitated slaves in crude caricatures, singing and dancing to what was called &#34;Negro music&#34;, though it had little in common with authentic African American folk styles.  An African American variety of dance music called the <a href="/wiki/Cakewalk" id="w">cakewalk</a> also became popular, evolving into <a href="/wiki/Ragtime" id="w">ragtime</a> by the turn of the century.</p>
<a id="Appalachian_folk_music" name="Appalachian_folk_music"></a><h3>Appalachian folk music</h3>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains" id="w">Appalachian Mountains</a> run along the East Coast of the United States.  The region has long been historically poor compared to much of the rest of the country; many of the rural Appalachian people travelled to cities for work, and were there labeled <i><a href="/wiki/Hillbilly" id="w">hillbillies</a></i>, and their music became known as <i>hillbilly music</i>.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants arrived in large numbers.  They mingled there with poor whites of other ethnic backgrounds, as well as many blacks.  The result was a diverse array of folk styles which have been collectively referred to as <a href="/wiki/Appalachian_folk_music" id="w">Appalachian folk music</a>.  These styles included <a href="/wiki/Jug_band" id="w">jug bands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Honky_tonk" id="w">honky tonk</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bluegrass_music" id="w">bluegrass</a>, and are the root of modern <a href="/wiki/Country_music" id="w">country music</a>.</p>
<p>Appalachian folk music began its evolution towards pop-country in 1927, when <a href="/wiki/Jimmie_Rodgers" id="w">Jimmie Rodgers</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Carter_Family" id="w">Carter Family</a> began recording in a historic session with <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Peer" id="w">Ralph Peer</a> (Barraclough and Wolff, 537).  Rodgers sang often morbid lyrical themes that drew on the blues to create tales of the poor and unlucky (Collins, 11), while the Carters preferred more upbeat ballads with clear vocals, complementary instrumentation and wholesome lyrics (Garofalo, 53).  Their success paved the way for the development of popular country, and left its mark on the developing genre of <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" id="w">rock and roll</a>.</p>
<a id="Other_forms_of_American_roots_music" name="Other_forms_of_American_roots_music"></a><h3>Other forms of American roots music</h3>

<p>Though Appalachian and African American folk music became the basis for most of American popular music, the United States is home to a diverse assortment of ethnic groups.  In the early 20th century, many of these ethnic groups supported niche record industries and produced minor folk stars like <a href="/wiki/Pawlo_Humeniuk" id="w">Pawlo Humeniuk</a>, the &#34;King of the Ukrainian Fiddlers&#34; (Kochan and Kytasty, 308).  Some of these ethnic musicians eventually became well-known across the country, such as <a href="/wiki/Frankie_Yankovic" id="w">Frankie Yankovic</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Slovenia" id="w">Slovenian</a> <a href="/wiki/Polka" id="w">polka</a> master.</p>
<p>This same period also saw the rise of <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native American</a> <a href="/wiki/Powwow" id="w">powwows</a> around the turn of the century.  These were large-scale inter-tribal events featuring spiritual activity and musical performances, mostly group percussion based (Means, 594).</p>
<p>Large-scale immigration of <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Europe" id="w">Eastern European</a> <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jews</a> and their <a href="/wiki/Klezmer" id="w">klezmer</a> music peaked in the first few decades of the 20th century.  People like <a href="/wiki/Harry_Kandel" id="w">Harry Kandel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dave_Tarras" id="w">Dave Tarras</a> become stars within their niche, and made the United States the international center for klezmer (Broughton, 583).</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a>, ethnic <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexicans</a> who had lived in the area for centuries, played a distinct style of <a href="/wiki/Conjunto" id="w">conjunto</a>, different from that played in Mexico.  The influence of <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic" id="w">Czech</a> <a href="/wiki/Polka" id="w">polka</a> music was a major distinguishing characteristic of this music, which gradually evolved into what is now known as <a href="/wiki/Norte%C3%B1o_(music)" id="w">norteño</a> (Burr, 604).</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Cajun" id="w">Cajuns</a> and <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_Creole_people" id="w">Creoles</a> of <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a> have long constituted a distinct minority with their own cultural identity.  The Cajuns are descendants of <a href="/wiki/French-Canadian" id="w">French-Canadians</a> from the region of <a href="/wiki/Acadia" id="w">Acadia</a>, the Creoles are black and <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>-speaking.  Their music was a mixture of bluesy work songs mixed with jazz and other influences, and included styles like <a href="/wiki/La_la" id="w">la la</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jur%C3%A9" id="w">juré</a>.  Though these genres were geographically limited, they were modernized and mixed with more mainstream styles, evolving into popular <a href="/wiki/Zydeco" id="w">zydeco</a> music by the middle of the century (Broughton and Kaliss, 558).</p>
<a id="Popular_music" name="Popular_music"></a><h2>Popular music</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The first field of American music that could be viewed as <a href="/wiki/Popular_music" id="w">popular</a>, rather than <a href="/wiki/European_classical_music" id="w">classical</a> or <a href="/wiki/Folk_music" id="w">folk</a>, was the singing of the colonial New England choirs, and travelling singing masters like <a href="/wiki/William_Billings" id="w">William Billings</a>.  It was here that techniques and traditions like <a href="/wiki/Shape_note" id="w">shape note</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lining_out" id="w">lined-out hymnody</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sacred_Harp" id="w">Sacred Harp</a> were created, gradually spreading south and becoming an integral part of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Awakening" id="w">Great Awakening</a>.  The Great Awakening was a period of religious fervor, among whites and blacks (both slave and free), that saw passionate, evangelical &#34;<a href="/wiki/Negro_spirituals" id="w">Negro spirituals</a>&#34; grow in popularity (Ferris, 98).</p>
<p>During the 19th century, it was not spirituals that gained truly widespread acclaim, but rather peppy comic songs performed by <a href="/wiki/Minstrel" id="w">minstrels</a> in <a href="/wiki/Blackface" id="w">blackface</a>, and written by legendary songwriters like <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Foster" id="w">Stephen Foster</a> and <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Emmett" id="w">Daniel Emmett</a>.  During the Civil War, popular ballads were common, some used liberally by both the North and the South as patriotic songs.  Finally, late in the century, the African American <a href="/wiki/Cakewalk" id="w">cakewalk</a> evolved into <a href="/wiki/Ragtime" id="w">ragtime</a>, which became a North American and European sensation, while mainstream America was enthralled by the brass band marches of <a href="/wiki/John_Philips_Sousa" id="w">John Philips Sousa</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Tin_Pan_Alley" id="w">Tin Pan Alley</a> was the biggest source of <a href="/wiki/Popular_music" id="w">popular music</a> early in the 20th century (Garofolo, 17).  Tin Pan Alley was a place in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> which published <a href="/wiki/Sheet_music" id="w">sheet music</a> for dance songs like &#34;After the Ball Is Over&#34;.  The first few decades of the 20th century also saw the rise of popular, comic <a href="/wiki/Musical_theater" id="w">musical theater</a>, such as the <a href="/wiki/Vaudeville" id="w">vaudeville</a> tradition and composers and writers like <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Hammerstein_II" id="w">Oscar Hammerstein II</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jerome_Kern" id="w">Jerome Kern</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ira_Gershwin" id="w">Ira Gershwin</a>.  At the same time, <a href="/wiki/Jazz" id="w">jazz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Blues" id="w">blues</a>, two distinct but related genres, began flourishing in cities like <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans" id="w">New Orleans</a> and began to attract some mainstream audiences.</p>
<p>Blues and jazz were the foundation of what became American popular music.  The ability to sell recorded music through <a href="/wiki/Phonograph" id="w">phonographs</a> changed the music industry into one that relied on the charisma of star performers rather than songwriters.  There was increased pressure to record bigger hits, meaning that even minor trends and fads like <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" id="w">Hawaiian</a> <a href="/wiki/Steel_guitar" id="w">steel guitar</a> left a permanent influence (the steel guitar is still very common in <a href="/wiki/Country_music" id="w">country music</a>).  <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" id="w">Dominican</a> <a href="/wiki/Merengue_music" id="w">merengue</a> and <a href="/wiki/Argentina" id="w">Argentinian</a> <a href="/wiki/Tango_music" id="w">tango</a> also left their mark, especially on jazz, which has long been a part of the music scene in Latin America.  During the 1920s, <a href="/wiki/Classic_female_blues" id="w">classic female blues</a> singers like <a href="/wiki/Mamie_Smith" id="w">Mamie Smith</a> became the first musical celebrities of national renown.  <a href="/wiki/Gospel_music" id="w">Gospel</a>, blues and jazz were also diversifying during this period, with new subgenres evolving in different cities like New York, New Orleans and Chicago.</p>

<p>Jazz quickly replaced the blues as American popular music, in the form of <a href="/wiki/Big_band" id="w">big band</a> <a href="/wiki/Swing_music" id="w">swing</a>, a kind of <a href="/wiki/Dance_music" id="w">dance music</a> from the early 1930s.  Swing used large ensembles, and was not generally improvised, in contrast with the free-flowing form of other kinds of jazz.  With swing spreading across the nation, other genres continued to evolve towards popular traditions.  In Louisiana, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Louisiana" id="w">Cajun and Creole music</a> was adding influences from <a href="/wiki/Blues" id="w">blues</a> and generating some regional hit records, while <a href="/wiki/Appalachian_folk_music" id="w">Appalachian folk music</a> was spawning <a href="/wiki/Jug_band" id="w">jug bands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Honky_tonk" id="w">honky tonk</a> bars and <a href="/wiki/Close_harmony_duet" id="w">close harmony duets</a>, which were to evolve into the pop-folk of the 1940s, bluegrass and country.</p>
<a id="1940s_and_1950s" name="1940s_and_1950s"></a><h2>1940s and 1950s</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>In the 1940s, blues became the basis for <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" id="w">rock and roll</a>, while jazz evolved into an ever more experimental <a href="/wiki/Bebop" id="w">bebop</a> scene.  Country and folk music further developed as well, gaining newfound popularity and acclaim for hard-edged <a href="/wiki/Folk_music" id="w">folk music</a>.  Perhaps most importantly, the 1940s saw the rise of the youth culture.  Teenagers from across the country began to identify with each other and launched numerous trends.  The first <a href="/wiki/Teen_idol" id="w">teen stars</a> arose, beginning with the <a href="/wiki/Bobby_soxer" id="w">bobby soxer</a> idol <a href="/wiki/Frank_Sinatra" id="w">Frank Sinatra</a>; this opened up new audiences for popular music, which had been primarily an adult phenomenon prior to the 40s.</p>
<a id="Roots_of_country_music" name="Roots_of_country_music"></a><h3>Roots of country music</h3>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The early 1940s saw the first major commercial success for Appalachian folk.  Singers like <a href="/wiki/Pete_Seeger" id="w">Pete Seeger</a> emerged, in groups like the <a href="/wiki/Almanac_Singers" id="w">Almanac Singers</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Weavers" id="w">The Weavers</a>.  Lyrically, these performers drew on early <a href="/wiki/Singer-songwriter" id="w">singer-songwriters</a> like <a href="/wiki/Woody_Guthrie" id="w">Woody Guthrie</a>, and the whole scene became gradually associated with the political left (Garofolo, 196).  By the 1950s, the anti-Communism scare was in full swing, and some performers with a liberal or <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialist</a> bent were blacklisted from the music industry.</p>
<p>In the middle of the 40s, <a href="/wiki/Western_swing" id="w">Western swing</a> reached its peak of popularity.  It was a mixture of diverse influences, including <a href="/wiki/Swing_music" id="w">swing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Blues" id="w">blues</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polka" id="w">polka</a> and popular <a href="/wiki/Cowboy_song" id="w">cowboy songs</a>, and included early stars like <a href="/wiki/Bob_Wills" id="w">Bob Wills</a>, who became among the best known musicians of the era.</p>
<p>With a honky tonk root, modern <a href="/wiki/Country_music" id="w">country music</a> arose in the 1940s, mixing with <a href="/wiki/R%26amp%3BB" id="w">R&#38;B</a> and the blues to form <a href="/wiki/Rockabilly" id="w">rockabilly</a>.  Rockabilly&#39;s earliest stars were <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" id="w">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bill_Haley" id="w">Bill Haley</a>, who entertained to crowds of devoted teenage fans.  At the time, black audiences were listening to R&#38;B, doo wop and gospel, but these styles were not perceived as appropriate for white listeners.  People like Haley and Presley were white, but sang in a black style.  This caused a great deal of controversy from concerned parents who felt that &#34;race music&#34;, as it was then known, would corrupt their children.  Nevertheless, rockabilly&#39;s popularity continued to grow, paving the way for the earliest rock stars like <a href="/wiki/Chuck_Berry" id="w">Chuck Berry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Little_Richard" id="w">Little Richard</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fats_Domino" id="w">Fats Domino</a>.</p>
<p>Among country fans, rockabilly was not well-regarded.  Instead, the pop sounds of singers like <a href="/wiki/Hank_Williams" id="w">Hank Williams</a> and <a href="/wiki/Patsy_Cline" id="w">Patsy Cline</a> became popular.  Williams had an unprecedented run of success, with more than ten chart-topping singles in two years (1950-1951), including well-remembered songs still performed today like &#34;<a href="/wiki/I%26%2339%3Bm_So_Lonesome_I_Could_Cry" id="w">I&#39;m So Lonesome I Could Cry</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Cold%2C_Cold_Heart" id="w">Cold, Cold Heart</a>&#34;.  It was performers like Williams that established the city of <a href="/wiki/Nashville%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Nashville, Tennessee</a> as the center of the country music industry.  There, country and pop were mixed, resulting in what was known as the <a href="/wiki/Nashville_Sound" id="w">Nashville Sound</a>.</p>

<p><i>Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Gospel_music" id="w">Gospel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Doo_wop" id="w">doo wop</a></i></p>
<p>The 1950s also saw the widespread popularization of <a href="/wiki/Gospel_music" id="w">gospel music</a>, in the form of powerful singers like <a href="/wiki/Mahalia_Jackson" id="w">Mahalia Jackson</a>.  Gospel first broke into international audiences in 1948, with the release of Jackson&#39;s &#34;Move On Up a Little Higher&#34;, which was so popular it couldn&#39;t be shipped to record stores fast enough.  As the music became more mainstream in the later part of the decade, performers began adding influences from <a href="/wiki/R%26amp%3BB" id="w">R&#38;B</a> to make a more palatable and dance-able sound.  Early in the next decade, the lyrics were secularized, resulting in <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" id="w">soul music</a>.  Some of soul&#39;s biggest stars began performing in the 50s gospel scene, including <a href="/wiki/Sam_Cooke" id="w">Sam Cooke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dinah_Washington" id="w">Dinah Washington</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dionne_Warwick" id="w">Dionne Warwick</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aretha_Franklin" id="w">Aretha Franklin</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Doo_wop" id="w">Doo wop</a>, a complex type of vocal music, also became popular during the 1950s, and left its mark on 1960s soul and R&#38;B.  The genre&#39;s exact origins are debatable, but it drew on groups like the <a href="/wiki/Mills_Brothers" id="w">Mills Brothers</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Ink_Spots" id="w">The Ink Spots</a>, who played a kind of R&#38;B with smooth, alternating lead vocals.  With the addition of gospel inflections, doo wop&#39;s polished sound and romantic ballads made it a major part of the 50s music scene, beginning in 1951.  The first popular groups were <a href="/wiki/The_Five_Keys" id="w">The Five Keys</a> (&#34;Glory Of Love&#34;) and <a href="/wiki/The_Flamingos" id="w">The Flamingos</a> (&#34;Golden Teardrops&#34;). Doo wop diversified considerably later in the decade, with groups like [[The Crows] (&#34;Gee&#34;), creating a style of <a href="/wiki/Uptempo_doo_wop" id="w">uptempo doo wop</a> and the ballad style via <a href="/wiki/The_Penguins" id="w">The Penguins</a> (&#34;Earth Angel&#34;), while singers like <a href="/wiki/Frankie_Lymon" id="w">Frankie Lymon</a> became sensations; Lymon became the first black teen idol in the country&#39;s history after the release of the Top 40 pop hit &#34;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&#34; (1956).</p>

<p>The first Mexican-Texan pop star was <a href="/wiki/Lydia_Mendoza" id="w">Lydia Mendoza</a>, who began recording in 1934.  It was not until the 40s, however, that <a href="/wiki/Musica_norte%C3%B1a" id="w">musica norteña</a> became popularized by female duets like <a href="/wiki/Carmen_y_Laura" id="w">Carmen y Laura</a> and <a href="/wiki/Las_Hermanas_Mendoza" id="w">Las Hermanas Mendoza</a>, who had a string of regional hits.  The following decade saw the rise of <a href="/wiki/Chelo_Silva" id="w">Chelo Silva</a>, known as the &#34;Queen of the (Mexican) <a href="/wiki/Bolero" id="w">Bolero</a>&#34;, who sang romantic pop songs.</p>
<p>The 50s saw further innovation in the Mexican-Texan community, as electric guitars, drums and elements of rock and jazz were added to <a href="/wiki/Conjunto" id="w">conjunto</a>.  <a href="/wiki/Valeria_Longoria" id="w">Valeria Longoria</a> was the first major performer of conjunto, known for introducing Colombian <a href="/wiki/Cumbia" id="w">cumbia</a> and Mexican <a href="/wiki/Ranchera" id="w">ranchera</a> to conjunto bands.

<p>Louisiana&#39;s Cajun and Creole communities saw their local music become a brief mainstream fad during the 1950s.  This was largely due to the work of <a href="/wiki/Clifton_Chenier" id="w">Clifton Chenier</a>, who began recording for <a href="/wiki/Speciality_Records" id="w">Speciality Records</a> in 1955.

The beginning of the decade saw the peak of doo wop&#39;s popularity, in about 1961, as well as the rise of <a href="/wiki/Surf_music" id="w">surf</a>, <a href="/wiki/Girl_group" id="w">girl groups</a> and the first <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" id="w">soul</a> singers.  <a href="/wiki/Psychedelic_rock" id="w">Psychedelic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Progressive_rock" id="w">progressive rock</a> arose during this period, along with the roots of what would later become <a href="/wiki/Funk" id="w">funk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_music" id="w">hip hop</a>, <a href="/wiki/Salsa_music" id="w">salsa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electronic_music" id="w">electronic music</a>, <a href="/wiki/Punk_rock" id="w">punk rock</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heavy_metal_music" id="w">heavy metal</a>.  An American <a href="/wiki/Roots_revival" id="w">roots revival</a> occurred simultaneously as a period of sexual liberation and racial conflict, leading to growth in the lyrical maturity and complexity of popular music as songwriters wrote about the changes the country was going through.</p>
<a id="Early_1960s" name="Early_1960s"></a><h3>Early 1960s</h3>

<p>The first few years of the 1960s saw major innovation in <a href="/wiki/Popular_music" id="w">popular music</a>.  <a href="/wiki/Girl_group" id="w">Girl groups</a>, <a href="/wiki/Surf_music" id="w">surf</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hot_rod_music" id="w">hot rod</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Nashville_Sound" id="w">Nashville Sound</a> were popular, while an Appalachian folk and African American blues <a href="/wiki/Roots_revival" id="w">roots revival</a> became dominant among a smaller portion of the listening audience.  An even larger population of young audiences in the United Kingdom listened to American blues.  By the middle of the decade, <a href="/wiki/British_blues" id="w">British blues</a> and <a href="/wiki/R%26amp%3BB" id="w">R&#38;B</a> bands like <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles" id="w">The Beatles</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Who" id="w">The Who</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stones" id="w">Rolling Stones</a> were topping the charts in what became known as the <a href="/wiki/British_Invasion" id="w">British Invasion</a>, alongside newly-secularized <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" id="w">soul music</a> and the mainstreaming of the <a href="/wiki/Bakersfield_Sound" id="w">Bakersfield Sound</a>.

<a id="Psychedelic_rock" name="Psychedelic_rock"></a><h3>Psychedelic rock</h3>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Psychedelic rock became the genre most closely intertwined with the youth culture.  It arose from the British Invasion of blues in the middle of the decade, when bands like <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles" id="w">The Beatles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stones" id="w">Rolling Stones</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Who" id="w">The Who</a> dominated the charts and only a few American bands, such as <a href="/wiki/The_Beach_Boys" id="w">The Beach Boys</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Mamas_%26amp%3B_the_Papas" id="w">The Mamas &#38; the Papas</a>, could compete.

<p>Later in the decade, psychedelic rock and the youth culture splintered.  <a href="/wiki/Punk_rock" id="w">Punk rock</a>, <a href="/wiki/Heavy_metal_music" id="w">heavy metal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Singer-songwriter" id="w">singer-songwriter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Progressive_rock" id="w">progressive rock</a> appeared, and the connection between music and social activism largely disappeared from popular music.</p>

<p><i>Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" id="w">Soul</a> and <a href="/wiki/Funk" id="w">funk</a></i>

Influenced by psychedelic rock, which was dominating the charts at the time, funk was a very rhythmic, dance-able kind of soul.  Later in the decade and into the 70s, funk too split into two strands.  <a href="/wiki/Sly_%26amp%3B_the_Family_Stone" id="w">Sly &#38; the Family Stone</a> made pop-funk palatable for the masses, while <a href="/wiki/George_Clinton_(funk_musician)" id="w">George Clinton</a> and his <a href="/wiki/P_Funk" id="w">P Funk</a> collective pioneered a new, psychedelia- and heavy metal-influenced form of avant-garde funk.  <a href="/wiki/Album-oriented_soul" id="w">Album-oriented soul</a> also appeared very late in the decade and into the next, with artists like <a href="/wiki/Marvin_Gaye" id="w">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href="/wiki/Al_Green" id="w">Al Green</a> and <a href="/wiki/Curtis_Mayfield" id="w">Curtis Mayfield</a> taking soul beyond the realm of the single into cohesive album-length artistic statements with a complex social conscience.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Alanis_Morissette" id="w">Alanis Morissette</a>, one of the top-selling artist of the 90s, injected renewed popularity to singer-songwriters such as <a href="/wiki/Tori_Amos" id="w">Tori Amos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jewel_(singer)" id="w">Jewel</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sarah_MacLachlan" id="w">Sarah MacLachlan</a>. In the wake of grunge and gangsta rap came a fusion of soul and hip hop, called <a href="/wiki/Nu_soul" id="w">nu soul</a>, some popularity for British <a href="/wiki/Britpop" id="w">Britpop</a> and the rise of bands like <a href="/wiki/Sublime_(band)" id="w">Sublime</a> and <a href="/wiki/No_Doubt" id="w">No Doubt</a>, playing a form of pop punk influenced by Jamaican <a href="/wiki/Ska" id="w">ska</a> and British <a href="/wiki/Two_tone" id="w">two tone</a> ska/punk fusionists from the early 80s.  <a href="/wiki/Techno_music" id="w">Techno</a> also became popular, though nowhere&#39;s near as much so as in most of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>At the turn of the millennium, <a href="/wiki/Bubblegum_pop" id="w">bubblegum pop</a> groups like <a href="/wiki/Backstreet_Boys" id="w">Backstreet Boys</a> and <a href="/wiki/Britney_Spears" id="w">Britney Spears</a> were dominating the charts, many of them with a Latin beat (<a href="/wiki/Shakira" id="w">Shakira</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ricky_Martin" id="w">Ricky Martin</a>), and rappers like <a href="/wiki/Jay-Z" id="w">Jay-Z</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eminem" id="w">Eminem</a> were huge stars.  Some <a href="/wiki/Garage_rock" id="w">garage rock</a> revivalists like <a href="/wiki/The_White_Stripes" id="w">The White Stripes</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Hives" id="w">The Hives</a> became highly-hyped bands in the <a href="/wiki/Indie_rock" id="w">indie rock</a> field, and achieved substantial mainstream success.  The first few years of the 2000s saw the further rise of pop-hip hop, fed by the breakthrough success of Eminem.  Indeed, hip hop became an essential element of nearly all popular music during this period, resulting in new fusions like <a href="/wiki/Nu_metal" id="w">nu metal</a>.  Pop thug rappers like <a href="/wiki/Ja_Rule" id="w">Ja Rule</a> were nationally renowned, though hard-edged hip made a return within a few years with the rise of <a href="/wiki/50_Cent" id="w">50 Cent</a>.</p>
