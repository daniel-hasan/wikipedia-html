The <b>Battle of Stillman&#39;s Run</b>, also known as the <b>Battle of Sycamore Creek</b> or the <b>Battle of Old Man&#39;s Creek</b>, occurred on <a href="/wiki/May_14" id="w">May 14</a> <a href="/wiki/1832" id="w">1832</a>. The battle was named for Major <a href="/wiki/Isaiah_Stillman" id="w">Isaiah Stillman</a> and his detachment of 275 Illinois militia which fled in a panic from around 50 of <a href="/wiki/Sauk" id="w">Sauk</a> warriors. The engagement was the first battle of the 1832 <a href="/wiki/Black_Hawk_War" id="w">Black Hawk War</a> which had ignited after Black Hawk crossed the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a> into Illinois with his &#34;British Band&#34; of Sauk and <a href="/wiki/Fox_(tribe)" id="w">Fox</a>. Following a failed attempt at truce negotiations by emissaries sent by Black Hawk, the disorganized militia pursued a group of Sauk scouts back to the main British Band camp. </p>
<p>During the engagement 12 militia men were killed while making a stand on a small hill. The rest of the militia fled back to <a href="/wiki/Dixon%26%2339%3Bs_Ferry" id="w">Dixon&#39;s Ferry</a> where they spread news of a terrible slaughter at Stillman&#39;s Run. It is believed that militia volunteer <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" id="w">Abraham Lincoln</a> helped bury the dead at the battlefield following the fight, this claim, however, was still under investigation as of 2003. An article published in 2006 corroborated Lincoln&#39;s presence at the burial; though there is little agreement amongst various other sources. In 1901 a monument was erected in <a href="/wiki/Stillman_Valley%2C_Illinois" id="w">Stillman Valley, Illinois</a> commemorating the battle.</p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h1>Background</h1>
<p>Angered by the loss of his birthplace via prior disputed treaties, <a href="/wiki/Black_Hawk" id="w">Black Hawk</a> led a number of incursions across the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a> beginning in 1830. Each time, he was persuaded to return west without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliances with other tribes and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a>, he again moved his &#34;<a href="/wiki/British_Band" id="w">British Band</a>&#34;<sup id="_ref-brit_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brit" title="">[1]</a></sup> into <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a>.<sup id="_ref-lewis_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lewis" title="">[2]</a></sup> Finding no allies, he attempted to return to <a href="/wiki/Iowa" id="w">Iowa</a>, but ensuing events led to the Battle of Stillman&#39;s Run.<sup id="_ref-wiscsr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wiscsr" title="">[3]</a></sup> A number of other engagements followed, and the state <a href="/wiki/Militia" id="w">militias</a> of <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin" id="w">Wisconsin</a> and Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk&#39;s band. The conflict became known as the <a href="/wiki/Black_Hawk_War" id="w">Black Hawk War</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_5" id="w">April 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1832" id="w">1832</a>, Black Hawk and around 1,000 warriors and civilians recrossed the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a> into Illinois in an attempt to reclaim their land. About half of Black Hawk&#39;s band were combatants and the rest were a combination of women, children, and elderly. The band consisted of <a href="/wiki/Sauk" id="w">Sauk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fox" id="w">Fox</a>, some <a href="/wiki/Potawatomi" id="w">Potawatomi</a>, and some <a href="/wiki/Kickapoo" id="w">Kickapoo</a>; in addition some members of the <a href="/wiki/Ho-Chunk" id="w">Ho-Chunk</a> nation were sympathetic to Black Hawk.<sup id="_ref-lewis3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lewis3" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-nrhp2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp2" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-whitecloud_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-whitecloud" title="">[6]</a></sup> Black Hawk&#39;s reason for crossing into <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a> was that he wanted to reclaim lost lands, and perhaps, create a confederacy of Native Americans to stand against white settlement.<sup id="_ref-lewis2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lewis2" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-whitecloud_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-whitecloud" title="">[6]</a></sup> Promises of aid from other Illinois tribes were made to the British Band and Black Hawk believed that promises of assistance were made by the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> in <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>.<sup id="_ref-whitecloud_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-whitecloud" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The group marched along the <a href="/wiki/Rock_River" id="w">Rock River</a> into Illinois under the leadership of Black Hawk. Illinois Governor <a href="/wiki/John_Reynolds_(U.S._politician)" id="w">John Reynolds</a> viewed the return of Black Hawk as an invasion and he immediately called up the <a href="/wiki/Militia" id="w">militia</a>.<sup id="_ref-lewis2A_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lewis2A" title="">[8]</a></sup> The military expedition was turned over to General <a href="/wiki/Henry_Atkinson" id="w">Henry Atkinson</a>, who Black Hawk addressed as &#34;White Beaver.&#34;<sup id="_ref-lewis4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lewis4" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hagan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hagan" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>Atkinson was not informed of Governor Reynolds&#39; decision to order Major <a href="/wiki/Isaiah_Stillman" id="w">Isaiah Stillman&#39;s</a> militia to march on Old Man&#39;s Creek, despite being in overall command. The orders themselves were vague. Stillman&#39;s orders were written under General <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Whiteside" id="w">Samuel Whiteside&#39;s</a> name and in Reynolds&#39; hand.<sup id="_ref-dyer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dyer" title="">[11]</a></sup> In fact, Whiteside had refused to accept Stillman&#39;s battalion under his command, thus leaving it &#34;orphaned&#34; and under the direct command of Reynolds.<sup id="_ref-miller_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-miller" title="">[12]</a></sup> The milita that was under the authority of Whiteside grew restless as they awaited the arrival of Atkinson and his Army regulars, many of the volunteer militia wanted to quit the war and head back home.<sup id="_ref-miller_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-miller" title="">[12]</a></sup> When diplomacy failed to bring Black Hawk back&#39;s band west, Stillman and Bailey&#39;s battalions of Illinois Militia was marched up the Rock River.<sup id="_ref-stmuseum_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stmuseum" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Prior to the battle at Stillman&#39;s Run, Black Hawk&#39;s grand vision of British support, and an <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native American</a> confederacy had collapsed.<sup id="_ref-nrhp2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhp2" title="">[5]</a></sup> There would be no one to aid him or his followers. The British Band started to weaken with hunger, and Black Hawk soon realized that the only option was to return back across the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a>. When he detected the U.S. militia camp eight miles (13 km) away, Black Hawk sent out peace envoys in order to negotiate a truce, they were told to wave a white flag at the militia.<sup id="_ref-wiscsr2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wiscsr2" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" id="w">Abraham Lincoln&#39;s</a> service during the Black Hawk War has been a source of discrepancies and questioning, with two major battle sites, including Stillman&#39;s Run, being affiliated with Lincoln in the aftermath of combat.

Lincoln made a humorous remark during an 1848 speech before the U.S. Congress in which he referenced his Black Hawk War service, mentioning Stillman&#39;s Run by name.</p>

<p>The marble facade on the Stillman Valley monument, erected in 1901, commemorating the battle, includes the reference to Lincoln&#39;s presence at Stillman&#39;s Run, &#34;The presence of soldier, statesman, martyr, Abraham Lincoln assisting in the burial of these honored dead has made this spot more sacred.&#34;<sup id="_ref-alo_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-alo" title="">[20]</a></sup>

Following the first confrontation at Stillman Valley, the exaggerated claim that 2,000 &#34;bloodthirsty warriors were sweeping all Northern Illinois with the bosom of destruction&#34; sent shock waves of terror through the region.<sup id="_ref-stmuseum_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stmuseum" title="">[13]</a></sup> Past midnight on <a href="/wiki/May_15" id="w">May 15</a> soldiers from Stillman&#39;s ill-fated detachment began streaming back into <a href="/wiki/Dixon%26%2339%3Bs_Ferry" id="w">Dixon&#39;s Ferry</a>, wide-eyed and panic-stricken, telling tales of a horrible slaughter that had ensued during the battle.
