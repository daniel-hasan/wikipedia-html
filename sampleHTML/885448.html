<p>A knee injury to his left <a href="/wiki/Medial_meniscus" id="w">medial meniscus</a> on April 7, 2004 required surgery and sidelined Mauer for over a month. After a rehabilitation stint with the Twins&#39; AAA affiliate <a href="/wiki/Rochester_Red_Wings" id="w">Rochester Red Wings</a>, Mauer returned to the Twins&#39; lineup in June. In July, pain and swelling in his knee forced an early end to Mauer&#39;s 2004 season. </p>
<p>Following his injury-shortened 2004, Mauer signed a contract worth $5.7 million with the Twins on January 24, 2005. In 2005, Mauer returned to the Twins&#39; lineup for his first full major league season and had 144 <a href="/wiki/Hit_(baseball)" id="w">hits</a> in 131 games, ending the year with an average of .294.

<p>After going 2-for-4 in the last game of the 2006 regular season, Mauer confessed to reporters, &#34;When I told you I wasn’t thinking about the batting title?  I was lying.  I’ve never been that nervous in my life.  I haven’t felt anything like that since Opening Day as a rookie.”</p>

<p>On February 11, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, Mauer agreed to a four-year, $33 million contract with the Twins to avoid arbitration.
