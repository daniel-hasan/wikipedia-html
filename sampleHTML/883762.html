Tom Deimer of <a href="/wiki/Cleveland%2C_Ohio" id="w">Cleveland&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer_(newspaper)" id="w">Plain Dealer</a></i> described him as a &#34;textbook Republican&#34; who is &#34;<a href="/wiki/Anti-abortion_movement" id="w">opposed to abortion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_States" id="w">gun control</a>, <a href="/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States" id="w">high taxes</a>, and costly government programs.&#34; In the House, he criticized government incompetence and charged corruption by the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic</a> majority that ran the House in the 1980s. McEwen, who had easily won three terms in the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Ohio House</a>, was elected to Congress at the age of thirty to replace a retiring representative in 1980 and easily won re-election five times.</p>
<p>After a bruising <a href="/wiki/Primary_election" id="w">primary</a> battle with another incumbent whose district was combined with his, in which McEwen faced charges of <a href="/wiki/House_banking_scandal" id="w">bouncing checks</a> on the House bank, he narrowly lost the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_election%2C_1992" id="w">1992 general election</a> to Democrat <a href="/wiki/Ted_Strickland" id="w">Ted Strickland</a>. Following an unsuccessful run in the adjacent <a href="/wiki/Ohio%26%2339%3Bs_2nd_congressional_district" id="w">Second District</a> in 1993, McEwen was largely absent from the Ohio political scene for a decade, until in 2005 he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Congress in the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_Second_Congressional_District_Election%2C_2005" id="w">Second District special election</a> to replace <a href="/wiki/Rob_Portman" id="w">Rob Portman</a>, who beat him in 1993, and finished second to the winner in the general election, <a href="/wiki/Jean_Schmidt" id="w">Jean Schmidt</a>. McEwen&#39;s 2005 platform was familiar from his past campaigns, advocating a <a href="/wiki/Pro-life" id="w">pro-life</a> stance, defending <a href="/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">Second Amendment</a> rights, and promising to limit taxes and government spending. In 2006, he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the Second District.</p>

<p>McEwen is married to the former Elizabeth &#34;Liz&#34; Boebinger and has four children: Meredith, Jonathan, Robert, and Elizabeth.

<p>After two years in his wife&#39;s family real estate business, serving as a vice president of Boebinger, Inc., he was elected at the age of twenty-four to the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Ohio House of Representatives</a> in 1974 from the 72nd House District representing southern Ohio. McEwen&#39;s district contained parts of Clinton, Fayette, Greene, and Highland Counties and all of Madison County. He was re-elected to two more two-year terms. In 1976, his plurality against Democrat L. James Matter was 14,816 votes, a number larger than the votes cast for Matter. (McEwen received 27,657 to Matter&#39;s 12,841.) McEwen was a supporter of the state <a href="/wiki/Lottery" id="w">lottery</a> in the House.<sup id="_ref-lottery_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lottery" title="">[3]</a></sup> Having previously directed Sixth District Congressman <a href="/wiki/Bill_Harsha" id="w">Bill Harsha</a>&#39;s re-election campaigns to Congress in 1976 and 1978, McEwen ran for Harsha&#39;s seat when he retired in 1980. Harsha was neutral in the eight-man primary that McEwen won but supported McEwen in the general election where he defeated <a href="/wiki/Psychologist" id="w">psychologist</a> and minister <a href="/wiki/Ted_Strickland" id="w">Ted Strickland</a>, Harsha&#39;s opponent in 1976 and 1978, who went on to become Governor of Ohio.</p>

<a id="Strong_words" name="Strong_words"></a><h2>Strong words</h2>
<p>McEwen was not a man to mince words.

<p /><blockquote>The total incompetence of the D.C. government in Washington, DC, has become an embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded do a better job of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in <a href="/wiki/Home_rule" id="w">home rule</a> that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.<sup id="_ref-incompetence_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-incompetence" title="">[14]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Late in his Congressional career, he began regular appearances on public affairs programs such as <i><a href="/wiki/Nightline" id="w">Nightline</a></i> and the <i><a href="/wiki/The_NewsHour_with_Jim_Lehrer" id="w">MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</a></i> and was often a guest on <a href="/wiki/C-SPAN" id="w">C-SPAN</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Cable_News_Network" id="w">Cable News Network</a>. Martin Gottlieb of the <i>Dayton Daily News</i>, a Democratic newspaper, thought McEwen&#39;s performances showed why he had remained in the background previously:</p>
<p /><blockquote>In the past, McEwen&#39;s ambition has taken the form of interest in higher office. Twice he made feints about seeking statewide office. But he didn&#39;t want to risk his congressional seat. Now he&#39;s found a way to nurse a healthy level of ambition without taking that risk. He has, of course, a pronounced tendency to be wrong about the issues&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. . Most typically, he appears as an ideological combatant. He seems to be selling himself to the nation&#39;s conservatives as an attractive spokesman. He&#39;s got enough talent to do it. In the days when McEwen was content to be a back-bencher, he was criticized on this page for his irrelevance on the important issues. Now, however, it is clear that the nation as a whole was better off when he was keeping his views to himself.<sup id="_ref-mcewensteps_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcewensteps" title="">[26]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>In his decade in Congress, McEwen compiled a conservative voting record, usually scoring in the single digits in the annual <a href="/wiki/Americans_for_Democratic_Action" id="w">Americans for Democratic Action</a> ratings and 85% or higher in the <a href="/wiki/American_Conservative_Union" id="w">American Conservative Union</a>&#39;s similar polls, though McEwen was never one of the most conservative Republicans in the House nor the most conservative Republican in the Ohio delegation.<sup id="_ref-voting_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-voting" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>McEwen often joined his fellow Republicans in making special order speeches in the House, which occur after the business for the day has concluded and are made to a nearly empty chamber.

<p>McEwen easily won re-election in every race save his last and was seen as unbeatable in his district. However, Ohio lost two seats in the 1990 <a href="/wiki/Reapportionment" id="w">reapportionment</a>. The Democrats and Republicans in the Ohio General Assembly struck a deal to eliminate one Democratic and one Republican district, as one congressman from each party was expected to retire. The Republican expected to retire was <a href="/wiki/Clarence_E._Miller" id="w">Clarence E.

The Democrats in the Statehouse would not reconsider the deal and Miller&#39;s Tenth District was obliterated.<sup id="_ref-barone_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-barone" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>The new district map was not agreed upon by the General Assembly until <a href="/wiki/March_26" id="w">March 26</a> <a href="/wiki/1992" id="w">1992</a>, one week before the filing deadline for the primary originally scheduled for <a href="/wiki/May_5" id="w">May 5</a>.

Miller&#39;s decision was also impacted by his strong personal distaste for McEwen.</p>
<p>After being hurt in a fall in his bathtub after slipping on a bar of soap, Miller was expected to withdraw and the Republican leadership hoped for a deal as late as <a href="/wiki/May_15" id="w">May 15</a>, the day Miller was to hold a press conference Ohio political observers thought he would use to announce his withdrawal.

Then when the full totals were released by <a href="/wiki/U.S._House_Committee_on_Standards_of_Official_Conduct" id="w">Ethics Committee</a> investigators, the number was revealed to have been 166 over thirty-nine months. McEwen said that he always had funds available to cover the alleged overdrafts, pointing to the policy of the House sergeant at arms, who ran the House bank, paying checks on an overdrawn account if it would not exceed the sum of the Representative&#39;s next paycheck.<sup id="_ref-kaplan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kaplan" title="">[31]</a></sup> In 1991, McEwen had also been criticized for his use of the <a href="/wiki/Franking_privilege" id="w">franking privilege</a> and his frequent trips overseas at taxpayer expense, but McEwen defended the trips as part of his work on the Intelligence Committee and in building relationships with legislatures overseas.<sup id="_ref-ruess_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ruess" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Miller_and_McEwen_spar" name="Miller_and_McEwen_spar"></a><h2>Miller and McEwen spar</h2>
<p>The primary race was bitter. Miller called McEwen &#34;<a href="/wiki/Pinocchio" id="w">Pinocchio</a>,&#34; and McEwen said of Miller, &#34;His misrepresentations and falsehoods are gargantuan. I tried to be his best friend in the delegation. I am deeply disappointed at the meanness of his effort.&#34; Tom Deimer of Cleveland&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer_(newspaper)" id="w">Plain Dealer</a></i> wrote that the two candidates were largely identical on the issues: &#34;both are textbook Republican conservatives, opposed to abortion, gun control, high taxes, and costly government programs — unless located in their districts.&#34; Miller noted he had no overdrafts at the House bank, saying, &#34;the score is 166 to nothing.&#34; McEwen said &#34;every one of my checks was free and clear. Every month&#39;s statement had a balance.&#34; McEwen ran commercials against Miller claiming the long-time congressman &#34;has fallen out of touch with Ohio&#34; and &#34;doesn&#39;t live in our district and isn&#39;t even registered to vote here.&#34; Miller struck back in a live-television interview by taking a <a href="/wiki/Wheat_Thins" id="w">Wheat Thin</a>, claiming it to be McEwen, and then taking a bite out of it.<sup id="_ref-deimer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-deimer" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

<p>The 1992 primary was so close it forced a recount and prompted a lawsuit.

In the end, McEwen&#39;s geographic advantage (he retained 59% of his old territory) put him over the top. Ominously, however, Miller trounced him in the five counties that had been in Miller&#39;s old district.</p>
<p>After the final result, Miller refused to endorse McEwen, though McEwen tried to sooth feelings by introducing H.R. 5727 in the House to name the dam and locks on the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_River" id="w">Ohio River</a> near <a href="/wiki/Gallipolis%2C_Ohio" id="w">Gallipolis</a> after Miller.<sup id="_ref-dam_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dam" title="">[36]</a></sup> Miller carried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the redistricting to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court" id="w">United States Supreme Court</a>, insisting district lines should be drawn on a politically neutral basis.</p>

<p>The old Sixth District was centered in southwestern and south-central Ohio around McEwen&#39;s hometown, Hillsboro. After redistricting, McEwen found himself running in a huge area stretching from <a href="/wiki/Lebanon%2C_Ohio" id="w">Lebanon</a> to <a href="/wiki/Marietta%2C_Ohio" id="w">Marietta</a>. This new district was very difficult to campaign in. It spilled across six media markets, meaning that McEwen had to buy ads in cities where most of the viewers couldn&#39;t vote in the district. It also lacked any large cities and possessed few unifying elements. His Democratic opponent was psychologist <a href="/wiki/Ted_Strickland" id="w">Ted Strickland</a>, whom he had defeated in his initial run in 1980.</p>

<p>McEwen faced questions about the bounced checks he had written on the House bank.

Martin Gottlieb wrote, &#34;McEwen says now that his problem was a form of excessive pride. He says he used to &#39;demand perfection&#39; of himself.&#34; McEwen also said, &#34;I felt I could never admit a mistake.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. I am very, very sorry.

<p>McEwen won four of the five counties in the district — Adams, Brown, Clermont and Warren. In Adams, once part of his district, he received 77% of the vote, sixty-seven points ahead of Portman.

DeWine also tried to depict McEwen as a <a href="/wiki/Carpetbagger" id="w">carpetbagger</a>, asking in television advertisements &#34;If Bob McEwen really cares about us, why has he spent the last twelve years living in <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a>?&#34; McEwen denied he had bounced any checks, repeating what he had claimed in 1992 and insisted that he had continued to reside in Ohio since he lost his re-election bid, noting he had never voted in Virginia nor held a Virginia drivers license.<sup id="_ref-dojletter_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dojletter" title="">[61]</a></sup> (McEwen did not live in the second district until <a href="/wiki/April_11" id="w">April 11</a>, when he bought a condominium in <a href="/wiki/Anderson_Township%2C_Hamilton_County%2C_Ohio" id="w">Anderson Township</a>; but DeWine did not live in the district until he bought a home there on <a href="/wiki/April_6" id="w">April 6</a>.<sup id="_ref-auditor_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-auditor" title="">[62]</a></sup>) DeWine quoted correspondence from the <a href="/wiki/Highland_County%2C_Ohio" id="w">Highland County</a> Board of Elections claiming the Board had cancelled McEwen&#39;s voter registration for living in Virginia.</p>
<p>DeWine also questioned McEwen&#39;s record on taxes, sending out mailings criticizing McEwen&#39;s vote on <a href="/wiki/May_24" id="w">May 24</a> <a href="/wiki/1982" id="w">1982</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Ninety-seventh_United_States_Congress" id="w">97th Congress</a> &#34;in support of a Democrat budget that raised out taxes by $233 billion.&#34; Two mailings focused on this issue, one featuring a photograph of Ronald Reagan that was captioned &#34;When President Reagan Needed Votes to Keep Taxes Low, Bob McEwen Said &#39;NO&#39;&#34;, the other asking &#34;Are We Still the Party of Lower Taxes?&#34;</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Jean_Schmidt" id="w">Jean Schmidt</a>, a former member of the Ohio House, benefited from the conservative vote being split by McEwen and <a href="/wiki/Tom_Brinkman" id="w">Tom Brinkman</a>. The official returns showed Schmidt had won with 14,331 votes (31%). McEwen finished second with 11,663 (25%), Brinkman was third with 9,320 (20%), and DeWine, who spent $1 million on his campaign, finished a distant fourth with 5,467 (12%). The remaining vote was split by the seven others, none of whom received more than 5%. Following the primary, McEwen campaigned with Schmidt in the general election against the Democratic nominee, attorney <a href="/wiki/Paul_Hackett" id="w">Paul Hackett</a>.</p>
