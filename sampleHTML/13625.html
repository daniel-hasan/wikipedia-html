<p><b>Holden</b>, officially <b>GM Holden Ltd</b>, is an <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australian</a> <a href="/wiki/Automaker" id="w">automaker</a> based in <a href="/wiki/Port_Melbourne%2C_Victoria" id="w">Port Melbourne, Victoria</a>. The company was originally independent but since 1931 has been a subsidiary of <a href="/wiki/General_Motors" id="w">General Motors</a> (GM).<sup id="_ref-profile_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-profile" title="">[1]</a></sup> Holden has taken charge of vehicle operations for General Motors in <a href="/wiki/Australasia" id="w">Australasia</a> and, on behalf of GM, holds partial ownership of <a href="/wiki/GM_Daewoo" id="w">GM Daewoo</a> in <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" id="w">South Korea</a>. Over the years, Holden has offered a broad range of locally produced vehicles, supplemented by various imported GM models. In the past, Holden has offered <a href="/wiki/Badge_engineering" id="w">rebadged</a> <a href="/wiki/Nissan" id="w">Nissan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Toyota" id="w">Toyota</a> models in sharing arrangements.</p>
<p>Holden <a href="/wiki/Bodywork" id="w">car bodies</a> are manufactured at <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth%2C_South_Australia" id="w">Elizabeth, South Australia</a>, and engines are produced at <a href="/wiki/Port_Melbourne%2C_Victoria" id="w">Port Melbourne, Victoria</a> (Fishermens Bend).<sup id="_ref-profile_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-profile" title="">[1]</a></sup> Historically, production or assembly plants were operated in all mainland <a href="/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia" id="w">states of Australia</a>: <a href="/wiki/Acacia_Ridge%2C_Queensland" id="w">Acacia Ridge, Queensland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dandenong%2C_Victoria" id="w">Dandenong, Victoria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mosman_Park%2C_Western_Australia" id="w">Mosman Park, Western Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pagewood%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Pagewood, New South Wales</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Woodville%2C_South_Australia" id="w">Woodville, South Australia</a> (body production only). Until 1990, <a href="/wiki/Holden_New_Zealand" id="w">Holden New Zealand</a> also operated a plant based in <a href="/wiki/Petone" id="w">Petone</a>. The consolidation of car production at Elizabeth, South Australia, was completed in 1988, but some assembly operations continued at Dandenong until the mid-1990s.<sup id="_ref-milestones_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-milestones" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Holden&#39;s involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia has led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability; in 2006, exports alone accounted for almost <a href="/wiki/AU%24" id="w">AU$1</a>.3&#160;billion in earnings.</p>

<p>In 1852, James Alexander Holden emigrated to <a href="/wiki/South_Australia" id="w">South Australia</a> from <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> and established <b>J.A. Holden &#38; Co</b>, a saddlery business in <a href="/wiki/Adelaide" id="w">Adelaide</a>, in 1856.<sup id="_ref-heritage1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage1" title="">[3]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Edward_Holden" id="w">Edward Holden</a>, James&#39; son, joined the firm in 1905 with an interest in automobiles.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships and, in 1908, Holden and Frost moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery.<sup id="_ref-Holden History_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Holden History" title="">[5]</a></sup> The company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in 1913, and Edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages.<sup id="_ref-milestones_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-milestones" title="">[2]</a></sup> After 1917, wartime trade restrictions led the company to commence full-scale production of vehicle body shells. J.A. Holden incorporated a new company in 1919, <b>Holden&#39;s Motor Body Builders Ltd</b> (HMBB) specialising in car bodies. By 1923, HMBB were producing 12,000 units per year.<sup id="_ref-Holden History_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Holden History" title="">[5]</a></sup> From 1924, HMBB became the exclusive supplier of <a href="/wiki/Bodywork" id="w">car bodies</a> for GM in Australia, with manufacturing taking place at the new <a href="/wiki/Woodville%2C_South_Australia" id="w">Woodville, South Australia</a> plant.<sup id="_ref-The Holden car in Australia_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Holden car in Australia" title="">[6]</a></sup> These bodies were made to suit a number of <a href="/wiki/Chassis" id="w">chassis</a> imported from manufacturers such as <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet" id="w">Chevrolet</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dodge" id="w">Dodge</a>.<sup id="_ref-Holden History_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Holden History" title="">[5]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">Great Depression</a> era led to a substantial downturn in production, from 34,000 units annually in 1930 to just 1,651 units one year later.<sup id="_ref-Holden History_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Holden History" title="">[5]</a></sup> In 1931, General Motors purchased the business and formed <b>General Motorsâ€“Holden&#39;s Ltd</b>.<sup id="_ref-heritage1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage1" title="">[3]</a></sup> Since then, two name changes have occurred: the first, in 1998, changed the name to <b>Holden Ltd</b>, and the second, in May 2005, to <b>GM Holden Ltd</b>.<sup id="_ref-heritage1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage1" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>

<p>Holden&#39;s first full-scale factory in <a href="/wiki/Port_Melbourne%2C_Victoria" id="w">Fishermens Bend</a> was completed in 1936, with construction beginning in 1939 on a new plant in <a href="/wiki/Pagewood%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Pagewood, New South Wales</a>.<sup id="_ref-milestones_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-milestones" title="">[2]</a></sup> However, <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> delayed car production until April 1948 when the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Australia" id="w">Australian Government</a> took steps to encourage an Australian automotive industry.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> During the war years, production shifted to manufacture vehicle bodies, <a href="/wiki/Field_gun" id="w">field guns</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aircraft" id="w">aircraft</a>, aeroplane and marine engines.<sup id="_ref-The Holden car in Australia_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Holden car in Australia" title="">[6]</a></sup> Both <a href="/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company" id="w">Ford</a> and General Motors provided studies to the Australian Government to produce &#34;Australia&#39;s Own Car&#34;.

<p>Holden&#39;s managing director, <a href="/wiki/Laurence_Hartnett" id="w">Laurence Hartnett</a>, was particularly enthusiastic about developing and building an Australian car. The <a href="/wiki/Holden_48-215" id="w">48-215</a>, also unofficially called the FX, was launched in 1948 fitted with a 132.5&#160;<a href="/wiki/Cubic_inch" id="w">cubic inch</a> (2,171&#160;cc) engine.<sup id="_ref-heritage1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage1" title="">[3]</a></sup> The design however, was based on a previously rejected post-war <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet" id="w">Chevrolet</a> proposal.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="1950s" name="1950s"></a><h2> 1950s </h2>
<p>During the 1950s, Holden dominated the Australian market by offering buyers a combination of style, comfort, performance, economy, and value that no competitor could match. Less expensive four-cylinder cars did not offer Holden&#39;s ability to deal with rugged rural areas.<sup id="_ref-NAA_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NAA" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-heritage1_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage1" title="">[3]</a></sup> Another factor in Holden&#39;s success was its large investment in production capacity, which allowed the company to meet increased post-war demand for motor cars.<sup id="_ref-milestones_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-milestones" title="">[2]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Holden_48-215" id="w">48-215</a> sedans were produced in parallel with the <a href="/wiki/Holden_50-2106" id="w">50-2106</a> <a href="/wiki/Coupe_utility" id="w">coupe utility</a> from 1951; the latter was known <a href="/wiki/Colloquialism" id="w">colloquially</a> as the &#34;Ute&#34; and became ubiquitous in Australian <a href="/wiki/Rural" id="w">rural</a> areas as the workhorse of choice. Production continued with minor changes until 1953, when the Ute was replaced by the facelifted <a href="/wiki/Holden_FJ" id="w">FJ</a> model.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The FJ was the first major change to the Holden since its 1948 introduction. Over time it gained iconic status and remains one of Australia&#39;s most recognisable automotive symbols.<sup id="_ref-heritage1_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage1" title="">[3]</a></sup> A new horizontally slatted radiator grille dominated the front-end of the FJ, which had other trim changes, along with a large rear window, but no changes were made to the body panels.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Although the FJ was little changed from the 48-215, marketing campaigns and price cuts kept vehicle sales steady until a completely redesigned model, the FE, was launched in 1956, and offered as both a <a href="/wiki/Station_wagon" id="w">station wagon</a> and a sedan. Mechanical components carried over from the FJ, but the appearance was very different. Strong sales continued in Australia, and Holden achieved a market share of more than 50 percent. The opening of a new plant in <a href="/wiki/Dandenong%2C_Victoria" id="w">Dandenong, Victoria</a> in 1956 brought with it further jobs, with Holden employing 19,000 workers country-wide by 1959.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Holden paid homage to the FJ with the <a href="/wiki/Holden_Efijy" id="w">Efijy</a> <a href="/wiki/Concept_car" id="w">concept car</a> at the 2005 <a href="/wiki/Australian_International_Motor_Show" id="w">Australian International Motor Show</a> in <a href="/wiki/Sydney" id="w">Sydney</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<a id="1960s" name="1960s"></a><h2> 1960s </h2>
<p>In the 1960s, Holden faced serious competition for the first time; its major competitors began to import cars. In 1960, Holden began to offer its third major new model, the FB. The FB&#39;s style was inspired by that of 1950s Chevrolets, with <a href="/wiki/Tailfin" id="w">tailfins</a> and a wrap-around <a href="/wiki/Windshield" id="w">windshield</a> with &#34;dog leg&#34; <a href="/wiki/Pillar_(car)" id="w">A-pillars</a>. By the time Holden introduced the model, many considered the appearance dated.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Much of the motoring industry at the time noted that the adopted style did not translate well to the more compact Holden. The FB became the first Holden that was adapted for <a href="/wiki/Driving_on_the_left_or_right" id="w">left-hand-drive</a> markets, enhancing its export potential.<sup id="_ref-heritage1_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1960, soon after Holden introduced the FB, <a href="/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company" id="w">Ford</a> unveiled the new <a href="/wiki/Ford_Falcon_(Australia)" id="w">Falcon</a> in Australia, only months after its introduction in the United States. To Holden&#39;s advantage, the Falcon was not durable, particularly in the front suspension. Early tests indicated that the Falcon was ill-suited for <a href="/wiki/Environment_of_Australia" id="w">Australian conditions</a>, and Falcon customers later agreed.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> In response to the Falcon, Holden introduced the facelifted EK in 1961; the new model featured two-tone paintwork, chrome trim, and optional <a href="/wiki/Automatic_transmission" id="w">automatic transmission</a>.<sup id="_ref-heritage1_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage1" title="">[3]</a></sup> The EH, premiering in 1963, featured the new <a href="/wiki/Holden_Red_motor" id="w">Red motor</a>, which provided better vehicle performance than the previous <a href="/wiki/Holden_Grey_motor" id="w">Grey motor</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> In February 1965 Holden introduced the HD,<sup id="_ref-heritage1_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage1" title="">[3]</a></sup> quickly replaced by the facelifted HR in April 1966 because the car&#39;s styling proved unpopular. The HR had new front and rear styling and higher-capacity engines, and Holden sold more than 250,000 units in the two-year production run. More significantly, the HR Holden now had <a href="/wiki/Seat_belt" id="w">seat belts</a> as standard; Holden thus became the first Australian automaker to provide the safety device as standard equipment across all models.<sup id="_ref-heritage2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage2" title="">[17]</a></sup> 1966 also marked the completion of the production plant in <a href="/wiki/Acacia_Ridge%2C_Queensland" id="w">Acacia Ridge, Queensland</a>.<sup id="_ref-milestones_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-milestones" title="">[2]</a></sup>   </p>

Exterior changes included a new radiator grille,<sup id="_ref-HT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HT" title="">[21]</a></sup> new rear doors on sedans (with larger windows), and new rear styling with a larger rear window. Holden also introduced the first Australian-designed and mass-produced V8 engine, available in two capacities: 253&#160;cubic inch (4.2&#160;L) and 308&#160;cubic inch (5.0&#160;L).<sup id="_ref-HT_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HT" title="">[21]</a></sup> The following year, Holden offered the HG, a lightly facelifted car with a revised radiator grille, tail lights, interior trim, and colours. The HG&#39;s big selling point was its Tri-Matic three-speed automatic transmission, which Holden produced at its <a href="/wiki/Woodville%2C_South_Australia" id="w">Woodville, South Australia</a>, factory.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1964, Holden began assembling the HA series <a href="/wiki/Vauxhall_Viva" id="w">Vauxhall Viva</a>, marketing it as &#34;Vivaâ€”the GMH small car&#34; to de-emphasise the <a href="/wiki/Vauxhall_Motors" id="w">Vauxhall</a> brand. The first <a href="/wiki/Holden_Torana" id="w">Holden Torana</a>, the HB, replaced the Viva in 1967. Holden offered the LC, a Torana with new styling, in 1969; this was the first compact six-cylinder car in the Australian marketplace,<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> and Holden&#39;s first <a href="/wiki/Compact_car" id="w">compact car</a> in a market dominated by <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> models.

<p>In 1971, Holden launched its new HQ series, often considered the most important new model since the original Holden.<sup id="_ref-heritage2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage2" title="">[17]</a></sup> At this time, the company was producing all of its passenger cars in Australia, and every model was of Australian design; however, by the end of the decade, Holden was producing cars based on overseas designs. The HQ was thoroughly re-engineered, featuring a perimeter frame and semi-<a href="/wiki/Monocoque" id="w">monocoque</a> (unibody) construction. This provided a level of refinement not seen in this class of vehicle before. Other firsts included a wide, 60&#160;inch (1,500&#160;mm) track, all-coil suspension, an extended wheelbase for station wagons, utilities and <a href="/wiki/Panel_van" id="w">panel vans</a>. The series included a new prestige brand, <a href="/wiki/Statesman_(automobile)" id="w">Statesman</a>, which also had a longer wheelbase.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> The HQ framework led to a new generation of two-door <a href="/wiki/Holden_Monaro" id="w">Monaros</a>,<sup id="_ref-heritage2_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage2" title="">[17]</a></sup> and, despite the introduction of the similar sized competitors, the HQ became the top-selling Holden of all time,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> with 485,650 units sold in three years.<sup id="_ref-heritage2_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage2" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>The next development of the Torana was the LH series, introduced in 1974.<sup id="_ref-LH_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LH" title="">[27]</a></sup> The LH was offered only as a four-door sedan; a three-door hatchback variant was added in the superseding LX series (manufactured between 1976 and 1978). Engines for the LH and LX series included 1.9&#160;litre four-cylinder, 2.8&#160;litre and 3.3&#160;litre six-cylinder, and 4.2&#160;litre and 5.0&#160;litre eight-cylinder.<sup id="_ref-LH_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LH" title="">[27]</a></sup> At the time, the Torana was the only car in the world to be offered with such a diverse range of engines.

<p>Holden&#39;s most popular car to date, the <a href="/wiki/Holden_Commodore" id="w">Commodore</a>, was introduced in 1978 as the <a href="/wiki/Holden_VB_Commodore" id="w">VB</a>.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> The new family car was loosely based on the <a href="/wiki/Opel_Rekord" id="w">Opel Rekord</a> E body shell, but with the front from the <a href="/wiki/Opel_Senator" id="w">Opel Senator</a> grafted to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and V8 engines. Initially, the Commodore maintained Holden&#39;s sales leadership in Australia.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> However, some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered the car&#39;s acceptance. In particular, it was narrower than its predecessor and its Falcon rival,  making it less comfortable for three rear-seat passengers.

<p>Holden discontinued the Torana in 1979 and the Sunbird in 1980.

<a id="1980s" name="1980s"></a><h2> 1980s </h2>
<p>The 1980s were challenging for Holden and for the Australian car industry. The Australian Government tried to revive the industry with the <a href="/wiki/Button_car_plan" id="w">Button car plan</a>, which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher, more economical volumes, and to export cars.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> In 1980, Holden shut-down its <a href="/wiki/Pagewood%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Pagewood, New South Wales</a> production plant and introduced the light commercial Rodeo, sourced from Isuzu in Japan.<sup id="_ref-milestones_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-milestones" title="">[2]</a></sup> The Rodeo was available in both two- and four-wheel drive <a href="/wiki/Chassis_cab" id="w">chassis cab</a> models with a choice of <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" id="w">petrol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Diesel" id="w">diesel</a> powerplants.<sup id="_ref-heritage2_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage2" title="">[17]</a></sup> The range was updated in 1988 with the TF series, based on the <a href="/wiki/Isuzu_TF" id="w">Isuzu TF</a>.

<p>Holden faced financial challenges when sales of the <a href="/wiki/Holden_Commodore" id="w">Commodore</a> and <a href="/wiki/Isuzu_Gemini" id="w">Gemini</a> declined.

By 1997, the federal government had already cut tariffs to 22.5% from 57.5% ten years earlier, and by 2000 were planning to reduce this even further down to 15%.

<p>Since the 1960s, Holden models have been a staple of domestic <a href="/wiki/Touring_car_racing" id="w">touring car racing</a>, and the quasi-factory <a href="/wiki/Holden_Racing_Team" id="w">Holden Racing Team</a> (HRT) has successfully participated in <a href="/wiki/V8_Supercar" id="w">V8 Supercar</a> racing.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup> In 1987, <a href="/wiki/Holden_Special_Vehicles" id="w">Holden Special Vehicles</a> (HSV) was formed in partnership with Tom Walkinshaw, who primarily manufactures modified, high-performance Commodore variants.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup> To further reinforce the brand, HSV introduced the <a href="/wiki/HSV_Dealer_Team" id="w">Toll HSV Dealer Team</a> into the V8 Supercar fold in 2005 under the naming rights of HSV Toll Racing.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup></p>
<p>The logo, or &#34;Holden lion and stone&#34; as it is known, has played a vital role in establishing Holden&#39;s identity. In 1928, Holden&#39;s Motor Body Builders appointed <a href="/wiki/Rayner_Hoff" id="w">Rayner Hoff</a> to design the emblem. The logo refers to a <a href="/wiki/Prehistory" id="w">prehistoric</a> fable, in which observations of <a href="/wiki/Lion" id="w">lions</a> rolling stones led to the invention of the wheel. With the 1948 launch of the <a href="/wiki/Holden_48-215" id="w">48-215</a>, Holden revised its logo and commissioned another redesign in 1972 to better represent the company.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup> The emblem was reworked once more in 1994.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup></p>

<p>Holden first began to export vehicles in 1954, sending the <a href="/wiki/Holden_FJ" id="w">FJ</a> to New Zealand. New Zealand is now Holden&#39;s largest export market, with the large <a href="/wiki/Holden_Commodore" id="w">Commodore</a> model toping the sales charts from-time-to-time. To combat declining large car sales in Australia due to rising <a href="/wiki/Gasoline_usage_and_pricing" id="w">fuel costs</a>, the reduction of import <a href="/wiki/Tariff" id="w">tariffs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Demographics" id="w">demographic</a> changes, Holden began to broaden their export potential by catering their full-size Commodore and <a href="/wiki/Holden_Statesman" id="w">Statesman</a> models to left-hand drive markets.
