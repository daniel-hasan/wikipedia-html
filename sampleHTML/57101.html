<b>Anne of Denmark</b> (<a href="/wiki/12_December" id="w">12 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1574" id="w">1574</a> – <a href="/wiki/2_March" id="w">2 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1619" id="w">1619</a>) was <a href="/wiki/Queen_consort" id="w">queen consort</a> of <a href="/wiki/James_I_of_England" id="w">James VI of Scots, I of England</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The second daughter of King <a href="/wiki/Frederick_II_of_Denmark" id="w">Frederick II of Denmark</a>, Anne married James in 1589 at the age of fourteen and bore him three children who survived infancy, including the future <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" id="w">Charles I of England</a>. She demonstrated an independent streak and a willingness to use factional Scottish politics in her conflicts with James over the custody of <a href="/wiki/Henry_Frederick%2C_Prince_of_Wales" id="w"> Prince Henry</a> and his treatment of her friend Beatrix Ruthven. Anne appears to have loved James at first, but the couple gradually drifted and eventually lived apart, though mutual respect and a degree of affection survived. </p>
<p>In England, Anne shifted her energies from factional politics to patronage of the arts and constructed a magnificent court of her own, hosting one of the richest cultural <a href="/wiki/Salon_(gathering)" id="w">salons</a> in Europe.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> After 1612, she suffered sustained bouts of ill health and gradually withdrew from the centre of court life. Though she was reported to have died a <a href="/wiki/Protestant" id="w">Protestant</a>, evidence suggests that she may have converted to <a href="/wiki/Catholicism" id="w">Catholicism</a> at some stage in her life.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Historians have traditionally dismissed Anne as a lightweight queen, frivolous and self-indulgent.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> However, recent reappraisals acknowledge Anne&#39;s assertive independence and, in particular, her dynamic significance as a patron of the arts during the famous <a href="/wiki/Jacobean_era" id="w">Jacobean age</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

Anne was born on <a href="/wiki/12_December" id="w">12 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1574" id="w">1574</a> at the castle of <a href="/wiki/Skanderborg" id="w">Skanderborg</a>, on the <a href="/wiki/Jutland_Peninsula" id="w">Jutland Peninsula</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Denmark%E2%80%93Norway" id="w"> Kingdom of Denmark</a>.

Compared with the roving Danish court, where King Frederick was notorious for gargantuan meals, heavy drinking, and restless behaviour which included unfaithfulness to the Queen, Güstrow provided Anne with a frugal and stable life during her early childhood.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Christian was also sent to be brought up at Güstrow; but two years later, in 1579, the <a href="/wiki/Rigsraadet" id="w"> Rigsraad</a>, or Danish Privy Council, successfully requested his removal to Denmark, and Anne and Elizabeth returned with him.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Anne enjoyed a close and happy family upbringing in Denmark, thanks largely to Queen Sophie, who tended the children herself during their illnesses.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Suitors from all over Europe sought the hands of Anne and her older sister in marriage, including <a href="/wiki/James_I_of_England" id="w"> James VI</a> of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>, who favoured Denmark as a kingdom reformed in religion and a profitable trading partner.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Scottish ambassadors had at first concentrated their suit on the oldest daughter,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> but Frederick betrothed Elizabeth to <a href="/wiki/Henry_Julius%2C_Duke_of_Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg" id="w"> Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick</a>, promising the Scots instead that &#34;for the second [daughter] Anna, if the King did like her, he should have her&#34;.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Relationship_with_James" name="Relationship_with_James"></a><h2>Relationship with James</h2>

<p>By all accounts, James was at first entranced by his bride, but his infatuation evaporated quickly and the couple often found themselves at loggerheads, though in the early years of their marriage, James seems always to have treated Anne with patience and affection.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> Between 1593 and 1595, James was romantically linked with Anne Murray, later Lady <a href="/wiki/Glamis" id="w">Glamis</a>, whom he addressed in verse as &#34;my mistress and my love&#34;; and Anne herself was also occasionally the subject of scandalous rumours.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> In <i><a href="/wiki/Basilikon_Doron" id="w">Basilikon Doron</a></i>, written in 1597–8, James described marriage as &#34;the greatest earthly felicitie or miserie, that can come to a man&#34;.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>From the first moment of the marriage, Anne was under pressure to provide James and Scotland with an heir,<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> but the passing of 1591 and 1592 with no sign of a pregnancy provoked renewed libels on the theme of James’s fondness for male company, and whispers against Anne &#34;for that she proves not with child&#34;.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> As a result, there was great public relief when on <a href="/wiki/19_February" id="w">19 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1594" id="w">1594</a> Anne gave birth to her first child, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Frederick%2C_Prince_of_Wales" id="w"> Henry Frederick</a>.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Prince Henry Stuart, c.1608, by Robert Peake the Elder.</div></p>
<p>It was quickly brought home to Anne that she was to have no say in the care of her son. James appointed as head of the nursery his former nurse Helen Little, who installed Henry in James&#39;s own old oak cradle.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> Most distressingly for Anne, James insisted on placing Prince Henry in the custody of <a href="/wiki/John_Erskine%2C_18th_Earl_of_Mar" id="w"> John Erskine, Earl of Mar</a>, at <a href="/wiki/Stirling_Castle" id="w">Stirling Castle</a>, in keeping with Scottish Royal tradition.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>In late 1594, Anne began a furious campaign for custody of Henry, recruiting a faction of supporters to her cause, including the chancellor, <a href="/wiki/John_Maitland%2C_1st_Lord_Maitland_of_Thirlestane" id="w"> John Maitland of Thirlestane</a>.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> Nervous of the lengths to which Anne might go, James formally charged Mar in writing never to surrender Henry to anyone except on orders from his own mouth, &#34;because in the surety of my son consists my surety&#34;, nor to yield Henry to the Queen even in the event of his own death.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> Anne demanded the matter be referred to the Council, but James would not hear of it.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> After public scenes in which James reduced her to rage and tears over the issue,<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> Anne became so bitterly upset that in July 1595 she suffered a miscarriage.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> Thereafter, she outwardly abandoned her campaign, but it was thought permanent damage had been done to the marriage.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> In August 1595, <a href="/wiki/John_Colville_(politician)" id="w">John Colville</a> wrote: &#34;There is nothing but lurking hatred disguised with cunning dissimulation betwixt the King and the Queen, each intending by slight to overcome the other.&#34;<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Anne saw a belated opportunity to gain custody of Henry in 1603 when James left for <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, taking the Earl of Mar with him, to assume the English throne following the death of <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England" id="w">Queen Elizabeth</a>.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> Pregnant at the time, Anne descended on Stirling with a force of &#34;well-supported&#34; nobles, intent on removing the nine-year-old Henry, whom she had hardly seen for five years; but Mar&#39;s mother and brother would allow her to bring no more than two attendants with her into the castle.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> The obduracy of Henry&#39;s keepers sent Anne into such a fury that she suffered another miscarriage: according to <a href="/wiki/David_Calderwood" id="w">David Calderwood</a>, she &#34;went to bed in anger and parted with child the tenth of May&#34;.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>When the Earl of Mar returned with James’s instructions that Anne join him in the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_England" id="w">Kingdom of England</a>, she informed James by letter that she refused to do so unless allowed custody of Henry.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> This &#34;forceful maternal action&#34;, as historian Pauline Croft describes it, obliged James to climb down at last, though he reproved Anne for &#34;<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Froward">froward</a> womanly apprehensions&#34; and described her behaviour in a letter to Mar as &#34;wilfulness&#34;.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> After a brief convalescence from the <a href="/wiki/Miscarriage" id="w">miscarriage</a>, Anne duly travelled south with Prince Henry,<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> their progress causing a sensation in England. <a href="/wiki/Lady_Anne_Clifford" id="w">Lady Anne Clifford</a> recorded that she and her mother killed three horses in their haste to see the Queen, and that when James met Anne near <a href="/wiki/Windsor_Castle" id="w"> Windsor</a>, &#34;there was such an infinite number of lords and ladies and so great a Court as I think I shall never see the like again&#34;.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>

<p>A briefer confrontation occurred in 1613 when Anne shot James&#39;s favourite dog dead during a hunting session; after his initial rage, James smoothed things over with the gift of a £2000 diamond in memory of the dog, whose name was Jewel.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> In 1603, James fought with Anne over the proposed composition of her English household, sending her a message that &#34;his Majesty took her continued perversity very heinously&#34;.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> In turn, Anne took exception to James&#39;s drinking: in 1604 she confided to the French envoy, &#34;the King drinks so much, and conducts himself so ill in every respect, that I expect an early and evil result&#34;.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup></p>

<p>In London, Anne adopted a cosmopolitan lifestyle, while James preferred to escape the capital, most often at his hunting lodge in <a href="/wiki/Royston%2C_Hertfordshire" id="w"> Royston</a>.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> Anne&#39;s chaplain, <a href="/wiki/Godfrey_Goodman" id="w">Godfrey Goodman</a>, later summed up the royal relationship: &#34;The King himself was a very chaste man, and there was little in the Queen to make him <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Uxorious">uxorious</a>; yet they did love as well as man and wife could do, not conversing together&#34;.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> Anne moved into <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Palace" id="w">Greenwich Palace</a> and then <a href="/wiki/Somerset_House" id="w">Somerset House</a>, which she renamed Denmark House. After 1607, she and James rarely lived together,<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> by which time she had borne seven children and suffered at least three miscarriages. After narrowly surviving the birth and death of her last baby, Sophia, in 1607, Anne’s decision to have no more children may have widened the gulf between her and James.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The death of Prince Henry in 1612 at the age of eighteen, probably from typhoid, and the departure for <a href="/wiki/Heidelberg" id="w">Heidelberg</a> of the sixteen-year-old <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Bohemia" id="w"> Princess Elizabeth</a> in April 1613, after marrying <a href="/wiki/Frederick_V%2C_Elector_Palatine" id="w"> Elector Frederick V of the Palatine</a>,<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> further weakened the family ties binding Anne and James.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> Henry&#39;s death hit Anne particularly hard; the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Venice" id="w">Venetian</a> ambassador was advised not to offer condolences to her &#34;because she cannot bear to have it mentioned; nor does she ever recall it without abundant tears and sighs&#34;.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup> From this time forward, Anne’s health deteriorated, and she withdrew from the centre of cultural and political activities, staging her last known <a href="/wiki/Masque" id="w">masque</a> in 1614 and no longer maintaining a noble court.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup> Her influence over James visibly waned as he became openly dependent on powerful favourites.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Reaction_to_favourites" name="Reaction_to_favourites"></a><h3>Reaction to favourites</h3>

<p>Although James had always adopted male <a href="/wiki/Favourite" id="w">favourites</a> among his courtiers, he now encouraged them to play a role in the government. Anne reacted very differently to the two powerful favourites who dominated the second half of her husband&#39;s English reign, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Carr%2C_1st_Earl_of_Somerset" id="w">Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset</a>, and <a href="/wiki/George_Villiers%2C_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham" id="w">George Villiers</a>, the future Duke of Buckingham. She detested Carr,<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup> but she encouraged the rise of Villiers, whom James knighted in her bedchamber;<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup> and she developed friendly relations with him, calling him her &#34;dog&#34;.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> Even so, Anne found herself increasingly ignored after Buckingham&#39;s rise and became a lonely figure towards the end of her life.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2>Religion</h2>

<p>A further source of difference between Anne and James was the issue of religion; for example, she abstained from the <a href="/wiki/Anglican" id="w">Anglican</a> <a href="/wiki/Eucharist" id="w"> communion</a> at her coronation.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup> Anne had been brought up a <a href="/wiki/Lutheran" id="w">Lutheran</a>, but she may have discreetly converted to <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w"> Catholicism</a> at some point, a politically embarrassing scenario which alarmed ministers of the Scottish <a href="/wiki/Kirk" id="w"> Kirk</a> and caused suspicion in Anglican England.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup></p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth had certainly been worried about the possibility and sent messages to Anne warning her not to listen to <a href="/wiki/Papist" id="w">papist</a> counsellors and requesting the names of anyone who had tried to convert her; Anne had replied that there was no need to name names because any such efforts had failed.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup> Anne drew criticism from the Kirk for keeping Henrietta Gordon, wife of the exiled Catholic <a href="/wiki/George_Gordon%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Huntly" id="w"> George Gordon, Marquess of Huntly</a>, as a confidante;<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup> after Huntly&#39;s return in 1596, the <a href="/wiki/St_Andrews" id="w">St Andrews</a> minister David Black called Anne an <a href="/wiki/Atheist" id="w">atheist</a> and remarked in a sermon that &#34;the Queen of Scotland was a woman for whom, for fashion&#39;s sake, the clergy might pray but from whom no good could be hoped&#34;.<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>
<p>When former intelligencer Sir Anthony Standen was discovered bringing Anne a rosary from <a href="/wiki/Pope_Clement_VIII" id="w">Pope Clement VIII</a> in 1603, James imprisoned him in the Tower for ten months.<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup> Anne protested her annoyance at the gift, but eventually secured Standen&#39;s release.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup></p>
<p>Like James, Anne later supported a Catholic match for both their sons, and her correspondence with the potential bride, <a href="/wiki/Maria_Anna_of_Spain" id="w"> the Spanish Infanta, Maria Anna</a>, included a request that two <a href="/wiki/Friar" id="w">friars</a> be sent to <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" id="w">Jerusalem</a> to pray for her and the King.<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup> The papacy itself was never quite sure where Anne stood; in 1612, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Paul_V" id="w">Pope Paul V</a> advised a nuncio: &#34;Not considering the inconstancy of that Queen and the many changes she had made in religious matters and that even if it might be true that she might be a Catholic, one should not take on oneself any judgement&#34;.<sup id="_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#_note-96" title="">[96]</a></sup></p>

<p>In Scotland, Anne sometimes exploited Court factionalism for her own ends, in particular by supporting the enemies of the Earl of Mar.<sup id="_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#_note-97" title="">[97]</a></sup> As a result, James did not trust her with secrets of state. <a href="/wiki/Henry_Howard%2C_1st_Earl_of_Northampton" id="w"> Henry Howard</a>, active in the highly secret diplomacy concerning the English succession, subtly reminded James that though Anne possessed every virtue, <a href="/wiki/Eve_(Bible)#Eve in Christianity" id="w"> Eve</a> was corrupted by the <a href="/wiki/Serpent_(symbolism)#Judeo-Christian references" id="w"> serpent</a>.<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup> In practice, Anne was little interested in high politics unless they touched on the fate of her children or friends.<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup></p>
<p>In England, Anne largely turned from political to social and artistic activities.<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup> Though she participated fully in the life of James’s Court and maintained a Court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting herself with discretion and graciousness in public. Anne played a crucial role, for example, in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors the prestige of the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Stuart" id="w"> Stuart dynasty</a> and its <a href="/wiki/House_of_Oldenburg" id="w"> Danish connections</a>.<sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[101]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Reputation" name="Reputation"></a><h3>Reputation</h3>

<p>Anne has traditionally been regarded with condescension by historians, who have emphasized her triviality and extravagance.<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup> Along with James, she tended to be dismissed by a historical tradition, beginning with the anti-Stuart historians of the mid-<a href="/wiki/17th_century" id="w">17th century</a>, which saw in the self-indulgence and vanity of the Jacobean court the origins of the <a href="/wiki/English_civil_war" id="w">English civil war</a>. Historian David Harris Willson, in his 1956 biography of James, delivered this damning verdict: &#34;Anne had little influence over her husband. She could not share his intellectual interests, and she confirmed the foolish contempt with which he regarded women. Alas! The king had married a stupid wife.&#34;<sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[103]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/19th_century" id="w">19th century</a> biographer <a href="/wiki/Agnes_Strickland" id="w">Agnes Strickland</a> condemned Anne&#39;s actions to regain custody of Prince Henry as irresponsible: &#34;It must lower the character of Anne of Denmark in the eyes of everyone, both as a woman and queen, that she...preferred to indulge the mere instincts of maternity at the risk of involving her husband, her infant, and their kingdom, in the strife and misery of unnatural warfare.&#34;<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[104]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, the reassessment of James in the past two decades, as an able ruler who extended royal power in Scotland and preserved his kingdoms from war throughout his reign,<sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup> has been accompanied by a re-evaluation of Anne as an influential political figure and assertive mother, at least for as long as the royal marriage remained a reality.<sup id="_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#_note-106" title="">[106]</a></sup> John Leeds Barroll argues in his cultural biography of Anne that her political interventions in Scotland were more significant, and certainly more troublesome, than previously noticed; and Clare McManus, among other cultural historians, has highlighted Anne&#39;s influential role in the Jacobean cultural flowering, not only as a patron of writers and artists but as a performer herself.<sup id="_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#_note-107" title="">[107]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a homage to his mother, Charles I had Cape Ann in Massachusetts named after her.</p>
<a id="Patron_of_the_arts" name="Patron_of_the_arts"></a><h2>Patron of the arts</h2>

<p>Anne shared with James the fault of extravagance, though it took her several years to exhaust her considerable dowry.<sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[108]</a></sup> She loved dancing and pageants, activities often frowned upon in <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian" id="w">Presbyterian</a> Scotland, but for which she found a vibrant outlet in <a href="/wiki/Jacobean_era" id="w">Jacobean</a> London, where she created a &#34;rich and hospitable&#34; cultural climate at the Royal Court,<sup id="_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#_note-109" title="">[109]</a></sup> became an enthusiastic playgoer, and sponsored lavish <a href="/wiki/Masque" id="w">masques</a>. Sir Walter Cope, asked by Robert Cecil to select a play for the Queen during her brother Duke Ulric of <a href="/wiki/Holstein" id="w">Holstein</a>&#39;s visit, wrote, &#34;Burbage is come and says there is no new play the Queen has not seen but they have revived an old one called <i><a href="/wiki/Love%26%2339%3Bs_Labour%26%2339%3Bs_Lost" id="w">Love&#39;s Labour&#39;s Lost</a></i> which for wit and mirth he says will please her exceedingly&#34;.<sup id="_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#_note-110" title="">[110]</a></sup> Anne’s masques, scaling unprecedented heights of dramatic staging and spectacle,<sup id="_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#_note-111" title="">[111]</a></sup> were avidly attended by foreign ambassadors and dignitaries and functioned as a potent demonstration of the English crown’s European significance. Zorzi Giustinian, the Venetian ambassador, wrote of the Christmas 1604 masque that &#34;in everyone&#39;s opinion no other Court could have displayed such pomp and riches&#34;.<sup id="_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#_note-112" title="">[112]</a></sup></p>

<p>Anne&#39;s masques were responsible for almost all the courtly female performance in the first two decades of the seventeenth century and are regarded as crucial to the history of women&#39;s performance.<sup id="_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#_note-113" title="">[113]</a></sup> Anne sometimes performed with her ladies in the masques herself, occasionally offending members of the audience. In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Vision_of_the_Twelve_Goddesses" id="w">The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses</a></i> of 1604, she played <a href="/wiki/Pallas_Athena" id="w">Pallas Athena</a>, wearing a tunic that some observers regarded as too short; in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Masque_of_Blackness" id="w">The Masque of Blackness</a></i> of 1605, Anne performed while six months pregnant, she and her ladies causing scandal by appearing with their skin painted as &#34;blackamores&#34;. Letter writer <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Carleton" id="w">Dudley Carleton</a> reported that when the Queen afterwards danced with the Spanish ambassador, he kissed her hand &#34;though there was danger it would have left a mark upon his lips&#34;.<sup id="_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#_note-114" title="">[114]</a></sup> Anne commissioned the leading talents of the day to create these masques, including <a href="/wiki/Ben_Jonson" id="w">Ben Jonson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Inigo_Jones" id="w">Inigo Jones</a>.<sup id="_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#_note-115" title="">[115]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Jones, a gifted architect steeped in the latest European taste, also designed the <a href="/wiki/Queen%26%2339%3Bs_House" id="w">Queen&#39;s House</a> at Greenwich for Anne, one of the first true <a href="/wiki/Palladian" id="w">Palladian</a> buildings in England;<sup id="_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#_note-116" title="">[116]</a></sup> and the Dutch inventor <a href="/wiki/Salomon_de_Caus" id="w">Salomon de Caus</a> laid out her gardens at Greenwich and Somerset House. Anne particularly loved music and patronised the lutenist and composer <a href="/wiki/John_Dowland" id="w">John Dowland</a>,<sup id="_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#_note-117" title="">[117]</a></sup> previously employed at her brother&#39;s court in Denmark, as well as &#34;more than a good many&#34; French musicians.<sup id="_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#_note-118" title="">[118]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anne also commissioned artists such as <a href="/wiki/Paul_van_Somer_I" id="w">Paul van Somer</a>,  <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Oliver" id="w">Isaac Oliver</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Mytens" id="w">Daniel Mytens</a>, who led English taste in visual arts for a generation.<sup id="_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#_note-119" title="">[119]</a></sup> Under Anne, the  <a href="/wiki/Royal_Collection" id="w">Royal Collection</a> began once more to expand,<sup id="_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#_note-120" title="">[120]</a></sup> a policy continued by Anne&#39;s son <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" id="w"> Charles</a>.
