The <b>evolutionary history of life</b> and the <a href="/wiki/Origin_of_life" id="w">origin of life</a> are fields of ongoing geological and biological research. Although it is not necessary to understand the origin of life on earth to accept evolution by natural selection,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> the origin of life and its evolutionary history can help shed light on evolutionary processes.

The details of the origin of life are unknown, though the broad principles have been established. It has been proposed that life, or at least organic components, may have arrived on <a href="/wiki/Earth" id="w">Earth</a> from space (see <a href="/wiki/Panspermia" id="w">Panspermia</a>), while others argue that terrestrial origins are more probable. The mechanisms by which life would initially arise are nevertheless held to be similar.<sup id="_ref-Scientific-American-panspermia_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Scientific-American-panspermia" title="">[8]</a></sup> 
The timing of the origin of life is highly speculative—perhaps it arose around four billion years ago.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> 
Somehow, in the energetic chemistry of early Earth, a molecule (or even something else) gained the ability to make copies of itself&#8212;the replicator. The nature of this molecule is unknown, its function having long since been superseded by life’s current replicator, <a href="/wiki/DNA" id="w">DNA</a>. In making copies of itself, the replicator did not always perform accurately; some copies contained an error. If the change destroyed the copying ability of the molecule, there could be no more copies, and the line would die out. On the other hand, a few rare changes might make the molecule replicate faster or better; those strains would become more numerous and successful. As choice raw materials (food) became depleted, strains which could exploit different materials, or perhaps halt the progress of other strains and steal their resources, became more numerous.<sup id="_ref-Dawkins-Ancestors-563_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dawkins-Ancestors-563" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several different models have been proposed explaining how a replicator might have developed. Different replicators have been posited, including organic chemicals such as modern proteins, nucleic acids, <a href="/wiki/Phospholipid" id="w">phospholipids</a>, <a href="/wiki/Crystal" id="w">crystals</a>,<sup id="_ref-Dawkins-Watchmaker-150_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dawkins-Watchmaker-150" title="">[11]</a></sup> or even quantum systems.<sup id="_ref-Davies_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davies" title="">[12]</a></sup> 
There is currently no method of determining which of these models, if any, closely fits the origin of <a href="/wiki/Organism" id="w">life on Earth</a>. One of the older theories, and one which has been worked out in some detail, will serve as an example of how this might occur. </p>
<p>The high energy from volcanoes, <a href="/wiki/Lightning" id="w">lightning</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet_radiation" id="w">ultraviolet radiation</a> could help drive chemical reactions producing more complex molecules from simple compounds such as <a href="/wiki/Methane" id="w">methane</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" id="w">ammonia</a>.<sup id="_ref-Fortey-38_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fortey-38" title="">[13]</a></sup> Among these were many of the relatively simple <a href="/wiki/Organic_chemistry" id="w">organic</a> compounds that are the building blocks of life. As the amount of this “organic soup” increased, different molecules reacted with one another. Sometimes more complex molecules would result&#8212;perhaps <a href="/wiki/Clay" id="w">clay</a> provided a framework to collect and concentrate organic material.<sup id="_ref-Fortey-39_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fortey-39" title="">[14]</a></sup> The presence of certain molecules could <a href="/wiki/Catalyst" id="w">speed up</a> a chemical reaction. All this continued for a very long time, with reactions occurring more or less at random, until by chance there arose a new molecule: the <a href="/wiki/Replicator" id="w">replicator</a>. This had the bizarre property of promoting the chemical reactions which produced a copy of itself, and <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">evolution</a> began properly. </p>
<p>Other theories posit a different replicator. In any case, DNA took over the function of the replicator at some point; all known life (with the exception of some viruses and <a href="/wiki/Prions" id="w">prions</a>) use DNA as their replicator, in an almost identical manner (see <a href="/wiki/Genetic_code" id="w">genetic code</a>).
The first simple, sea dwelling organic structures appeared about 3,400 million years ago. It is considered that they may have formed when certain chemical (organic) molecules joined together.<sup id="_ref-dkvisual_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dkvisual" title="">[15]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Prokaryote" id="w">Prokaryotes</a>, single-celled micro-organisms like blue green algae, were able to photosynthesize and produce <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" id="w">oxygen</a>.

All <a href="/wiki/Organisms" id="w">organisms</a> on <a href="/wiki/Earth" id="w">Earth</a> are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Current species are a stage in the process of evolution, with their diversity the product of a long series of speciation and extinction events.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Common_descent" id="w">common descent</a> of organisms was first deduced from four simple facts about organisms: Firstly, they have geographic distributions that cannot be explained by local adaptation. Secondly, the diversity of life is not a set of completely unique organisms, but organisms that share morphological similarities. Thirdly, vestigial traits with no clear purpose resemble functional ancestral traits, and finally, that organisms can be classified using these similarities into a hierarchy of nested groups.</p>
<p>Past species have also left records of their evolutionary history. <a href="/wiki/Fossil" id="w">Fossils</a>, along with the comparative anatomy of present-day organisms, constitute the morphological, or anatomical, record.<sup id="_ref-Jablonski_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jablonski" title="">[18]</a></sup> By comparing the anatomies of both modern and extinct species, paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species. However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Furthermore, as prokaryotes such as <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" id="w">bacteria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Archaea" id="w">archaea</a> share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.</p>
<p>More recently, evidence for common descent has come from the study of <a href="/wiki/Biochemistry" id="w">biochemical</a> similarities between organisms.

<p>At the start of the era, animal life was confined to <a href="/wiki/Ediacaran_biota" id="w">Ediacaran fauna</a>.

The Mesozoic extended roughly from 251 <a href="/wiki/Mya_(unit)" id="w">Ma</a> to 65 Ma (<a href="/wiki/International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy" id="w">ICS</a> 2004).
The extinction of nearly all animal species at the end of the <a href="/wiki/Permian" id="w">Permian</a> period allowed for the <a href="/wiki/Adaptive_radiation" id="w">radiation</a> of many new lifeforms.  In particular, the extinction of the large <a href="/wiki/Herbivore" id="w">herbivorous</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carnivore" id="w">carnivorous</a> <a href="/wiki/Dinocephalia" id="w">dinocephalia</a> left those <a href="/wiki/Ecological_niche" id="w">ecological niches</a> empty. Some were filled by the surviving <a href="/wiki/Cynodont" id="w">cynodonts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dicynodont" id="w">dicynodonts</a>, the latter of which subsequently became extinct. <a href="/wiki/Animal" id="w">Animal</a> life during the Mesozoic was dominated, however, by large <a href="/wiki/Archosaur" id="w">archosaurian</a> <a href="/wiki/Reptile" id="w">reptiles</a> that appeared a few million years after the Permian extinction: <a href="/wiki/Dinosaur" id="w">dinosaurs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pterosaur" id="w">pterosaurs</a>, and aquatic reptiles such as <a href="/wiki/Ichthyosaur" id="w">ichthyosaurs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plesiosaur" id="w">plesiosaurs</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mosasaur" id="w">mosasaurs</a>.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>The climatic changes of the late Jurassic and Cretaceous provided for further adaptive radiation. The Jurassic was the height of archosaur diversity, and the first <a href="/wiki/Bird" id="w">birds</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eutheria" id="w">placental mammals</a> also appeared. <a href="/wiki/Flowering_plant" id="w">Angiosperms</a> radiated sometime in the early Cretaceous, first in the <a href="/wiki/Tropics" id="w">tropics</a>, but the even temperature gradient allowed them to spread toward the poles throughout the period. By the end of the Cretaceous, angiosperms dominated tree floras in many areas, although some evidence suggests that <a href="/wiki/Biomass" id="w">biomass</a> was still dominated by <a href="/wiki/Cycad" id="w">cycad</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fern" id="w">ferns</a> until after the KT extinction.</p>
<p>Some have argued that <a href="/wiki/Insect" id="w">insects</a> diversified with angiosperms because insect <a href="/wiki/Anatomy" id="w">anatomy</a>, especially the <a href="/wiki/Mouth" id="w">mouth</a> parts, seems particularly well-suited for flowering plants. However, all major insect mouth parts preceded angiosperms and insect diversification actually slowed when they arrived, so their anatomy originally must have been suited for some other purpose.</p>
<p>As the temperatures in the seas increased, the larger animals of the early Mesozoic gradually began to disappear while smaller animals of all kinds, including <a href="/wiki/Lizard" id="w">lizards</a>, <a href="/wiki/Snake" id="w">snakes</a>, and perhaps the ancestor <a href="/wiki/Mammal" id="w">mammals</a> to <a href="/wiki/Primate" id="w">primates</a>, evolved.

As the <a href="/wiki/Dinosaur" id="w">dinosaurs</a> perished at the end of the <a href="/wiki/Cretaceous" id="w">Cretaceous</a> period, the <a href="/wiki/Mammal" id="w">mammals</a> took center stage.

<p>{{Main}}
The Cambrian explosion (542&#8211;530 <a href="/wiki/Annum" id="w">Ma</a>) describes the profound diversification in life on Earth.  Prior to around {{Ma}}, organisms were on the whole simple, comprising of individual cells occasionally organised into colonies.  Over the subsequent 70&#8211;80&#160;million years, evolution would accelerate by an order of magnitude,<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> and the diversity of life would begin to resemble today&#39;s.<sup id="_ref-Bambach2007_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bambach2007" title="">[44]</a></sup>
The fossil record provides us with a few cases of exceptional preservation around the end of this explosion, with famous units such as the <a href="/wiki/Burgess_shale" id="w">Burgess shale</a> offering a glimpse into a bustling yet strikingly different world, in stark contrast to the microbe-dominated seas of just 80 million years before.</p>
<p>The Cambrian explosion has generated extensive scientific debate. The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the &#34;Primordial Strata&#34; was noted as early as the mid 19th century;<sup id="_ref-Buckland1841_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Buckland1841" title="">[45]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Charles_Darwin" id="w">Charles Darwin</a> saw it as one of the principal objections that could be lodged against his theory of <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">evolution</a> by <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" id="w">natural selection</a>.<sup id="_ref-OriginOfSpecies_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OriginOfSpecies" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Cambrian explosion has proven difficult to study, partly because of the problems involved in matching up rocks of the same age across disparate <a href="/wiki/Continent" id="w">continents</a>.  It should be borne in mind that absolute <a href="/wiki/Radiometric_dating" id="w">radiometric</a> dates for much of the Cambrian, obtained by detailed analysis of radioactive elements contained within rocks,  have only rather recently become available<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> and that, especially for the Lower Cambrian, detailed <a href="/wiki/Biostratigraphy" id="w">biostratigraphic</a> correlation&#8212;using widespread but short-lived species to match the ages of rocks&#8212;remains rather <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Tenuous">tenuous</a>, particularly around the internationally-defined <a href="/wiki/Precambrian" id="w">Precambrian</a>/<a href="/wiki/Cambrian" id="w">Cambrian</a> <a href="/wiki/Global_Boundary_Stratotype_Section_and_Point" id="w">boundary section</a> in <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)" id="w">Newfoundland</a>.

<a id="Late_Devonian_extinction" name="Late_Devonian_extinction"></a><h3>Late Devonian extinction</h3>
<p>{{Main}}
The Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems, including the <a href="/wiki/Stromatoporoid" id="w">stromatoporoids</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Rugosa" id="w">rugose</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tabulate_coral" id="w">tabulate corals</a>. The reef system collapse was so severe that major reef-building (effected by new families of carbonate-excreting organisms, the modern scleractinian  corals) did not recover until the Mesozoic era. </p>
<p>The late Devonian crash in <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" id="w">biodiversity</a> was more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the <a href="/wiki/Cretaceous" id="w">Cretaceous</a>: a recent survey (McGhee 1996) estimates that 22 percent of all the <i><a href="/wiki/Family_(biology)" id="w">families</a></i> of marine animals (largely <a href="/wiki/Invertebrate" id="w">invertebrates</a>) were eliminated, the category of families offering a broad range of real structural diversity.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> Some 57 percent of the <a href="/wiki/Genus" id="w">genera</a> went extinct, and&#8212;the estimate most likely to be adjusted&#8212;at least 75 percent of the species did not survive into the following <a href="/wiki/Carboniferous" id="w">Carboniferous</a>. The estimates of species loss depend on surveys of marine taxa that are perhaps not well enough known to assess their true rate of losses, and for the Devonian it is not easy to allow for possible effects of differential preservation and <a href="/wiki/Sampling_bias" id="w">sampling biases</a>. Amongst the severely affected marine groups were the <a href="/wiki/Brachiopod" id="w">brachiopods</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trilobite" id="w">trilobites</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ammonite" id="w">ammonites</a>, <a href="/wiki/Conodont" id="w">conodonts</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Acritarch" id="w">acritarchs</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Agnatha" id="w">jawless fish</a>, and all <a href="/wiki/Placoderm" id="w">placoderms</a>.

The Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event was the catastrophic mass <a href="/wiki/Extinction" id="w">extinction</a> of extant animal species in a comparatively short period of time, approximately 65.5 <a href="/wiki/Mya_(unit)" id="w">million years ago</a>.</p>
<p>Most, if not all, non-avian <a href="/wiki/Dinosaur" id="w">dinosaurs</a> became extinct during or possibly a few years after the event.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> Non-avian dinosaur fossils are not found later than the K–T boundary, except for a few controversial exceptions.  Many other groups of animals and plants, including <a href="/wiki/Mosasaur" id="w">mosasaurs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plesiosaur" id="w">plesiosaurs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pterosaur" id="w">pterosaurs</a>, and some <a href="/wiki/Invertebrate" id="w">invertebrates</a>, also became extinct at the K–T boundary. The event marks the end of the <a href="/wiki/Mesozoic" id="w">Mesozoic</a> Era, and the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Cenozoic" id="w">Cenozoic</a> Era.</p>
<p>Most of the extinctions occurred in a relatively short time because extensive weather changes reduced <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" id="w">photosynthesis</a>, thereby decreasing the amount of plant material available to <a href="/wiki/Herbivore" id="w">herbivorous animals</a>.  This change in food supply caused a massive disruption in Earth&#39;s ecology.</p>
<p>Despite the severity of the K–T extinction event, there was significant variability in the rate of extinction of different classes of organisms.  Organisms which depended on <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" id="w">photosynthesis</a> became extinct or suffered heavy losses due to reduced <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" id="w">sunlight</a>.  Photosynthesizing organisms, from <a href="/wiki/Plankton" id="w">plankton</a> (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Coccolithophorids" id="w">coccolithophorids</a>) to land <a href="/wiki/Plant" id="w">plants</a>, formed the primary part of the food chain in the late Cretaceous.  <a href="/wiki/Herbivores" id="w">Herbivorous</a> animals, which depended on plants and plankton as their food, died out as their food sources became scarce; consequently, top <a href="/wiki/Predators" id="w">predators</a> such as <i><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" id="w">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> also began dying.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup>  
Animals which built <a href="/wiki/Calcium_carbonate" id="w">calcium carbonate</a> shells (for example, coccolithophorids along with many groups of <a href="/wiki/Mollusc" id="w">molluscs</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Ammonite" id="w">ammonites</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rudist" id="w">rudists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fresh_water" id="w">fresh water</a> <a href="/wiki/Snail" id="w">snails</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mussel" id="w">mussels</a>), as well as organisms whose <a href="/wiki/Food_chain" id="w">food chain</a> depended on these <a href="/wiki/Calcium_carbonate" id="w">calcium carbonate</a> shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of <a href="/wiki/Mosasaur" id="w">mosasaurs</a>, a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at the boundary.<sup id="_ref-Kauffman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kauffman" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>Most omnivores, insectivores and <a href="/wiki/Carrion" id="w">carrion</a>-eaters appear to have survived quite well. At the end of the Cretaceous there seem to have been no purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals. Many mammals, and the birds which survived the extinction, fed on <a href="/wiki/Insect" id="w">insects</a>, <a href="/wiki/Larva" id="w">larvae</a>, <a href="/wiki/Worm" id="w">worms</a>, snails, etc., which in turn fed on dead plant matter.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Stream" id="w">stream</a> <a href="/wiki/Biocoenosis" id="w">communities</a> few groups of animals became extinct. Stream communities tend to rely less on food from living plants and more on detritus that washes in from land. This may have buffered them from extinction.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> Similar, but more complex patterns have been found in the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the <a href="/wiki/Pelagic_zone" id="w">water column</a>, than among animals living on or in the sea floor. Animals in the water column are almost entirely dependent on <a href="/wiki/Primary_production" id="w">primary production</a> from living phytoplankton, while many animals living on or in the <a href="/wiki/Ocean_floor" id="w">ocean floor</a> feed on detritus or can switch to detritus feeding.<sup id="_ref-MacLeod_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacLeod" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>The largest air-breathing survivors, <a href="/wiki/Crocodilian" id="w">crocodilians</a> and <a href="/wiki/Champsosaur" id="w">champsosaurs</a>, were semi-aquatic. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers and can survive for months without food.

The Holocene extinction event is a name customarily given to the widespread, ongoing <a href="/wiki/Mass_extinction" id="w">mass extinction</a> of <a href="/wiki/Species" id="w">species</a> during the modern <a href="/wiki/Holocene" id="w">Holocene</a> <a href="/wiki/Epoch_(geology)" id="w">epoch</a>.

Because the rate of this <a href="/wiki/Extinction_event" id="w">extinction event</a> appears to be much more rapid than the &#34;Big Five&#34; mass extinctions, it is also known as the <i>Sixth Extinction</i>.  Since 1500 AD, 784 extinctions have been documented by the <a href="/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature_and_Natural_Resources" id="w">International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources</a>.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup>  However, since most extinctions are likely to go undocumented, scientists estimate that during the last century, between 20,000 and two million species have become extinct, but the precise total cannot be determined more accurately within the limits of present knowledge.  Up to 140,000 species per year (based on <a href="/wiki/Species-area_theory" id="w">Species-area theory</a>)<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> may be the present rate of extinction based upon upper bound estimating.</p>
<p>In broad usage, the Holocene extinction event includes the notable disappearance of large <a href="/wiki/Mammal" id="w">mammals</a>, known as <a href="/wiki/Megafauna" id="w">megafauna</a>, by the end of the <a href="/wiki/Last_ice_age" id="w">last ice age</a> 9,000 to 13,000 years ago.  Such disappearances have been considered as either a response to climate change, a result of the <a href="/wiki/Overpopulation" id="w">proliferation</a> of <a href="/wiki/Modern_human" id="w">modern humans</a>, or both.  These extinctions, occurring near the <a href="/wiki/Pleistocene" id="w">Pleistocene</a> / Holocene boundary, are sometimes referred to as the <i><a href="/wiki/New_World_Pleistocene_Extinctions" id="w">Pleistocene Extinction Event</a></i> or Ice Age extinction event.  However the Holocene extinction event continues through the events of the past several millennia and includes the present time.</p>
<p>The observed rate of extinction has accelerated dramatically in the last 50 years, to a pace greater than the rate seen during the Big Five.  There is no general agreement on whether to consider more recent extinctions as a distinct event or merely part of a single escalating process.  Only during these most recent parts of the extinction have plants also suffered large losses. Overall, the Holocene extinction event is most significantly characterised by the presence of man-made driving factors and its very short <a href="/wiki/Geological_timescale" id="w">geological timescale</a> (tens to thousands of years) compared to most other extinction events.</p>
<p>Significantly, the rate of species extinctions at present is estimated at 100 to 1000 times &#34;background&#34; or average extinction rates in the <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">evolutionary</a> time scale of planet <a href="/wiki/Earth" id="w">Earth</a>.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Prokaryote" name="Prokaryote"></a><h3>Prokaryote</h3>
<p>{{Main}}
It is generally accepted that the <a href="/wiki/Origin_of_life" id="w">first living cells</a> were some form of prokaryote and may have developed out of <a href="/wiki/Protobionts" id="w">protobionts</a>. Fossilized prokaryotes approximately 3.5 billion years old have been discovered, and prokaryotes are the most successful and abundant organism even today. In contrast the eukaryote only appeared between approximately 1.7 and 2.2 billion years ago.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup>  While Earth is the only known place in the universe where life exist, some have suggested structures within a Martian <a href="/wiki/Meteorite" id="w">meteorite</a> should be interpreted as fossil prokaryotes; this is open to considerable debate and skepticism. </p>
<p>Prokaryotes diversified greatly throughout their long existence. The metabolism of prokaryotes is far more varied than that of <a href="/wiki/Eukaryote" id="w">eukaryotes</a>, leading to many highly distinct types of prokaryotes.  For example, in addition to using <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" id="w">photosynthesis</a> or organic compounds for energy like eukaryotes do, prokaryotes may obtain energy from inorganic chemicals such as <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide" id="w">hydrogen sulfide</a>.</p>

The origin of the eukaryotic cell was a milestone in the evolution of life, since they include all complex cells and almost all multi-cellular organisms. The timing of this series of events is hard to determine; Knoll (1992) suggests they developed approximately 1.6 to 2.1 billion years ago.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> Fossils that are clearly related to modern groups start appearing around 1.2 billion years ago, in the form of a <a href="/wiki/Red_algae#Fossil record" id="w">red alga</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/RRNA" id="w">rRNA</a> trees constructed during the 1980s and 1990s left most eukaryotes in an unresolved &#34;crown&#34; group (not technically a true <a href="/wiki/Crown_group" id="w">crown</a>), which was usually divided by the form of the mitochondrial cristae.  The few groups that lack mitochondria branched separately and so the absence was believed to be primitive, but this is now considered an artifact of <a href="/wiki/Long_branch_attraction" id="w">long branch attraction</a> and they are known to have lost them secondarily.</p>
<p>Trees based on <a href="/wiki/Actin" id="w">actin</a> and other molecules have painted a different and more complete picture.  Most eukaryotes are now included in several supergroups:</p>

<p>Several authorities recognize two larger clades, the <a href="/wiki/Unikont" id="w">unikonts</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Bikont" id="w">bikonts</a>, the unikonts deriving from an ancestral uniflagellar organism, and the bikonts deriving from an ancestral biflagellate.  In this system, the opisthokonts and amoebozoans are considered unikonts, and the rest are considered bikonts.  The chromists and alveolates may be part of a larger group that is ancestrally photosynthetic, called the <a href="/wiki/Chromalveolate" id="w">chromalveolates</a>, but this remains contentious.  Some small protist groups have not been related to any of these supergroups, in particular the <a href="/wiki/Centrohelid" id="w">centrohelids</a>.
Eukaryotes are closely related to <a href="/wiki/Archaea" id="w">Archaea</a>, at least in terms of nuclear DNA and genetic machinery, and are placed by some, along with the Archaea, in the clade <a href="/wiki/Neomura" id="w">Neomura</a>.  In other respects, such as membrane composition, they are similar to <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" id="w">eubacteria</a>.  Three main explanations for this have been proposed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eukaryotes resulted from the complete fusion of two or more cells, the cytoplasm forming from a eubacterium and the nucleus from an archaeon (<a href="/wiki/Viral_Eukaryogenesis" id="w">alternatively</a> a virus).</li>
<li>Eukaryotes developed from Archaea, and acquired their eubacterial characteristics from the proto-mitochondrion.</li>
<li>Eukaryotes and Archaea developed separately from a modified eubacterium.</li></ul>
<p>The final hypothesis is currently the most accepted.
The origin of the endomembrane system and mitochondria are also disputed.  The <i>phagotrophic hypothesis</i> states the membranes originated with the development of endocytosis and later specialized; mitochondria were acquired by ingestion, like plastids.  The <i>syntrophic hypothesis</i> states that the proto-eukaryote relied on the proto-mitochondrion for food, and so ultimately grew to surround it; the membranes originate later, in part thanks to mitochondrial genes (the <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_hypothesis" id="w">hydrogen hypothesis</a> is one particular version).</p>
<a id="Archaea" name="Archaea"></a><h3>Archaea</h3>
<p>{{Main}}
The Archaea are a major group of <a href="/wiki/Microorganism" id="w">microorganisms</a>. Archaea are similar to other <a href="/wiki/Prokaryote" id="w">prokaryotes</a> in most aspects of <a href="/wiki/Cell_(biology)" id="w">cell</a> structure and <a href="/wiki/Metabolism" id="w">metabolism</a>. However, their genetic <a href="/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)" id="w">transcription</a> and <a href="/wiki/Translation_(genetics)" id="w">translation</a>&#8212;the two central processes in <a href="/wiki/Molecular_biology" id="w">molecular biology</a>&#8212;do not show many typical bacterial features, and are in many aspects similar to those of <a href="/wiki/Eukaryote" id="w">eukaryotes</a>. For instance, archaean translation uses eukaryotic-like initiation and elongation factors, and their transcription involves <a href="/wiki/TATA_Binding_Protein" id="w">TATA Binding Proteins</a> and TFIIB as in eukaryotes. Many archaeal tRNA and rRNA genes harbor unique archaeal <a href="/wiki/Introns" id="w">introns</a> which are neither like eukaryotic introns, nor like bacterial (type I and type II etc which can &#34;home&#34;) introns.</p>
<p>Archaea were identified in 1977 by <a href="/wiki/Carl_Woese" id="w">Carl Woese</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_E._Fox" id="w">George E. Fox</a> as being a separate branch based on their separation from other prokaryotes on 16S <a href="/wiki/RRNA" id="w">rRNA</a> <a href="/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree" id="w">phylogenetic trees</a>.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> These two groups were originally named the Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, treated as <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_(biology)" id="w">kingdoms</a> or subkingdoms, which Woese and Fox termed Urkingdoms. Woese argued that they represented fundamentally different branches of living things. He later renamed the groups Archaea and <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" id="w">Bacteria</a> to emphasize this, and argued that together with <a href="/wiki/Eukaryota" id="w">Eukarya</a> they compose <a href="/wiki/Three-domain_system" id="w">three Domains</a> of living organisms.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Archaea should not be confused with the <a href="/wiki/Geological" id="w">geological</a> term <i><a href="/wiki/Archean" id="w">Archean</a> eon</i>, also known as the <i>Archeozoic era</i>. This refers to the primordial period of <a href="/wiki/Earth" id="w">Earth</a> history when Archaea and Bacteria were the only <a href="/wiki/Cell_(biology)" id="w">cellular</a> organisms living on the planet.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> Probable <a href="/wiki/Fossils" id="w">fossils</a> of these <a href="/wiki/Microorganism" id="w">microbes</a> have been dated to almost 3.5 billion years ago.</p>
<a id="Evolution_of_sex" name="Evolution_of_sex"></a><h2> Evolution of sex </h2>
<p>{{Main}}</p>
<p>The evolution of sex is a major puzzle. The first <a href="/wiki/Fossil" id="w">fossilized</a> evidence of sexually reproducing <a href="/wiki/Organism" id="w">organisms</a> is from <a href="/wiki/Eukaryote" id="w">eukaryotes</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Stenian" id="w">Stenian</a> period, about 1.2 to 1 billion years ago with <a href="/wiki/DNA" id="w">DNA</a> forming 3.5 to 4.6 billion years.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> Sexual reproduction is the primary method of reproduction for the vast majority of visible organisms, including almost all <a href="/wiki/Animal" id="w">animals</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plant" id="w">plants</a>. <a href="/wiki/Bacterial_conjugation" id="w">Bacterial conjugation</a>, the transfer of <a href="/wiki/DNA" id="w">DNA</a> between two <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" id="w">bacteria</a>, is often mistakenly confused with sexual reproduction, because the mechanics are similar.</p>
<p>A major question is why sexual reproduction persists when <a href="/wiki/Parthenogenesis" id="w">parthenogenesis</a> appears in some ways to be a superior form of <a href="/wiki/Reproduction" id="w">reproduction</a>. Contemporary evolutionary thought proposes some explanations. It may be  due to selection pressure on the <a href="/wiki/Clade" id="w">clade</a> itself—the ability for a population to radiate more rapidly due to a changing environment through sexual recombination than parthenogenesis allows. Alternatively, sexual reproduction may allow for the &#39;ratcheting&#39; of evolutionary speed as one clade competes with another for a limited resource.</p>
<p>Organisms need to replicate their genetic material in an efficient and reliable manner. The necessity to repair genetic damage is one of the leading theories explaining the origin of sexual reproduction. <a href="/wiki/Diploid" id="w">Diploid</a> individuals can repair a mutated section of its DNA via <a href="/wiki/Homologous_recombination" id="w">homologous recombination</a>, since there are two copies of the gene in the cell and one copy is presumed to be undamaged. A mutation in an <a href="/wiki/Haploid" id="w">haploid</a> individual, on the other hand, is more likely to become resident, as the <a href="/wiki/DNA_repair" id="w">DNA repair</a> machinery has no way of knowing what the original undamaged sequence was.<sup id="_ref-dna-repair_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dna-repair" title="">[81]</a></sup>  The most primitive form of sex may have been one organism with damaged DNA replicating an undamaged strand from a similar organism in order to repair itself.<sup id="_ref-tatiana_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tatiana" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another theory is that sexual reproduction originated from <a href="/wiki/Selfish_DNA" id="w">selfish parasitic genetic elements</a> that exchange genetic material (that is: copies of their own genome) for their transmission and propagation. In some organisms, sexual reproduction has been shown to enhance the spread of parasitic genetic elements (e.g. yeast, filamentous fungi).<sup id="_ref-hickey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hickey" title="">[83]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Bacterial_conjugation" id="w">Bacterial conjugation</a>, a form of genetic exchange that some sources describe as sex, is not a form of reproduction.  However, it does support the selfish genetic element theory, as it is propagated through such a &#34;selfish gene&#34;, the <a href="/wiki/F-plasmid" id="w">F-plasmid</a>.<sup id="_ref-tatiana_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tatiana" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>
<p>A third theory is that sex evolved as a form of cannibalism.  One primitive organism ate another one, but rather than completely digesting it, some of the &#39;eaten&#39; organism&#39;s DNA was incorporated into the &#39;eater&#39; organism.<sup id="_ref-tatiana_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tatiana" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>
<p>A theory states that sexual reproduction evolved from ancient <a href="/wiki/Haloarchaea" id="w">haloarchaea</a> through a combination of <a href="/wiki/Jumping_genes" id="w">jumping genes</a>, and swapping <a href="/wiki/Plasmid" id="w">plasmids</a>.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p>A comprehensive <i>origin of sex as vaccination</i> theory proposes that eukaryan sex-as-syngamy (fusion sex) arose from prokaryan unilateral sex-as-infection when infected hosts began swapping nuclearized genomes containing coevolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that provided protection against horizontal superinfection by more virulent symbionts. Sex-as-meiosis (fission sex) then evolved as a host strategy to uncouple (and thereby emasculate) the acquired symbiont genomes.<sup id="_ref-sterrer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sterrer" title="">[85]</a></sup></p>
