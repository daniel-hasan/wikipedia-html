Originating in 1951 as the High Authority, the Commission has undergone numerous changes in power and composition under eleven Presidents.<sup id="_ref-ENA commission history_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ENA commission history" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The first Commission originated in 1951 as the nine-member &#34;High Authority&#34; under President <a href="/wiki/Jean_Monnet" id="w">Jean Monnet</a>. The Authority was the <a href="/wiki/Supranational" id="w">supranational</a> administrative executive of the new <a href="/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community" id="w">European Coal and Steel Community</a> (ECSC). In 1958 the <a href="/wiki/Treaties_of_Rome" id="w">Treaties of Rome</a> established two new communities along side the ECSC: the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Community" id="w">European Economic Community</a> (EEC) and the <a href="/wiki/European_Atomic_Energy_Community" id="w">European Atomic Energy Community</a> (Euratom). However the executives were called &#34;Commissions&#34; rather than &#34;High Authorities&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ENA commission history_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ENA commission history" title="">[2]</a></sup> The reason for the change in name was the new relationship between the executive and the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union" id="w">Council</a>. Some states such as <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> expressed reservations over the power of the High Authority and wished to limit it giving more power to the Council rather than the new executives.<sup id="_ref-ENA Council history_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ENA Council history" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Walter_Hallstein" id="w">Walter Hallstein</a> led the first Commission of the EEC and achieved agreement on a contentious cereal price accord in the wake of <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle" id="w">Charles de Gaulle</a>&#39;s veto of <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> membership as well as making a positive impression upon third countries when the Commission made its international debut at the <a href="/wiki/Kennedy_Round" id="w">Kennedy Round</a>.

<p>One of the most successful Commissions was that headed by <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Delors" id="w">Jacques Delors</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Delors_Commission" id="w">Delors Commission</a>), with later Presidents failing to meet the same success. Delors was credited with giving the Community a sense of direction and dynamism.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Delors and his team are also considered as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Founding_father" id="w">founding fathers</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Euro" id="w">euro</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Meet Delors_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meet Delors" title="">[13]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/International_Herald_Tribune" id="w">International Herald Tribune</a> noted the work of Delors at the end of his second term in 1992: &#34;Mr. Delors rescued the European Community from the doldrums. He arrived when Europessimism was at its worst. Although he was a little-known former French finance minister, he breathed life and hope into the EC and into the dispirited Brussels Commission. In his first term, from 1985 to 1988, he rallied Europe to the call of the single market, and when appointed to a second term he began urging Europeans toward the far more ambitious goals of economic, monetary and political union.&#34;<sup id="_ref-IHT Delors quote_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IHT Delors quote" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The successor to Delors was <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Santer" id="w">Jacques Santer</a>. However the entire <a href="/wiki/Santer_Commission" id="w">Santer Commission</a> was forced to resign in 1999 by the Parliament following allegations of fraud. That was the first time Commission had been forced to resigned <i>en mass</i> and represented a shift towards the Parliament.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> However the Santer Commission did carry out work on the <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam_Treaty" id="w">Amsterdam Treaty</a> and the euro.<sup id="_ref-Meet Santer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meet Santer" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Recent_commissions" name="Recent_commissions"></a><h2>Recent commissions</h2>
<p>Following Santer, <a href="/wiki/Romano_Prodi" id="w">Romano Prodi</a> took office.

<p>In 2004 <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Manuel_Barroso" id="w">José Manuel Barroso</a> became President, however the Parliament once again asserted itself in objecting to the proposed membership of the <a href="/wiki/Barroso_Commission" id="w">Barroso Commission</a>.

The Commission was set up from the start to act as an independent supranational authority separate from governments, it has been described as &#34;the only body paid to think European&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Day_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Day" title="">[20]</a></sup> The members are proposed by their member state governments, one from each, however they are bound to act independently &#8211; neutral from other influences such as those governments which appointed them. This is in contrast to the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union" id="w">Council</a>, which represents governments, and the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" id="w">Parliament</a>, which represents <a href="/wiki/EU_citizen" id="w">citizens</a>.<sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="Executive_power" name="Executive_power"></a><h2>Executive power</h2>
<p>Executive power of the Union is held by the Council, it confers on the Commission such powers for it to exercise. However the Council may withdraw these powers, exercising them directly, or impose conditions on their use.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> Powers are outlined in Articles 211–219 of the EC treaty<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> and are more restricted than most national executives, in part due to  the Commission&#39;s lack of power over areas like <a href="/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy" id="w">foreign policy</a> &#8211; that power is held by the <a href="/wiki/European_Council" id="w">European Council</a>, which some analyses have described as another executive.<sup id="_ref-dragoman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dragoman" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Considering that under the <a href="/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty" id="w">Lisbon Treaty</a> the European Council would become a formal institution with the power of appointing the Commission, it could be said that the two bodies hold the executive power of the Union (the European Council also holds individual national executive powers). However, it is the Commission which currently holds executive powers over the <a href="/wiki/European_Community" id="w">European Community</a>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dragoman_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dragoman" title="">[24]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Government" id="w">governmental</a> powers of the Commission have been such that some such as former <a href="/wiki/Belgian_Prime_Minister" id="w">Belgian Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Guy_Verhofstadt" id="w">Guy Verhofstadt</a> have suggested changing its name to the &#34;European Government&#34;, calling the present name of commission: <i>&#34;ridiculous&#34;</i>.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Legislative_initiative" name="Legislative_initiative"></a><h2>Legislative initiative</h2>
<p>The Commission differs from the other institutions in that it alone has <a href="/wiki/Legislative_initiative" id="w">legislative initiative</a> over the European Community, meaning only the Commission can make formal proposals for legislation &#8211; <a href="/wiki/Bill_(proposed_law)" id="w">bills</a> cannot originate in the legislative branch. It shares this right with the Council over the <a href="/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy" id="w">CFSP pillar</a>, and has no right over <a href="/wiki/Police_and_Judicial_Co-operation_in_Criminal_Matters" id="w">Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters</a>. In the Community however, Council and Parliament are able to request legislation; in most cases the Commission initiates the basis of these proposals, this monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of <a href="/wiki/Law_of_the_European_Union" id="w">Union law</a>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right, with most national parliaments holding the right in some respects.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Under the Lisbon Treaty, EU citizens would also be able to request the Commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures, but it would not be binding.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Commission&#39;s powers in proposing law have usually centred on economic regulation. It has put forward a large number of regulations and they are based on a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Precautionary_principle" id="w">precautionary principle</a>&#34;. This means that pre-emptive regulation takes place if there is a credible hazard to the environment or human health: for example on tackling <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" id="w">climate change</a> and restricting <a href="/wiki/Genetically_modified_organisms" id="w">genetically modified organisms</a>. This is opposed to weighting regulations on the effect on the economy. Thus, the Commission have produced stricter a larger number of regulations that other countries, due to the size of the European market this has meant many regulator of the global market.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Recently the Commission has moved into creating <a href="/wiki/Law_of_the_European_Union#Criminal law" id="w">European criminal law</a>. In 2006, an <a href="/wiki/2006_C%C3%B4te_d%26%2339%3BIvoire_toxic_waste_spill" id="w">toxic waste spill off the coast of Côte d&#39;Ivoire</a>, from a European ship, prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste. Some EU states at that time did not even have a crime against shipping toxic waste leading to the Commissioners <a href="/wiki/Franco_Frattini" id="w">Franco Frattini</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stavros_Dimas" id="w">Stavros Dimas</a> to put forward the idea of &#34;ecological crimes&#34;. Their right to propose criminal law was challenged in the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice" id="w">European Court of Justice</a> but upheld. As of 2007, the only other criminal law proposals which have been brought forward are on the <a href="/wiki/Proposed_directive_on_criminal_measures_aimed_at_ensuring_the_enforcement_of_intellectual_property_rights" id="w">intellectual property rights directive</a>,<sup id="_ref-E!Sharp0507 Legal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-E!Sharp0507 Legal" title="">[32]</a></sup> and on an amendment to the 2002 counter-terrorism framework decision, outlawing terrorism‑related incitement, recruitment (especially via the internet) and training.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Enforcement" name="Enforcement"></a><h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>Once legislation is passed, it is the Commission&#39;s responsibility to ensure it is implemented. It does this through the member states or through its <a href="/wiki/Agencies_of_the_European_Union" id="w">agencies</a>. In adopting the necessary technical measures, the Commission is assisted by committees made up of representatives of member states (a process known in jargon as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Comitology" id="w">comitology</a>&#34;).<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Furthermore, the Commission is responsible for the implementation of the <a href="/wiki/EU_budget" id="w">EU budget</a>; ensuring, along with the <a href="/wiki/Court_of_Auditors" id="w">Court of Auditors</a>, that EU funds are correctly spent.</p>
<p>In particular the Commission has a duty to ensure the treaties and law are upheld, potentially by taking member states or other institutions to the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice" id="w">Court of Justice</a> in a dispute. In this role it is known informally as the &#34;guardian of the treaties&#34;.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> Finally, the Commission provides some <a href="/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_the_European_Union" id="w">external representation</a> for the Union, along side the member states and the <a href="/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy" id="w">Common Foreign and Security Policy</a>, representing the Union in bodies such as the <a href="/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation" id="w">World Trade Organisation</a>.

The <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission" id="w">President of the Commission</a> is first nominated by the European Council; that nominee is then officially elected by the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" id="w">European Parliament</a>. The candidate selected by the Council has often been a leading national politician but this is not a requirement. In 2004, the proposed Constitution had included a provision that the choice of President must take into account the latest <a href="/wiki/Elections_in_the_European_Union" id="w">Parliamentary elections</a>. That provision was not in force in the nomination in 2004, but the centre-right parties of the EU pressured for a candidate from their own ranks. In the end, a right-wing candidate was chosen: <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Manuel_Barroso" id="w">José Manuel Barroso</a> of the <a href="/wiki/European_People%26%2339%3Bs_Party" id="w">European People&#39;s Party</a>.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> There are further criteria influencing the choice of the Council, these include: which area of Europe the candidate comes from, favoured as Southern Europe in 2004; the candidate&#39;s political influence, credible yet not overpowering members; language, proficiency in French considered necessary by France; and degree of integration, their state being a member of both the <a href="/wiki/Eurozone" id="w">eurozone</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Schengen_Agreement" id="w">Schengen Agreement</a>.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> In 2004, this system produced a number of candidates<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> and was thus criticised by some MEPs: following the drawn-out selection, the <a href="/wiki/Alliance_of_Liberals_and_Democrats" id="w">ALDE group</a> leader described the procedure as a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Justus_Lipsius_building" id="w">Justus Lipsius</a> carpet market&#34; producing only the &#34;lowest common denominator&#34;; while <a href="/wiki/European_Greens%E2%80%93European_Free_Alliance" id="w">Green-EFA</a> co-leader <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Cohn-Bendit" id="w">Daniel Cohn-Bendit</a> asked Barroso after his first speech &#34;If you are the best candidate, why were you not the first?&#34;<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following their appointment, the President appoints a number of <a href="/wiki/Vice-President_of_the_European_Commission" id="w">Vice-Presidents</a> among the <a href="/wiki/European_Commissioner" id="w">Commissioners</a>. At present there are five, with <a href="/wiki/Margot_Wallstr%C3%B6m" id="w">Margot Wallström</a> as the current &#34;First&#34; Vice President. For the most part, the position grants little extra power to Vice-Presidents, except the first Vice-President who stands in for the President when he is away. The Commission is composed of a college of &#34;<a href="/wiki/European_Commissioner" id="w">Commissioners</a>&#34;, 27 members in all, including the President and vice-presidents. Even though each member is appointed by a national government, one per state, they do not represent their state in the Commission. One proposed, the President delegates portfolios between each of the members. The power of a Commissioner largely depends upon their portfolio. For example, while the <a href="/wiki/European_Commissioner_for_Education%2C_Training_and_Culture" id="w">Culture Commissioner</a> isn&#39;t a very important figure, the <a href="/wiki/European_Commissioner_for_Competition" id="w">Competition Commissioner</a> is a powerful position with global reach.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> Before the Commission can assume office, the college as a whole must be approved by the Parliament.<sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The present Commission, the <a href="/wiki/Barroso_Commission" id="w">Barroso Commission</a>, took office in late 2004 after being delayed by objections from the Parliament which forced a reshuffle. In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members with the accession of <a href="/wiki/Romania" id="w">Romania</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria" id="w">Bulgaria</a> who each appointed their own Commissioners. With the increasing size of the Commission, President Barroso has adopted a more Presidential style of control over the college, which has earned him some criticism.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> Furthermore, there has also been a greater degree of <a href="/wiki/European_Commissioner#Politicisation" id="w">politicisation within the Commission</a>, this being welcomed by Commissioner Wallström as necessary for citizens&#39; engagement in European affairs.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>

The Commission also operates out of <a href="/wiki/Brussels_and_the_European_Union" id="w">numerous other buildings in Brussels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Luxembourg_(city)" id="w">Luxembourg</a>.<sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> The Commission is divided into departments known as <a href="/wiki/Directorate-General" id="w">Directorates-General</a> (DGs) that can be likened to departments or <a href="/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)" id="w">ministries</a>. Each covers a specific policy area or service such as External relations or Translation and is headed by Director-General who is responsible to a Commissioner. A Commissioner&#39;s portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs, they prepare proposals for them and if approved by a majority of Commissioners it goes forward to Parliament and Council for consideration.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions" title="">[1]</a></sup> There has been criticism from a number of people that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a considerable about of time in <a href="/wiki/Turf_war" id="w">turf wars</a> as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other. Furthermore the DGs can exercise considerable control over a Commissioner with the Commissioner having little time to learn to assert control over their staff.<sup id="_ref-LEM_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LEM" title="">[49]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Press Releases_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Press Releases" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to figures published by the Commission, 23,043 persons were employed by the Commission as officials and temporary agents in April 2007. In addition to these, 9019 &#34;external staff&#34; (e.g. Contractual agents, detached national experts, young experts etc) were employed. The single largest DG is the <a href="/wiki/Directorate-General_for_Translation_(European_Commission)" id="w">Directorate-General for Translation</a>, with a 2186-strong staff, while the largest group by nationality is <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgian</a> (21.4%), probably due to a majority (16,626) of staff being based in the country.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/European_Civil_Service" id="w">Commission&#39;s civil service</a> is headed by a <a href="/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_European_Commission" id="w">Secretary General</a>, currently <a href="/wiki/Catherine_Day" id="w">Catherine Day</a>.<sup id="_ref-Day_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Day" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Press Room in the Berlaymont</div>
Communication with the press is handled by the <a href="/wiki/Directorate-General_Communication_(European_Commission)" id="w">Directorate-General Communication</a>. The Commission&#39;s chief <a href="/wiki/Spokesperson" id="w">spokesperson</a> is Johannes Laitenberger who takes the midday <a href="/wiki/Mass_media" id="w">press</a> briefings, commonly known as the &#34;Midday Presser&#34;. It takes place every weekday in the Commission&#39;s press room at the Berlaymont where journalists may ask questions of Commission officials on any topic and legitimately expect to get an &#34;on the record&#34; answer for live TV. Such a situation is unique in the world.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> There is a greater number of press corps in Brussels than <a href="/wiki/Washington_D.C." id="w">Washington D.C.</a>; media outlets in every Union member-state have a Brussels <a href="/wiki/Correspondent" id="w">correspondent</a>.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>It has been noted by one researcher that the press releases issued by the Commission are uniquely political. A release often goes through several stages of drafting which emphasises the role of the Commission and is used &#34;for justifying the EU and the commission&#34; increasing their length and complexity. Where there are multiple departments involved a press release can also be a source of competition between areas of the Commission and Commissioner&#39;s themselves. This also leads to an unusually high number of press releases, 1907 for 2006, and is seen as a unique product of the EU&#39;s political set-up.<sup id="_ref-Press Releases_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Press Releases" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Legitimacy" name="Legitimacy"></a><h1>Legitimacy</h1>
<p>It is argued by some that the method of appointment for the Commission increases the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_deficit_in_the_European_Union" id="w">democratic deficit in the European Union</a>.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> While the Commission is the executive branch, the candidates are chosen primarily by the 27 national governments, meaning it is hard for the Commission to be thrown out directly by the voters. The legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the Parliament along with Parliament&#39;s power to sack the body, however there has been less than 50% turnout in the Parliament&#39;s elections <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election%2C_1999" id="w">since 1999</a>. While higher than some national elections, including the <a href="/wiki/US_Congress" id="w">US Congress</a>, the fact that there are no direct elections to the Commission President like in the US makes the post less legitimate in the eyes of the public.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> A further problem is the lack of a coherent electorate, even though democratic structures and methods are developing there is not such a mirror in creating a European <a href="/wiki/Civil_society" id="w">civil society</a>.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> The new <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon" id="w">Treaty of Lisbon</a> could go some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> Under the plans of Vice President Wallström, <a href="/wiki/European_political_parties" id="w">European political parties</a> would gain greater prominence and could lead to the Commission President being elected via the <a href="/wiki/Elections_in_the_European_Union" id="w">Parliament&#39;s elections</a>.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>The alternative viewpoint on the Commission states that the policy areas in which it has power to initiate legislation are ill suited to an institution accountable to electoral pressures. In this respect the Commission has been compared with institutions such as independent <a href="/wiki/Central_Bank" id="w">Central Banks</a> which deal with technical areas of policy that are of little electoral salience. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Future_of_the_Commission" name="Future_of_the_Commission"></a><h1>Future of the Commission</h1>
<p>The proposed <a href="/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty" id="w">Lisbon Treaty</a>, the details of which were agreed in June 2007, largely retains the reforms outlined in the rejected <a href="/wiki/Treaty_establishing_a_Constitution_for_Europe" id="w">Constitutional Treaty</a>.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> The constitution&#39;s reforms proposed a number of changes, notably the number of Commissioners would be reduced; from <a href="/wiki/2014" id="w">2014</a> only two out of three member-states would have the right to representation. The representation would be rotated equally between all states and  no state would have more than two in any single Commission. The Commission would also include the new <a href="/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy" id="w">High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy</a>, as one of the Vice Presidents, replacing the <a href="/wiki/European_Commissioner_for_External_Relations" id="w">External Relations Commissioner</a>. The High Representative would have been called the &#34;Union Foreign Minister&#34; &#8211; the first time a member of the Commission held the common national title of &#34;Minister&#34;. In the appointment of the Commission, the most recent European elections would have to be taken into account. It is thought this would create a stronger link between the elections and the Commission, however the President would still be proposed by the Council. Although when the Parliament votes on the Commission, the treaty changes the term &#34;approve&#34; to &#34;elect&#34; in referring to the vote: it is unknown yet if this will produce practical change.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
