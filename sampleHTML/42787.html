<p>The beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Neolithic_period" id="w">Neolithic period</a> is marked by the ceramics of the Narva culture, appear in Estonia at the beginning of the 5th millennium. The oldest finds date from around 4900 B.C. The first pottery was made of thick clay mixed with pebbles, shells or plants. The Narva type ceramics are found throughout almost the entire Estonian coastal region and on the islands. The stone and bone tools of the era have a notable similarity with the artifacts of the Kunda culture.

<p>The beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Age" id="w">Bronze Age</a> in Estonia is dated to approximately 1800 B.C. The development of the borders between the <a href="/wiki/Finnic_peoples" id="w">Finnic peoples</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Balts" id="w">Balts</a> was under way. The first fortified settlements, Asva and Ridala on the island of <a href="/wiki/Saaremaa" id="w">Saaremaa</a> and Iru in the Northern Estonia began to be built. The development of shipbuilding facilitated the spread of bronze. Changes took place in burial customs, a new type of burial ground spread from Germanic to Estonian areas, stone cist graves and cremation burials became increasingly common aside small number of boat-shaped stone graves. <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_Iron_Age" name="The_Iron_Age"></a><h2>The Iron Age</h2>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Pre-Roman_Iron_Age" id="w">Pre-Roman Iron Age</a> began in Estonia about 500 B.C. and lasted until the middle of the 1.st century A.D. The oldest iron items were imported, although since the first century iron was smelted from local marsh and lake ore. Settlement sites were located mostly in places that offered natural protection. Fortresses were built, although used temporarily. The appearance of square <a href="/wiki/Celtic_fields" id="w">Celtic fields</a> surrounded by enclosures in Estonia date from the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The majority of stones with man-made indents, which presumably were connected with magic designed to increase crop fertility, date from this period. A new type of grave, quadrangular burial mounds began to develop. Burial traditions show the clear beginning of social stratification.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Roman_Iron_Age" id="w">Roman Iron Age</a> in Estonia is roughly dated to between 50 and 450 A.D., the era that was affected by the influence of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Roman Empire</a>. In material culture this is reflected by few Roman coins, some <a href="/wiki/Jewellery" id="w">jewellery</a> and artefacts. The abundance of iron artefacts in Southern Estonia speaks of closer mainland ties with southern areas while the islands of western and northern Estonia communicated with their neighbors mainly by sea. By the end of the period three clearly defined tribal dialectical areas: Northern Estonia, Southern Estonia, and Western Estonia including the islands had emerged, the population of each having formed its own understanding of identity.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

In the first centuries CE political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia. Two larger subdivisions appeared: the parish (kihelkond) and the county (maakond). The parish consisted of several villages. Nearly all parishes had at least one fortress. The defense of the local area was directed by the highest official, the parish elder. The county was composed of several parishes, also headed by an elder. By the 13th century the following major counties had developed in Estonia: <a href="/wiki/Saare_County" id="w">Saaremaa</a> (Osilia), <a href="/wiki/L%C3%A4%C3%A4nemaa" id="w">Läänemaa</a> (Rotalia or Maritima), <a href="/wiki/Harjumaa" id="w">Harjumaa</a> (Harria), <a href="/wiki/R%C3%A4vala" id="w">Rävala</a> (Revalia), <a href="/wiki/Virumaa" id="w">Virumaa</a> (Vironia), <a href="/wiki/J%C3%A4rvamaa" id="w">Järvamaa</a> (Jervia), <a href="/wiki/Sakala" id="w">Sakala</a> (Saccala), and <a href="/wiki/Ugandi" id="w">Ugandi</a> (Ugaunia).<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<a id="The_Reformation_Period" name="The_Reformation_Period"></a><h1>The Reformation Period</h1>

<p>The Reformation in  Europe began in 1517 with Martin Luther (1483-1546) and his 95 Theses. </p>
<p>The Reformation resulted in great change in the Baltic.  Ideas entered the Livonian Confederation very quickly and by the 1520’s they were well known.  Language, education, religion, and politics were greatly transformed.  The Church services were now given in the local vernacular, instead of Latin, as was previously used. <sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>By 1819, the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_provinces" id="w">Baltic provinces</a> were the first in the Russian empire in which serfdom was abolished, the largely autonomous nobility allowing the peasants to own their own land or move to the cities.

<p><b>Estophile Enlightenment Period (1750-1840)</b><br/>
Educated German immigrants and local <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Germans" id="w">Baltic Germans</a> in Estonia, educated at German universities introduced <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" id="w">Enlightenment ideas</a> of rational thinking, ideas that propagated freedom of thinking and brotherhood and equality. The <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" id="w">French Revolution</a> provided a powerful motive for the enlightened local upper class to create literature for the peasantry. <sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> The freeing of the peasantry from serfdom on the nobles estates in 1816 in Southern Estonia:<a href="/wiki/Governorate_of_Livonia" id="w">Governorate of Livonia</a> (Russian: Лифляндская губерния) and 1819 in Northern Estonia: <a href="/wiki/Governorate_of_Estonia" id="w">Governorate of Estonia</a> (Russian: Эстляндская губерния) by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Russia" id="w">Alexander I of Russia</a> gave rise to a debate as to the future fate of the former enslaved peoples.

<p>A cultural movement sprang forth to adopt the use of <a href="/wiki/Estonian_language" id="w">Estonian</a> as the language of instruction in schools, all-Estonian song festivals were held regularly after 1869, and a national literature in Estonian developed. &#34;<a href="/wiki/Kalevipoeg" id="w">Kalevipoeg</a>&#34;, Estonia&#39;s national epic, was published in 1861 in both Estonian and German.</p>
<p>1889 marked the beginning of the central government-sponsored policy of <a href="/wiki/Russification" id="w">Russification</a>. The impact of this was that many of the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_German" id="w">Baltic German</a> legal institutions were either abolished or had to do their work in Russian - a good example of this is the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Tartu" id="w">University of Tartu</a>.</p>

Estonia as a unified political entity first emerged after the Russian <a href="/wiki/February_Revolution" id="w">February Revolution</a> of 1917.

<a id="Republic_of_Estonia" name="Republic_of_Estonia"></a><h1>Republic of Estonia</h1>
<p>The first period of independence lasted 22 years, beginning in 1918. Estonia underwent a number of economic, social, and political reforms necessary to come to terms with its new status as a <a href="/wiki/Sovereignty" id="w">sovereign</a> <a href="/wiki/State" id="w">state</a>. Economically and socially, land reform in 1919 was the most important step. Large estate holdings belonging to the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_nobility" id="w">Baltic nobility</a> were redistributed among the peasants and especially among volunteers in the <a href="/wiki/Estonian_War_of_Independence" id="w">Estonian War of Independence</a>.  Estonia&#39;s principal markets became <a href="/wiki/Scandinavia" id="w">Scandinavia</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>, and western Europe, with some exports to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and to the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a>.</p>
<p>The first constitution of the Republic of Estonia, adopted in 1920, established a <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary" id="w">parliamentary</a> form of government.  The parliament (<i><a href="/wiki/Riigikogu" id="w">Riigikogu</a></i>) consisted of 100 members elected for 3-year terms. Between 1921 and 1931, Estonia had 11 governments. </p>
<p>A mass anticommunist and antiparliamentary <a href="/wiki/Vaps_Movement" id="w">Vaps Movement</a> emerged in the 1930s<sup id="_ref-EB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EB" title="">[24]</a></sup>
In October <a href="/wiki/1933" id="w">1933</a> <a href="/wiki/Referendum" id="w">referendum</a> on constitutional reform initiated by the Vaps Movement was approved by 72.7 percent.<sup id="_ref-EB_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EB" title="">[24]</a></sup> The league spearheaded replacement of the <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_system" id="w">parliamentary system</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Presidential_system" id="w">presidential form of government</a>  and laid the groundwork for an April 1934  presidential election, which it expected to win. However, the Vaps Movement was thwarted by a pre-emptive <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%26%2339%3B%C3%A9tat" id="w">coup d&#39;état</a> on <a href="/wiki/March_12" id="w">March 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1934" id="w">1934</a>, by <a href="/wiki/Head_of_State_of_Estonia" id="w">Head of State</a> <a href="/wiki/Konstantin_P%C3%A4ts" id="w">Konstantin Päts</a>, who then established his own authoritarian rule until new constitution came to force. During the <a href="/wiki/Era_of_Silence" id="w">Era of Silence</a> political parties were banned and the parliament was not in session between 1934 and 1938 as the country was <a href="/wiki/Rule_by_decree" id="w">ruled by decree</a> by <a href="/wiki/Konstantin_P%C3%A4ts" id="w">Konstantin Päts</a>. The Vaps Movement  was officially banned and finally disbanded in December 1935. On May 6 <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a>, 150 members of the league went on trial and 143 of them were convicted to long-term prison sentences. They were granted an amnesty and freed in <a href="/wiki/1938" id="w">1938</a>, by which time the league had lost most of its popular support.                 </p>
<p>The independence period was one of great cultural advancement.{{citation}} Estonian language schools were established, and artistic life of all kinds flourished. One of the more notable cultural acts of the independence period, unique in western Europe at the time of its passage in 1925, was a guarantee of cultural autonomy to <a href="/wiki/Minority_group" id="w">minority groups</a> comprising at least 3,000 persons, including <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jews</a> (see <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Estonia" id="w">history of the Jews in Estonia</a>).

<p>The Soviet authorities, having gained control over Estonia, immediately imposed a regime of terror. During the first year of Soviet occupation (1940-1941) over 8,000 people, including most of the country&#39;s leading politicians and military officers, were arrested. About 2,200 of the arrested were executed in Estonia, while most others were moved to prison camps in Russia, from where very few were later able to return alive. On <a href="/wiki/June_14" id="w">June 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, when mass <a href="/wiki/Deportation" id="w">deportations</a> took place simultaneously in all three Baltic countries, about 10,000 Estonian civilians were deported to <a href="/wiki/Siberia" id="w">Siberia</a> and other remote areas of the Soviet Union, where nearly half of them later perished. Of the 32,100 Estonian men who were forcibly relocated to Russia under the pretext of mobilisation into the Soviet army after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, nearly 40 percent died within the next year in the so-called &#34;<a href="/wiki/Labour_battalion" id="w">labour battalions</a>&#34; through hunger, cold and overworking. During the first Soviet occupation of 1940-41 about 500 Jews were deported to <a href="/wiki/Siberia" id="w">Siberia</a>
Estonian graveyards and monuments were destroyed. Among others, the <a href="/wiki/Tallinn_Military_Cemetery" id="w">Tallinn Military Cemetery</a> had the majority of gravestones from 1918–1944 destroyed by the Soviet authorities, and this graveyard became reused by the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a>.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup>

After <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Nazi Germany</a> invaded the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> on <a href="/wiki/June_22" id="w">June 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, and the Wehrmacht reached Estonia in July 1941, most Estonians greeted the Germans with relatively open arms and hoped to restore independence. But it soon became clear that sovereignty was out of the question. Estonia became a part of the German-occupied &#34;<a href="/wiki/Reichskommissariat_Ostland" id="w">Ostland</a>&#34;. A <a href="/wiki/Sicherheitspolizei" id="w">Sicherheitspolizei</a> was established for internal security under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/Ain-Ervin_Mere" id="w">Ain-Ervin Mere</a>. The initial enthusiasm that accompanied the liberation from Soviet occupation quickly waned as a result and the Germans had limited success in recruiting volunteers. The draft was introduced in 1942, resulting in some 3400 men fleeing to Finland to fight in the Finnish Army rather than join the Germans. <a href="/wiki/Finnish_Infantry_Regiment_200" id="w">Finnish Infantry Regiment 200</a> AKA (Estonian: <i>soomepoisid</i>) was formed out of Estonian volunteers in Finland. With the Allied victory over Germany becoming certain in 1944, the only option to save Estonia&#39;s independence was to stave off a new Soviet invasion of Estonia until Germany&#39;s capitulation. </p>
<p>By January 1944, the front was pushed back by the Soviet Army almost all the way to the former Estonian border. <a href="/wiki/Narva" id="w">Narva</a> was evacuated. <a href="/wiki/J%C3%BCri_Uluots" id="w">Jüri Uluots</a>, the last legitimate prime minister of the Republic of Estonia (according to the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia) prior to its fall to the Soviet Union in 1940, delivered a radio address that implored all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service (Before this, Uluots had opposed Estonian mobilization.) The call drew support from all across the country: 38.000 volunteers jammed registration centers. <sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Several thousand Estonians who had joined the Finnish army came back across the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Finland" id="w">Gulf of Finland</a> to join the newly formed  Territorial Defense Force, assigned to defend Estonia against the Soviet advance. It was hoped that by engaging in such a war Estonia would be able to attract Western support for the cause of Estonia&#39;s independence from the USSR and thus ultimately succeed in achieving independence. <sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup>
The initial formation of the volunteer SS Estonian <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Legion">legion</a> created in 1942 was eventually expanded to become a full-sized conscript division of the <a href="/wiki/Waffen_SS" id="w">Waffen SS</a> in 1944, the <a href="/wiki/20th_Waffen_Grenadier_Division_of_the_SS_(1st_Estonian)" id="w">20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)</a>. The Estonian units saw action defending the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Narva_(1944)" id="w">Narva line</a> throughout 1944. </p>
<p>As the Germans retreated in September 1944, <a href="/wiki/J%C3%BCri_Uluots" id="w">Jüri Uluots</a>, the last Prime Minister of the Estonian Republic prior to Soviet occupation, assumed the responsibilities of president (as dictated in the Constitution) and appointed a new government while seeking recognition from the <a href="/wiki/Allies" id="w">Allies</a>.  The new government fled to <a href="/wiki/Stockholm" id="w">Stockholm</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Sweden</a> and operated in exile until 1992, when <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Mark" id="w">Heinrich Mark</a>, the prime minister of the Estonian government in exile acting as president, presented his credentials to incoming president <a href="/wiki/Lennart_Meri" id="w">Lennart Meri</a>.</p>

<p><b>Historical background</b> {{main}}</p>
<p>The process of Jewish settlement in Estonia began in the nineteenth century, when in 1865 the Russian Tsar <a href="/wiki/Alexander_II" id="w">Alexander II</a> granted them the right to enter the region. The creation of the Republic of Estonia in 1918 marked the beginning of a new era for the Jews. Approximately 200 Jews fought in combat for the creation of the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Estonia" id="w">Republic of Estonia</a> and 70 of these men were volunteers. From the very first days of her existence as a state, Estonia showed her tolerance towards all the peoples inhabiting her territories. On 12 February 1925 The Estonian government passed a law pertaining to the cultural autonomy of minority peoples. The Jewish community quickly prepared its application for cultural autonomy. Statistics on Jewish citizens were compiled. They totaled 3,045, fulfilling the minimum requirement of 3000. In June 1926 the Jewish Cultural Council was elected and Jewish cultural autonomy was declared. Jewish cultural autonomy was of great interest to global Jewish community. The Jewish National Endowment presented the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_the_Republic_of_Estonia" id="w">Government of the Republic of Estonia</a> with a certificate of gratitude for this achievement.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>There were, at the time of Soviet occupation in 1940, approximately 2000 Estonian Jews. Many of Jewish people were deported to Siberia along with other Estonians by the Soviets. It is estimated that 500 Jews suffered this fate. With the invasion of the Baltics, it was the intention of the Nazi government to use the Baltics countries as their main area of mass genocide. Consequently, Jews from countries outside the Baltics were shipped there to be exterminated. Out the approximately 4,300 Jews in Estonia prior to the war, between 1,500 and 2,000 were entrapped by the Nazis. <sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> Estonia had suffered huge losses. Ports had been destroyed, and 45% of industry and 40% of the railways had become damaged.  Estonia&#39;s population had decreased by one-fifth, about 200,000 people. Some 10% of the population (over 80,000 people) had fled to the West between 1940 and 1944.  More than 30,000 soldiers had been killed in action. In 1944 Russian <a href="/wiki/Air_raid" id="w">air raids</a> had destroyed <a href="/wiki/Narva" id="w">Narva</a> and one-third of the residential area in <a href="/wiki/Tallinn" id="w">Tallinn</a>. By the late autumn of 1944, Soviet forces had ushered in a second phase of Soviet rule in heels of German troops withdrawing from Estonia, and followed it up by a new wave of arrests and executions of people considered disloyal to the Soviets.{{citation}}</p>
<p>An anti-Soviet <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare" id="w">guerrilla</a> movement known as the <a href="/wiki/Forest_Brothers" id="w">&#34;Metsavennad&#34; (&#34;Forest Brothers&#34;)</a> developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946-48. It is hard to tell how many people were in the ranks of the <i>Metsavennad</i>, however it is estimated on different times there could be about 30,000–35,000 people. Probably the last Forest Brother was caught in the September of 1978, and killed himself during his apprehension.</p>
<p>In March 1949, 20,722 people (2.5% of the population) were deported to Siberia. By the beginning of the 1950s, the occupying regime had suppressed the resistance movement.</p>
<p>After the war the Communist Party of the <a href="/wiki/Estonian_SSR" id="w">Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> (ECP) became the pre-eminent organization in the republic. The ethnic Estonian share in the total ECP membership decreased from 90% in 1941 to 48% in 1952.

After <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" id="w">Stalin</a>&#39;s death, Party membership vastly expanded its social base to include more ethnic Estonians. By the mid-1960s, the percentage of ethnic Estonian membership stabilized near 50%. On the eve of <a href="/wiki/Perestroika" id="w">perestroika</a> the ECP claimed about 100,000 members; less than half were ethnic Estonians and they totalled less than 2% of the country&#39;s population.</p>
<p>One positive aspect of the post-Stalin era in Estonia was the re-permission in the late 1950s of citizens&#39; contacts with foreign countries. Ties were reactivated with <a href="/wiki/Finland" id="w">Finland</a>, and in the 1960s, a ferry connection was opened from Tallinn to <a href="/wiki/Helsinki" id="w">Helsinki</a> and Estonians began watching Finnish television. This electronic &#34;window on the West&#34; afforded Estonians more information on current affairs and more access to Western culture and thought than any other group in the Soviet Union. This heightened media environment was important in preparing Estonians for their vanguard role in extending perestroika during the <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev" id="w">Gorbachev</a> era.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, Estonian society grew increasingly concerned about the threat of cultural Russification to the Estonian language and national identity. By 1981, Russian was taught in the first grade of Estonian language schools and was also introduced into the Estonian pre-school teaching.</p>
<p>By the beginning of the Gorbachev era, concern over the cultural survival of the Estonian people had reached a critical point. The ECP remained stable in the early perestroika years but waned in the late 1980s. Other political movements, groupings, and parties moved to fill the power vacuum. The first and most important was the <a href="/wiki/Estonian_Popular_Front" id="w">Estonian Popular Front</a>, established in April 1988 with its own platform, leadership, and broad constituency. The <a href="/wiki/Greens" id="w">Greens</a> and the dissident-led <a href="/wiki/Estonian_National_Independence_Party" id="w">Estonian National Independence Party</a> soon followed. By 1989, the political spectrum widened, and new parties were formed and re-formed almost daily.</p>
<p>The republic&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Soviet" id="w">Supreme Soviet</a> transformed into an authentic regional lawmaking body. This relatively conservative legislature passed an early declaration of sovereignty (<a href="/wiki/November_16" id="w">November 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1988" id="w">1988</a>); a law on economic independence (May 1989) confirmed by the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet that November; a language law making Estonian the <a href="/wiki/Official_language" id="w">official language</a> (January 1989); and local and republic election laws stipulating residency requirements for voting and candidacy (August, November 1989).</p>
<p>Although the majority of Estonia&#39;s large Russian-speaking diaspora of Soviet-era immigrants did not support full independence, they were divided in their goals for the republic. In March 1990 some 18% of <a href="/wiki/Russian_language" id="w">Russian</a> speakers supported the idea of a fully independent Estonia, up from 7% the previous autumn, and by early 1990 only a small minority of ethnic Estonians were opposed to full independence.</p>
<a id="Regaining_independence" name="Regaining_independence"></a><h1>Regaining independence</h1>

<p>Despite the emergence of the Popular Front and the Supreme Soviet as a new lawmaking body, since 1989 the different segments of the indigenous Estonian population had been politically mobilized by different and competing actors. The Popular Front&#39;s proposal, to declare the independence of Estonia as a new, so-called &#34;third republic&#34; whose citizens would be all those living there at the moment found less and less support over time. </p>
<p>A grassroots Estonian Citizens&#39; Committees Movement launched in 1989 with the objective of registering all pre-war citizens of the Republic of Estonia and their descendants in order to convene a <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Estonia" id="w">Congress of Estonia</a>. Their emphasis was on the illegal nature of the Soviet system and that hundreds of thousands inhabitants of Estonia had not ceased to be citizens of Estonian Republic which still existed <i>de jure</i>, recognized by the majority of Western nations. Despite the hostility of the mainstream official press and intimidation by Soviet Estonian authorities, dozens of local citizens&#39; committees were elected by popular initiative all over the country. These quickly organized into a nation-wide structure and by the beginning of 1990, over 900,000 people had registered themselves as citizens of the Republic of Estonia. </p>
<p>The spring of 1990 saw two free elections and two alternative legislatures developed in Estonia. On <a href="/wiki/24_February" id="w">24 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a>, the 464-member Congress of Estonia (including 35 delegates of refugee communities abroad) was elected by the registered citizens of the republic. The Congress of Estonia convened for the first time in Tallinn <a href="/wiki/March_11" id="w">March 11</a>–12, 1990, passing 14 declarations and resolutions. A 70-member standing committee (<a href="/wiki/Eesti_Komitee" id="w">Eesti Komitee</a>) was elected with <a href="/wiki/Tunne_Kelam" id="w">Tunne Kelam</a> as its chairman. </p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/March_18" id="w">March 18</a> <a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a> elections for the 105-member Supreme Soviet all residents of Estonia were eligible to participate, including all Soviet-era immigrants from the U.S.S.R. and approximately 50,000 Soviet troops stationed there. The Popular Front coalition, composed of <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" id="w">left</a> and <a href="/wiki/Centrism" id="w">centrist parties</a> and led by former <a href="/wiki/Central_Planning_Committee" id="w">Central Planning Committee</a> official <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Savisaar" id="w">Edgar Savisaar</a>, gained a parliamentary majority. In <a href="/wiki/May_8" id="w">May 8</a>, 1990, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia (created previous day) restored the Republic of <a href="/wiki/Estonia" id="w">Estonia</a>. </p>
<p>In March 1991 a referendum was held on the issue of independence. This was somewhat controversial, as holding a referendum could be taken as signalling that Estonian independence would be established rather than &#34;re&#34;-established. There was some discussion about whether it was appropriate to allow the Russian immigrant minority to vote, or if this decision should be reserved exclusively for citizens of Estonia. In the end all major political parties backed the referendum, considering it most important to send a strong signal to the world. To further legitimise the vote, all residents of Estonia were allowed to participate. The result vindicated these decisions, as the referendum produced a strong endorsement for independence. Turnout was 82%, and 64% of all possible voters in the country backed independence, with only 17% against. </p>
<p>Through a strict, non-confrontational policy in pursuing independence, Estonia managed to avoid the violence which <a href="/wiki/Latvia" id="w">Latvia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lithuania" id="w">Lithuania</a> incurred in the bloody January 1991 crackdowns and in the border customs-post guard murders that summer. During the <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1985-1991)#Yeltsin and the dissolution of the USSR" id="w">August coup</a> in the U.S.S.R., Estonia was able to maintain constant operation and control of its <a href="/wiki/Telecommunication" id="w">telecommunications</a> facilities, thereby offering the <a href="/wiki/Western_world" id="w">West</a> a clear view into the latest coup developments and serving as a conduit for swift Western support and recognition of Estonia&#39;s &#34;confirmation&#34; of independence on <a href="/wiki/August_20" id="w">August 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a>. <a href="/wiki/August_20" id="w">August 20</a> remains a national holiday in Estonia because of this.  Following Europe&#39;s lead, the United States formally reestablished diplomatic relations with Estonia on <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a>, and the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet offered recognition on <a href="/wiki/September_6" id="w">September 6</a>.</p>
<p>Since the debates of whether the future independent Estonia would be established as a new republic or a continuation of the first republic were not yet complete by the time of the August coup, but the members of the Supreme Soviet generally agreed that the independence should be declared rapidly, a compromise was hatched between the two main sides: instead of &#34;declaring&#34; independence, which would imply a new start, or explicitly asserting continuity, the declaration would &#34;confirm&#34; Estonia as a state independent of the Soviet Union, and willing to reestablish diplomatic relations on its own accord.  The full text of the statement is available at <a class="externallink" href="http://www.postimees.ee/080906/esileht/olulised_teemad/15_aastat/213898.php" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.postimees.ee/080906/esileht/olulised_teemad/15_aastat/213898.php">http://www.postimees.ee/080906/esileht/olulised_teemad/15_aastat/213898.php</a>.</p>
<p>After more than 3 years of negotiations, on <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a>, the armed forces of <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a> withdrew from Estonia.

<p>Since the last Russian troops left in <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a>, Estonia has been free to promote economic and political ties with Western Europe.
