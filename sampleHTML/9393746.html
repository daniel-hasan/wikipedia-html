<b>Hurricane Alberto</b> resulted in the worst flooding in western <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a> in over 32 years. The first tropical storm and <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane" id="w">hurricane</a> of the <a href="/wiki/1982_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1982 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Alberto developed from a tropical disturbance on <a href="/wiki/June_2" id="w">June 2</a> in the southern <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf of Mexico</a>. It rapidly organized and attained hurricane status the following day, the earliest date for a hurricane in the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> since <a href="/wiki/1970_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Hurricane Alma" id="w">Hurricane Alma</a> in <a href="/wiki/May" id="w">May</a> of <a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a>.{{hurdat}} Shortly after reaching peak winds off 85&#160;mph (140&#160;km/h), Alberto rapidly weakened due to approaching upper-level winds. Initial forecasts predicted the hurricane to continue northeastward into <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>; it turned sharply westward and drifted erratically for several days across the eastern Gulf of Mexico before dissipating on <a href="/wiki/June_6" id="w">June 6</a>.</p>
<p>Alberto produced heavy rainfall in western <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>, causing <a href="/wiki/Flash_flood" id="w">flash flooding</a> and severe damage. The storm damaged 8,745 houses and destroyed 154 buildings, leaving hundreds homeless. Heavy rainfall persisted in the country for several weeks after the storm, and damage from Alberto amounting to about $85&#160;million (1982&#160;USD, $178&#160;million 2006&#160;USD). At least 23&#160;people were killed in the country. Initially, Alberto was forecasted to continue northeastward and strike Florida, though its turn and rapid weakening resulted in minor effects in the state. </p>

In late <a href="/wiki/May" id="w">May</a>, a tropical disturbance gradually developed over the northwestern portion of the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a>. It drifted westward into the <a href="/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula" id="w">Yucatán Peninsula</a>, and on <a href="/wiki/June_1" id="w">June 1</a> the convection organized into a circular cloud pattern in association with a <a href="/wiki/Low_pressure_area" id="w">low pressure system</a>. The system tracked northeastward into the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf of Mexico</a> while continuing to organize, and subsequent to the formation of a low-level circulation it developed into Tropical Depression One while located about 40&#160;miles (65&#160;km) north-northwest of <a href="/wiki/Canc%C3%BAn" id="w">Cancún</a>. <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Hunters" id="w">Reconnaissance Aircraft</a> confirmed the existence of the tropical depression later that day.<sup id="_ref-mwr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mwr" title="">[1]</a></sup> Early on <a href="/wiki/June_3" id="w">June 3</a>, it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alberto while located about 150&#160;miles (240&#160;km) north-northwest of the western tip of <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>, based on a ship report of 45&#160;mph (75&#160;km/h) winds about 115&#160;miles (185&#160;km) south of its center.<sup id="_ref-tcr1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr1" title="">[2]</a></sup> An Air Force flight was scheduled into the storm, though was forbidden by the <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuban</a> government due to its presence in Cuban airspace.<sup id="_ref-aggravating_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aggravating" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Alberto quickly strengthened while moving northeastward through the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and intensified into a hurricane about nine hours after attaining tropical storm status. Late on <a href="/wiki/June_3" id="w">June 3</a>, Alberto attained peak winds of 85&#160;mph (140&#160;km/h) while located about 120&#160;miles (195&#160;km) west-southwest of <a href="/wiki/Key_West%2C_Florida" id="w">Key West, Florida</a>. Shortly after peaking in intensity, strong upper-level westerly winds impacted the deep convection of the storm. By early on <a href="/wiki/June_4" id="w">June 4</a> Alberto weakened to a tropical storm after turning sharply westward due to weak steering currents. It drifted erratically as the circulation became exposed, and early on <a href="/wiki/June_5" id="w">June 5</a> it degenerated into a convectiveless tropical depression. As a tropical depression, Alberto drifted to the east-northeast and later turned to the east, and late on <a href="/wiki/June_6" id="w">June 6</a> it dissipated while located about 70&#160;miles (115&#160;km) off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Preparations" name="Preparations"></a><h2>Preparations</h2>
<p>Due to its sudden development and project track into southwest <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> issued a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" id="w">tropical storm warning</a> and hours later a hurricane warning from the <a href="/wiki/Dry_Tortugas" id="w">Dry Tortugas</a> to <a href="/wiki/Marathon%2C_Florida" id="w">Marathon</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Keys" id="w">Florida Keys</a> and along the southwestern coastline northward to <a href="/wiki/Fort_Myers%2C_Florida" id="w">Fort Myers</a>. A hurricane watch was also issued from Marathon to <a href="/wiki/Jupiter%2C_Florida" id="w">Jupiter Inlet</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr1" title="">[2]</a></sup> At the time of the issuance of the hurricane warning, Alberto had been moving steadily northeastward; extrapolating its motion indicated a landfall on Key West within 12 hours and a mainland landfall at <a href="/wiki/Key_Largo%2C_Florida" id="w">Key Largo</a> within 24&#160;hours. Additionally, most <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_prediction_model" id="w">computer models</a> predicted Alberto to continue northeastward across south Florida. Only one model, not available until later, suggested a weakness in steering currents that would prevent a Florida landfall.<sup id="_ref-tcr2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr2" title="">[4]</a></sup> Officials ordered mandatory evacuations along the southwest coast of <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>. More than 1,000 left their homes to stay in nine emergency shelters.<sup id="_ref-wp605_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wp605" title="">[5]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Air_Florida" id="w">Air Florida</a> canceled all flights from <a href="/wiki/Miami%2C_Florida" id="w">Miami</a> to <a href="/wiki/Key_West%2C_Florida" id="w">Key West</a>. Many residents in the lower Florida Keys were unable to evacuate to the mainland, with about 50&#160;people in Key West evacuating to 4&#160;emergency shelters set up in the city. Officials closed schools in <a href="/wiki/Monroe_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Monroe County</a> at midday on <a href="/wiki/June_3" id="w">June 3</a> and also sent all nonessential city and county employees home.<sup id="_ref-api603_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-api603" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
