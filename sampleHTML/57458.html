<p><b>Rabies</b> ({{lang-la}}, &#34;madness, rage, fury&#34;) is a <a href="/wiki/Virus_(biology)" id="w">viral</a> <a href="/wiki/Zoonotic" id="w">zoonotic</a> disease that causes acute <a href="/wiki/Encephalitis" id="w">encephalitis</a> (inflammation of the brain) in <a href="/wiki/Mammal" id="w">mammals</a>. In non-vaccinated humans, rabies is almost invariably fatal after <a href="/wiki/Neurological" id="w">neurological</a> symptoms have developed, but prompt post-exposure <a href="/wiki/Vaccination" id="w">vaccination</a> may prevent the virus from progressing. There are only six known cases of a person surviving symptomatic rabies, and only one known <a href="/wiki/#Induced coma treatment" id="w">case</a>  of survival in which the patient received no rabies-specific treatment either before or after illness onset.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="Structure" name="Structure"></a><h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The virus is a <i><a href="/wiki/Lyssavirus" id="w">Lyssavirus</a></i>. This <a href="/wiki/Genus" id="w">genus</a> of <a href="/wiki/RNA_virus" id="w">RNA viruses</a> also includes the <a href="/wiki/Aravan_virus" id="w">Aravan virus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australian_bat_lyssavirus" id="w">Australian bat lyssavirus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Duvenhage_virus" id="w">Duvenhage virus</a>, <a href="/wiki/European_bat_lyssavirus_1" id="w">European bat lyssavirus 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/European_bat_lyssavirus_2" id="w">European bat lyssavirus 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/Irkut_virus" id="w">Irkut virus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Khujand_virus" id="w">Khujand virus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lagos_bat_virus" id="w">Lagos bat virus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mokola_virus" id="w">Mokola virus</a> and <a href="/wiki/West_Caucasian_bat_virus" id="w">West Caucasian bat virus</a>. Lyssaviruses have <a href="/wiki/Helical" id="w">helical</a> symmetry, so their infectious particles are approximately cylindrical in shape. This is typical of plant-infecting viruses; human-infecting viruses more commonly have cubic symmetry and take shapes approximating <a href="/wiki/Regular_polyhedron" id="w">regular polyhedra</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/Negri_bodies" id="w">Negri bodies</a></i> in the infected neurons are <a href="/wiki/Pathognomonic" id="w">pathognomonic</a>.</p>
<p>The virus has a bullet-like shape with a length of about <a href="/wiki/1_E-7_m" id="w">180 nm</a> and a cross-sectional diameter of about <a href="/wiki/1_E-8_m" id="w">75 nm</a>. One end is rounded or conical and the other end is planar or concave. The <a href="/wiki/Lipoprotein" id="w">lipoprotein</a> envelope carries knob-like spikes composed of <a href="/wiki/Glycoprotein" id="w">Glycoprotein</a> G. Spikes do not cover the planar end of the virion (virus particle). Beneath the envelope is the membrane or matrix (M) protein layer which may be <a href="/wiki/Invaginated" id="w">invaginated</a> at the planar end. The core of the virion consists of helically arranged <a href="/wiki/Ribonucleoprotein" id="w">ribonucleoprotein</a>.

<a id="Differential_diagnosis" name="Differential_diagnosis"></a><h2>Differential diagnosis</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Differential_diagnosis" id="w">differential diagnosis</a> in a case of suspected human rabies may initially include any cause of encephalitis,
particularly infection with viruses such as <a href="/wiki/Herpesviridae" id="w">herpesviruses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Enteroviruses" id="w">enteroviruses</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Arboviruses" id="w">arboviruses</a> (e.g., <a href="/wiki/West_Nile_virus" id="w">West Nile virus</a>). The most important viruses to rule out are <a href="/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus" id="w">herpes simplex virus</a> type 1, <a href="/wiki/Varicella-zoster_virus" id="w">varicella-zoster virus</a>, and (less commonly) enteroviruses, including <a href="/wiki/Coxsackie_virus" id="w">coxsackieviruses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Echovirus" id="w">echoviruses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poliovirus" id="w">polioviruses</a>, and human <a href="/wiki/Enterovirus" id="w">enteroviruses</a> 68 to 71. A specific diagnosis may be made by a variety of diagnostic techniques, including <a href="/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction" id="w">polymerase chain reaction</a> (PCR) testing of <a href="/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid" id="w">cerebrospinal fluid</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cell_culture#Viral culture methods" id="w">viral culture</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Serology" id="w">serology</a>. In addition, consideration should be given to the local <a href="/wiki/Epidemiology" id="w">epidemiology</a> of encephalitis caused by arboviruses belonging to several <a href="/wiki/Taxonomy" id="w">taxonomic</a> groups, including eastern and western <a href="/wiki/Equine_encephalitis" id="w">equine encephalitis viruses</a>, <a href="/wiki/St._Louis_encephalitis" id="w">St. Louis encephalitis</a> virus, <a href="/wiki/Powassan_virus" id="w">Powassan virus</a>, the <a href="/wiki/California_encephalitis_virus" id="w">California encephalitis virus</a> serogroup, and <a href="/wiki/La_Crosse_virus" id="w">La Crosse virus</a>. </p>
<p>New causes of viral encephalitis are also possible, as was evidenced by the recent outbreak in Malaysia of some 300 cases of encephalitis (mortality rate, 40%) caused by <a href="/wiki/Nipah_virus" id="w">Nipah virus</a>, a newly recognized <a href="/wiki/Paramyxovirus" id="w">paramyxovirus</a>.{{Fact}} Similarly, well-known viruses may be introduced into new locations, as is illustrated by the recent outbreak of encephalitis due to West Nile virus in the eastern United States.{{Fact}} Epidemiologic factors (e.g., season, geographic location, and the patient’s age, travel history, and possible exposure to animal bites, rodents, and ticks) may help direct the diagnostic workup.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Micrograph with numerous rabies <a href="/wiki/Virion" id="w">virions</a> (small dark-grey rod-like particles) and Negri bodies, larger pathognomonic cellular inclusions of rabies infection</div></div>
 Any mammal may become infected with the rabies virus and develop symptoms, including humans. Most animals can be infected by the virus and can transmit the disease to humans. Infected bats, monkeys, raccoons, foxes, skunks, cattle, wolves, dogs or cats provide the greatest risk to humans. Rabies may also spread through exposure to infected domestic farm animals, groundhogs, weasels and other wild carnivores. Squirrels, rodents and rabbits are seldom infected.</p>
<p>The virus is usually present in the nerves and <a href="/wiki/Saliva" id="w">saliva</a> of a symptomatic rabid animal.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The route of <a href="/wiki/Infection" id="w">infection</a> is usually, but not necessarily, by a bite. In many cases the affected animal is exceptionally aggressive, may attack without provocation, and exhibits otherwise uncharacteristic behaviour<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nda.agric.za/docs/rabies/rabies.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nda.agric.za/docs/rabies/rabies.htm">http://www.nda.agric.za/docs/rabies/rabies.htm</a>. Transmission may also occur via an <a href="/wiki/Particulate" id="w">aerosol</a> through <a href="/wiki/Mucous_membrane" id="w">mucous membranes</a>; transmission in this form may have happened in people exploring caves populated by rabid bats. Transmission between humans is extremely rare, although it can happen through <a href="/wiki/Organ_transplant" id="w">transplant surgery</a> (see below for recent cases), or, even more rarely, through bites or kisses.</p>
<p>After a typical human infection by bite, the virus directly or indirectly enters the <a href="/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system" id="w">peripheral nervous system</a>. It then travels along the <a href="/wiki/Nerve" id="w">nerves</a> towards the <a href="/wiki/Central_nervous_system" id="w">central nervous system</a>. During this phase, the virus cannot be easily detected within the host, and vaccination may still confer cell-mediated immunity to prevent symptomatic rabies. Once the virus reaches the <a href="/wiki/Brain" id="w">brain</a>, it rapidly causes encephalitis and symptoms appear. It may also inflame the <a href="/wiki/Spinal_cord" id="w">spinal cord</a> producing <a href="/wiki/Myelitis" id="w">myelitis</a>.</p>
<p>The period between infection and the first <a href="/wiki/Flu" id="w">flu</a>-like symptoms is normally two to twelve weeks, but can be as long as two years. Soon after, the symptoms expand to slight or partial <a href="/wiki/Paralysis" id="w">paralysis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cerebral_dysfunction" id="w">cerebral dysfunction</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anxiety" id="w">anxiety</a>, <a href="/wiki/Insomnia" id="w">insomnia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Confusion" id="w">confusion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Agitation_(emotion)" id="w">agitation</a>, abnormal behavior, <a href="/wiki/Paranoia" id="w">paranoia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hallucination" id="w">hallucinations</a>, progressing to <a href="/wiki/Delirium" id="w">delirium</a>. The production of large quantities of saliva and tears coupled with an inability to speak or swallow are typical during the later stages of the disease; this can result in &#34;hydrophobia&#34;, where the victim has difficulty swallowing, shows panic when presented with liquids to drink, and cannot quench his or her thirst. The disease itself was also once commonly known as <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hydrophobia">hydrophobia</a></i>, from these characteristic symptoms. Death almost invariably results two to ten days after the first symptoms; the few humans who are known to have survived the disease were all left with severe <a href="/wiki/Brain_damage" id="w">brain damage</a>, with the recent exception of <a href="/wiki/Jeanna_Giese" id="w">Jeanna Giese</a> (see below).  It is neurotrophic in nature.</p>
<a id="Prevention" name="Prevention"></a><h2> Prevention </h2>
<p>Rabies can be prevented by vaccination, both in humans and other animals. Virtually every infection with rabies was a death sentence, until <a href="/wiki/Louis_Pasteur" id="w">Louis Pasteur</a> and <a href="/wiki/Emile_Roux" id="w">Emile Roux</a> developed the first rabies vaccination in <a href="/wiki/1885" id="w">1885</a>. This vaccine was first used on a human on <a href="/wiki/July_6" id="w">July 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1885" id="w">1885</a> &#8211; nine-year old boy <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Meister" id="w">Joseph Meister</a> (1876–1940) had been mauled by a rabid dog.<a class="externallink" href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0093-0334(197804)8%3A2%3C26%3APWORRT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J" rel="nofollow" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0093-0334(197804)8%3A2%3C26%3APWORRT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J">http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0093-0334(197804)8%3A2%3C26%3APWORRT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.zephyrus.co.uk/louispasteur.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.zephyrus.co.uk/louispasteur.html">http://www.zephyrus.co.uk/louispasteur.html</a></p>
<p>Their vaccine consisted of a sample of the virus harvested from infected (and necessarily dead) rabbits, which was weakened by allowing it to dry for 5 to 10 days. Similar nerve tissue-derived vaccines are still used now in some countries, and while they are much cheaper than modern cell culture vaccines, they are not as effective and carry a certain risk of neurological complications.</p>
<p>The human <a href="/wiki/Diploid" id="w">diploid</a> cell rabies vaccine (H.D.C.V.) was started in 1967. Human diploid cell rabies vaccines are made using the attenuated Pitman-Moore L503 strain of the virus. Human diploid cell rabies vaccines have been given to more than 1.5 million humans <a href="/wiki/As_of_2006" id="w">as of 2006</a>. Newer and less expensive purified chicken embryo cell vaccine, and purified <a href="/wiki/Vero_cell" id="w">Vero cell</a> rabies vaccine are now available. The purified Vero cell rabies vaccine uses the attenuated Wistar strain of the rabies virus, and uses the Vero cell line as its host.</p>
<p>Some recent works have shown that during lethal rabies infection the blood-brain barrier (BBB) does not allow anti-viral immune cells to enter the brain, the primary site of rabies virus replication.<sup id="_ref-Roy_2007a_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Roy_2007a" title="">[4]</a></sup> This aspect contributes to the pathogenicity of the virus and artificially increasing BBB permeability promotes viral clearance.<sup id="_ref-Roy_2007b_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Roy_2007b" title="">[5]</a></sup> Opening the BBB during rabies infection has been suggested as a possible novel approach to treat the disease.</p>
<a id="Post-exposure_prophylaxis" name="Post-exposure_prophylaxis"></a><h3>Post-exposure prophylaxis</h3>
<p>Treatment after exposure, known as <a href="/wiki/Post-exposure_prophylaxis" id="w">post-exposure prophylaxis</a> or &#34;P.E.P.&#34;, is highly successful in preventing the disease if administered promptly, within fourteen days after infection. The first step is immediately washing the wound with soap and water, which is very effective at reducing the number of viral particles. In the United States, patients receive one dose of <a href="/wiki/Immunoglobulin" id="w">immunoglobulin</a> and five doses of rabies vaccine over a twenty-eight day period. One-half the dose of immunoglobulin is injected in the region of the bite, if possible, with the remainder injected <a href="/wiki/Intramuscular_injection" id="w">intramuscularly</a> away from the bite. This is much less painful compared with administering immunoglobulin through the <a href="/wiki/Abdominal_wall" id="w">abdominal wall</a> with a large needle, which is how it was done in the past. The first dose of rabies vaccine is given as soon as possible after exposure, with additional doses on days three, seven, fourteen, and twenty-eight after the first. Patients that have previously received pre-exposure vaccination do not receive the immunoglobulin, only the post-exposure vaccinations. Since the widespread vaccination of domestic dogs and cats and the development of effective human vaccines and immunoglobulin treatments, the number of recorded deaths in the U.S. from rabies has dropped from one hundred or more annually in the early twentieth century, to 1&#8211;2 per year, mostly caused by bat bites, which may go unnoticed by the victim and hence untreated.</p>
<p>P.E.P. is effective in treating rabies because the virus must travel from the site of infection through the peripheral nervous system (nerves in the body) before infecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and glands to cause lethal damage. This travel along the nerves is usually slow enough that vaccine and immunoglobulin can be administered to protect the brain and glands from infection. The amount of time this travel requires is dependent on how far the infected area is from the brain: if the victim is bitten in the face, for example, the time between initial infection and infection of the brain is very short and P.E.P. may not be successful.</p>
<a id="Pre-exposure_prophylaxis" name="Pre-exposure_prophylaxis"></a><h3>Pre-exposure prophylaxis</h3>
<p>Currently pre-exposure <a href="/wiki/Immunization" id="w">immunization</a> has been used on domesticated and normal non-human populations. In many jurisdictions, domestic dogs, cats, and ferrets are required to be vaccinated. A pre-exposure vaccination is also available for humans, most commonly given to veterinarians and those traveling to regions where the disease is common, such as India. Most tourists do not need such a vaccination, just those doing substantial non-urban activities. However, should a vaccinated human be bitten by a carrier, failure to receive subsequent post-exposure treatment could be fatal, although post-exposure treatment for a vaccinated human is far less extensive than that which would normally be required by one with no pre-exposure vaccination.</p>
<p>In 1984 researchers at the <a href="/wiki/Wistar_Institute" id="w">Wistar Institute</a> developed a <a href="/wiki/Recombinant" id="w">recombinant</a> vaccine called V-RG by inserting the <a href="/wiki/Glycoprotein" id="w">glycoprotein</a> gene from rabies into a <a href="/wiki/Vaccinia" id="w">vaccinia</a> virus.<sup id="_ref-Wiktor_1984_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wiktor_1984" title="">[6]</a></sup> The V-RG vaccine has since been commercialised by <a href="/wiki/Merial" id="w">Merial</a> under the trademark <a class="externallink" href="http://www.raboral.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.raboral.com/">Raboral</a>. It is harmless to humans and has been shown to be safe for various species of animals that might accidentally encounter it in the wild, including birds (gulls, hawks, and owls).<sup id="_ref-Artois_1990_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Artois_1990" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>V-RG has been successfully used in the field in <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> to prevent outbreaks of rabies in <a href="/wiki/Wildlife" id="w">wildlife</a>. The virus is stable under relatively high temperatures and can be delivered orally, making mass vaccination of wildlife possible by putting it in tasty baits. The plan for immunization of normal populations involves dropping bait containing food wrapped around a small dose of the live virus. The bait would be dropped by helicopter concentrating on areas that have not been infected yet. Just such a strategy of oral immunization of foxes in Europe has already achieved substantial reductions in the incidence of human rabies. A strategy of vaccinating &#34;neighborhood dogs&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Jaipur" id="w">Jaipur</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>, (combined with a sterilization program) has also resulted in a large reduction in the number of human cases.<sup id="_ref-Reece_2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reece_2006" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Induced_coma_treatment" name="Induced_coma_treatment"></a><h2>Induced coma treatment</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>In 2005, the case of Jeanna Giese, a girl of 15 who survived acute, unvaccinated rabies was reported, indicating the successful treatment of rabies through <a href="/wiki/Induced_coma" id="w">induction of a coma</a>.<sup id="_ref-Willoughby_2005_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Willoughby_2005" title="">[9]</a></sup> This treatment approach was based on the theory that rabies&#39; detrimental effects were caused by temporary dysfunctions of the brain, and that the induction of a coma, by producing a temporary partial stop in brain function, would protect the brain from damage while the body built up an immune response to the virus. After thirty-one days of isolation and seventy-six days of hospitalisation, she was released from the hospital, having survived rabies. Later attempts to use the same treatment have failed.</p>
<p>The primary care physician in this case published in the April 2007 issue of <i>Scientific American</i>.<sup id="_ref-SciAmApr07_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SciAmApr07" title="">[10]</a></sup> He notes that subsequent failures of what he calls the <i>Milwaukee protocol</i> did not use the cocktail of drugs used during the treatment. A point he makes for future research is the relationship of the virus to depletion of <a href="/wiki/Biopterin" id="w">biopterin</a> in the brain.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/English_Channel" id="w">English Channel</a>, dog licensing, killing of stray dogs, muzzling and other measures contributed to the eradication of rabies from the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> in the early <a href="/wiki/20th_century" id="w">20th century</a>. More recently, large-scale vaccination of cats, dogs and ferrets has been successful in combatting rabies in some developed countries.</p>
<p>The rabies virus survives in wide-spread, varied, rural fauna reservoirs. However, in Asia, parts of America and large parts of Africa, dogs remain the principal host. Mandatory vaccination of animals is less effective in rural areas. Especially in developing countries, pets may not be privately kept and their destruction may be unacceptable. Oral vaccines can be safely distributed in baits, and this has successfully reduced rabies in rural areas of France, <a href="/wiki/Ontario" id="w">Ontario</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a> and elsewhere. Vaccination campaigns may be expensive, and a cost-benefit analysis can lead those responsible to opt for policies of containment rather than elimination of the disease.</p>
<p>Many territories, such as the United Kingdom, <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" id="w">Taiwan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" id="w">Hawaii</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mauritius" id="w">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/wiki/Barbados" id="w">Barbados</a> and <a href="/wiki/Guam" id="w">Guam</a>, are free of rabies, although there may be a very low prevalence of rabies among bats in the UK; see below.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a> and <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> have never had rabies.<a class="externallink" href="http://epix.hazard.net/topics/animal/rabies.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://epix.hazard.net/topics/animal/rabies.htm">http://epix.hazard.net/topics/animal/rabies.htm</a> However, in Australia, the Australian Bat Lyssavirus occurs normally in both insectivorous and fruit eating bats (flying foxes) from most mainland states. Scientists believe it is present in bat populations throughout the range of flying foxes in Australia.</p>
<p>The UK is not completely free of rabies, as a new form of the lyssavirus has been found in some bats which could possibly affect humans. There has been one case of a bite from an infected bat, but the victim showed no symtoms of the virus and was vaccinated quickly as a precaution.</p>

 The particular variant of the virus has been identified in the southeastern United States raccoon population since the <a href="/wiki/1950s" id="w">1950s</a>, and is believed to have traveled to the northeast as the result of infected raccoons being among those caught and transported from the southeast to the northeast by human hunters attempting to replenish the declining northeast raccoon population.<sup id="_ref-Nettles_1979_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nettles_1979" title="">[14]</a></sup> As a result, urban residents of these areas have become more wary of the large but normally unseen urban raccoon population. It has become the common assumption that any raccoon seen <a href="/wiki/Diurnal_animal" id="w">diurnally</a> is infected; certainly the reported behavior of most such animals appears to show some sort of illness, and <a href="/wiki/Autopsy" id="w">necropsies</a> can confirm rabies. Whether as a result of increased vigilance or only the common human avoidance reaction to any other animal not normally seen, such as a raccoon, there has only been one documented human rabies case as a result of this variant.<sup id="_ref-MMWR_2003_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MMWR_2003" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Humane_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Humane" title="">[16]</a></sup> This does not include, however, the greatly increasing rate of prophylactic rabies treatments in cases of possible exposure, which numbered fewer than one hundred humans annually in the state of <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a> before <a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a>, for instance, but rose to approximately ten thousand annually between <a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a> and <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a>. At approximately $1,500 per course of treatment, this represents a considerable public health expenditure.

In the midwestern United States, <a href="/wiki/Skunk" id="w">skunks</a> are the primary carriers of rabies, composing 134 of the 237 documented non-human cases in <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a>. The most widely distributed reservoir of rabies in the United States, however, and the source of most human cases in the U.S., are <a href="/wiki/Bat" id="w">bats</a>. Nineteen of the twenty-two human rabies cases documented in the United States between <a href="/wiki/1980" id="w">1980</a> and <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a> have been identified genetically as bat rabies. In many cases, victims are not even aware of having been bitten by a bat, assuming that a small puncture wound found after the fact was the bite of an <a href="/wiki/Insect" id="w">insect</a> or <a href="/wiki/Spider" id="w">spider</a>; in some cases, no wound at all can be found, leading to the hypothesis that in some cases the virus can be contracted via inhaling airborne aerosols from the vicinity of bats. For instance, the <a href="/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention" id="w">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> warned on <a href="/wiki/May_9" id="w">May 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>, that a woman who died in October, <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cumberland_County%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Cumberland County, Kentucky</a> and a man who died in December, <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a> in <a href="/wiki/Missoula_County%2C_Montana" id="w">Missoula County, Montana</a> were both infected with a rabies strain found in silver-haired bats; although bats were found living in the chimney of the woman&#39;s home and near the man&#39;s place of employment, neither victim could remember having had any contact with them.<sup id="_ref-cdc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cdc" title="">[18]</a></sup> Similar reports among <a href="/wiki/Spelunker" id="w">spelunkers</a> led to experimental demonstration in animals.<sup id="_ref-cons_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cons" title="">[19]</a></sup> This inability to recognize a potential infection, in contrast to a bite from a dog or raccoon, leads to a lack of proper prophylactic treatment, and is the cause of the high mortality rate for bat bites.</p>
<p>On September 7, 2007, rabies expert Dr. Charles Rupprecht of <a href="/wiki/Atlanta" id="w">Atlanta</a>-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that <a href="/wiki/Canidae" id="w">canine</a> rabies had disappeared from the United States. Rupprecht emphasized that the disappearance of the canine-specific strain of rabies virus in the US does not eliminate the need for dog rabies vaccination as dogs can still become infected from exposure to wildlife<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Infections by <a href="/wiki/Cornea" id="w">corneal</a> transplant have been reported in Thailand (2 cases), India (2 cases), Iran (2 cases),<sup id="_ref-Javadi_1996_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Javadi_1996" title="">[21]</a></sup> the United States (1 case), and France (1 case).<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> Details of two further cases of infection resulting from corneal transplants were described in 1996. </p>
<p>In June <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, three organ recipients died in the United States from rabies transmitted in the transplanted kidneys and liver of an infected donor from <a href="/wiki/Texarkana" id="w">Texarkana</a>.<sup id="_ref-MMWR_2004a_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MMWR_2004a" title="">[23]</a></sup> There were bats near the donor&#39;s home, and the donor had told others that he had been bitten.<sup id="_ref-MMWR_2004b_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MMWR_2004b" title="">[24]</a></sup> The donor is now reported to have died of a cerebral hemorrhage, the culmination of an unidentified neurological disorder, although recipients are said to have been told the cause of death had been a car crash. Marijuana and cocaine were found in the donor&#39;s urine at the time of his death, according to a report in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>.<sup id="_ref-Srinivasan_2005_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Srinivasan_2005" title="">[25]</a></sup></p><blockquote>&#34;[The surgeons] thought he had suffered a fatal crack-cocaine overdose, which can produce symptoms similar to those of rabies. &#39;We had an explanation for his condition,&#39; says Dr. Goran Klintmalm, a surgeon who oversees transplantation at Baylor University Medical Center, where the transplants occurred. &#39;He&#39;d recently smoked crack cocaine. He&#39;d hemorrhaged around the brain. He&#39;d died. That was all we needed to know&#39;. Because of doctor-patient confidentiality rules, doctors involved with this case would not talk about it on the record, but a few did say that if no cocaine was found in the donor&#39;s blood, the E.R. doctors might have investigated his symptoms more aggressively instead of assuming he had overdosed. (Because no autopsy was done, doctors have not been able to establish whether the rabies or the drugs actually killed him.)&#34;<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>In February <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, three <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> patients in <a href="/wiki/Mainz" id="w">Mainz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heidelberg" id="w">Heidelberg</a> were diagnosed with rabies after receiving various organs and cornea transplants from a female donor. Two of the infected people died. Three other patients who received organs from the woman have not yet shown rabies symptoms. The 26 year old donor had died of heart failure in December 2004 after consuming <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" id="w">cocaine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ecstasy_(drug)" id="w">ecstasy</a>. In October 2004, she had visited India, one of the countries worst affected by rabies worldwide. Dozens of medical staff were vaccinated against rabies in the two hospitals as a precautionary measure. Associated Press reports that &#34;Donated organs are never tested for rabies. The strain detected in the victims&#39; bodies is one commonly found in bats, health officials said.&#34; According to CNN &#34;Rabies tests are not routine donor screening tests, Virginia McBride, public health organ donation specialist with the Health Resources and Services Administration, said. The number of tests is limited because doctors have only about six hours from the time a patient is declared brain-dead until the transplantation must begin for the organs to maintain viability.&#34;</p>

Rabies is <a href="/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)" id="w">endemic</a> to many parts of the world, and one of the reasons given for <a href="/wiki/Quarantine" id="w">quarantine</a> periods in international animal transport has been to try to keep the disease out of uninfected regions. However, most developed countries, pioneered by <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Sweden</a>, now allow unencumbered travel between their territories for pet animals that have demonstrated an adequate immune response to rabies vaccination.</p>
<p>Such countries may limit movement to animals from countries where rabies is considered to be under control in pet animals. There are various <a href="/wiki/Lists_of_countries_where_rabies_in_pet_animals_is_under_control" id="w">lists of such countries</a>. The United Kingdom has developed a list, and France has a rather different list, said to be based on a list of the <i>Office International des Epizooties</i> (OIE). The European Union has a harmonised list. No list of rabies-free countries is readily available from OIE.</p>
<p>However, the recent spread of rabies in the northeastern United States and further may cause a restrengthening of precautions against movement of possibly rabid animals between countries.</p>

Rabies has a long history of association with dogs.  The first written record of rabies is in the Codex of <a href="/wiki/Eshnunna" id="w">Eshnunna</a> (ca. <a href="/wiki/20th_century_BC" id="w">1930 BC</a>) (written prior to the <a href="/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi" id="w">Code of Hammurabi</a>), which dictates that the owner of a dog showing symptoms of rabies should take preventative measure against bites.  If a person is bitten by a rabid dog and later died, the owner was fined heavily.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Three stages of rabies are recognized in dogs.  The first stage is a one to three day period characterized by behavioral changes and is known as the <a href="/wiki/Prodrome" id="w">prodromal stage</a>.  The second stage is the excitative stage, which lasts three to four days.  It is this stage that is often known as <i>furious rabies</i> due to the tendency of the affected dog to be hyperreactive to external stimuli and bite at anything near.  The third stage is the paralytic stage and is caused by damage to <a href="/wiki/Motor_neuron" id="w">motor neurons</a>.  Incoordination is seen due to rear limb paralysis and drooling and difficulty swallowing is caused by paralysis of facial and throat muscles.  Death is usually caused by <a href="/wiki/Respiratory_arrest" id="w">respiratory arrest</a>.<sup id="_ref-Ettinger_1995_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ettinger_1995" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

<p>Experimental studies of rabies infection in the Virginia opossum have shown the importance of the mode of transmission. Opossums became infected when exposed to air-borne virus but were found to be fairly resistant to intramuscular inoculations <sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup>.The aerosol transmission of rabies in opossum was investigated following the death from rabies of two men who had visited the Frio Caves, Texas, and did not remember any direct contact with bats.</p>

<p>Rabies cases in the Virginia opossum are spillover cases from other wildlife species such as bats,skunks and the raccoon epizootic in the eastern United States. 
Cases have been reported across the United States from California to New York <sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup>.

<a id="Rabies_and_domestic_skunks_in_the_United__States" name="Rabies_and_domestic_skunks_in_the_United__States"></a><h2>Rabies and domestic skunks in the United  States</h2>
<p>There is currently no <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" id="w">USDA</a>-approved vaccine for the strain of rabies that afflicts skunks. When cases are reported of <a href="/wiki/Pet_skunk" id="w">pet skunks</a> biting a human, the animals are frequently killed in order to be <a href="/wiki/Rabies_testing" id="w">tested for rabies</a>.</p>
<p>Humans exposed to the rabies virus must begin post-exposure prophylaxis before the disease can progress to the central nervous system. For this reason, it is necessary to determine whether the animal, in fact, has rabies as quickly as possible. Without a definitive quarantine period in place for skunks, quarantining the animals is not advised as there is no way of knowing how long it may take the animal to show symptoms. Destruction of the skunk is recommended and the brain is then tested for presence of rabies virus.</p>
<p>Skunk owners have recently organized to campaign for USDA approval of both a vaccine and an officially recommended quarantine period for skunks in the United States.</p>
<a id="Rabies_and_bats" name="Rabies_and_bats"></a><h2>Rabies and bats</h2>
<p>The problem of bat-transmitted rabies is found over most of North and South America but was first closely studied in <a href="/wiki/Trinidad" id="w">Trinidad</a> in the <a href="/wiki/West_Indies" id="w">West Indies</a> which had a dreadful reputation for bat rabies, which took a significant toll of livestock and humans alike. In the 10 years from 1925 and 1935, 89 people and thousands of livestock had died from it - &#34;the highest human mortality from rabies-infected bats thus far recorded anywhere.&#34;.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In early 1931, Dr. H. Metivier, a Veterinary surgeon, established the connection between the bites of bats and paralytic rabies. In September 1931, Dr. J. L. Pawan, a Government Bacteriologist found Negri bodies in the brain of a bat with unusual habits. In 1934 the Trinidad and Tobago Government began a program of vampire bat control, shooting, netting, trapping and poisoning, while encouraging the screening off of livestock buildings and free vaccination programs for exposed livestock. </p>
<p>After the opening of the <a href="/wiki/Trinidad_Regional_Virus_Laboratory" id="w">Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory</a> in 1953, basic research on bats and rabies progressed rapidly under the able direction of Arthur Greenhall, who demonstrated that at least 8 species of bats in Trinidad had been infected with rabies - particularly the <a href="/wiki/Common_Vampire_Bat" id="w">Common Vampire Bat</a>, <i>Desmodus rotundus</i> (which &#34;will attack any warm blooded creature&#34;), the rare <a href="/wiki/White-winged_Vampire_Bat" id="w">White-winged Vampire Bat</a>, <i>Diaemus youngi</i>, (which &#34;appears to have a special preference for birds and goats&#34;), as well as two abundant species of Fruit Bats: the <a href="/wiki/Seba%26%2339%3Bs_Short-tailed_Bat" id="w">Seba&#39;s Short-tailed Bat</a> or Short-tailed Fruit Bat, <i>Carollia perspicillata</i>, which commonly roosts with Vampires, and the <a href="/wiki/Jamaican_Fruit_Bat" id="w">Jamaican Fruit Bat</a>, <i>Artibeus jamaicensis</i>.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Non-bite transmission of rabies in people has been reported by the CDC<sup id="_ref-cdc_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cdc" title="">[18]</a></sup>, and experimentally demonstrated with a high efficiency in susceptible animals placed in bat-proof and insect-proof cages in a cave with bat colonies by Constantine in Frio Cave, Texas, as early as 1960.<sup id="_ref-cons_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cons" title="">[19]</a></sup> In 1967, rabies virus was isolated from the air in the same cave,<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> presumably passed by the bats urinating, potentially forming a source for infection of other susceptible animals, and presenting a hazard to researchers and spelunkers.

<p>The United Kingdom, which has stringent regulations on the importation of animals, had also been believed to be entirely free from rabies until <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a> when a single <a href="/wiki/Daubenton%26%2339%3Bs_bat" id="w">Daubenton&#39;s bat</a> was found to be infected with a rabies-like virus usually found only in bats &#8211; European Bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBL2).

Giese&#39;s disease was already too far progressed for the vaccine to help, and she was considered too weak to tolerate it. Doctors at the Children&#39;s Hospital of Wisconsin in <a href="/wiki/Wauwatosa%2C_Wisconsin" id="w">Wauwatosa</a>, a suburb of <a href="/wiki/Milwaukee%2C_Wisconsin" id="w">Milwaukee</a>, achieved her survival with an experimental treatment that involved putting the girl into a drug-induced <a href="/wiki/Coma" id="w">coma</a>, and administering a cocktail of <a href="/wiki/Antiviral_drug" id="w">antiviral drugs</a>.
