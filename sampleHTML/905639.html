He built a successful military career during the <a href="/wiki/Interwar_period" id="w">interwar period</a> but is most noted for his involvement in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, when he commanded the forces of the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">British Commonwealth</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Malaya" id="w">Battle of Malaya</a> and the subsequent <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore" id="w">Battle of Singapore</a>.</p>
<p>Percival&#39;s surrender to the invading <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army" id="w">Imperial Japanese Army</a> force was and remains the largest capitulation in <a href="/wiki/British_military_history" id="w">British military history</a>, and it permanently undermined Britain&#39;s prestige as an imperial power in the <a href="/wiki/Far_East" id="w">Far East</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Morris_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Morris" title="">[2]</a></sup> However, current knowledge about the years of under-funding of <a href="/wiki/British_Malaya" id="w">Malaya</a>&#39;s defences and the inexperienced, under-equipped nature of the Commonwealth army makes it possible to hold a more sympathetic view of his command.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Childhood_and_employment" name="Childhood_and_employment"></a><h2>Childhood and employment</h2>
<p>Arthur Ernest Percival was born on <a href="/wiki/26_December" id="w">26 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1887" id="w">1887</a> in Aspenden Lodge, <a href="/wiki/Aspenden" id="w">Aspenden</a> near <a href="/wiki/Buntingford" id="w">Buntingford</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hertfordshire" id="w">Hertfordshire</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, the second son of Alfred Reginald and Edith Percival (née Miller). His father was the Land Agent of the Hamel&#39;s Park estate and his mother came from a <a href="/wiki/Lancashire" id="w">Lancashire</a> <a href="/wiki/Cotton" id="w">cotton</a> family.</p>
<p>Percival was initially schooled locally in <a href="/wiki/Bengeo" id="w">Bengeo</a>. Then in 1901, he was sent to <a href="/wiki/Rugby_School" id="w">Rugby</a> with his more academically successful brother, where he was a boarder in School House. A moderate pupil, he studied <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" id="w">Greek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> but was described by a teacher as &#34;not a good classic&#34;.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Percival&#39;s only qualification on leaving in 1906 was a higher school certificate. He was a more successful sportsman, playing <a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">cricket</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tennis" id="w">tennis</a> and running <a href="/wiki/Cross-country_running" id="w">cross country</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> He also rose to <a href="/wiki/Colour_Sergeant" id="w">colour sergeant</a> in the school&#39;s Volunteer Rifle Corps. However, his military career began at a comparatively late age: although a member of Youngsbury Rifle Club, he was still working as a clerk for the iron-ore merchants Naylor, Benzon &#38; Company Limited in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, which he had joined in 1907, when the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">Great War</a> broke out. But for this conflict, it seems certain that he would have remained a <a href="/wiki/Civilian" id="w">civilian</a>.</p>

<p>Percival enlisted on the first day of the war as a <a href="/wiki/Private_(rank)" id="w">private</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Officer_Training_Corps" id="w">Officer Training Corps</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Inns_of_Court" id="w">Inns of Court</a>, at the age of 26, and was promoted after five weeks&#39; basic training to acting <a href="/wiki/Second_lieutenant" id="w">second lieutenant</a>. Nearly one third of his fellow recruits would be dead by the end of the war. The following year Percival was dispatched to <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> with the newly formed 7th (Service) Battalion of the <a href="/wiki/Bedfordshire" id="w">Bedfordshire</a> Regiment, which became part of the 54th Brigade, <a href="/wiki/18th_(Eastern)_Division" id="w">18th (Eastern) Division</a> in February 1915. The first day of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme_(1916)" id="w">Battle of the Somme</a> (<a href="/wiki/1_July" id="w">1 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1916" id="w">1916</a>) left Percival unscathed, but in September he was badly wounded in four places by <a href="/wiki/Shrapnel" id="w">shrapnel</a>, as he led his company in an assault on the <a href="/wiki/Schwaben_Redoubt" id="w">Schwaben Redoubt</a>, beyond the ruins of <a href="/wiki/Thiepval" id="w">Thiepval</a> village, and was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Military_Cross" id="w">Military Cross</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Percival took a regular commission as a <a href="/wiki/Captain_(military)" id="w">captain</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Essex_Regiment" id="w">Essex Regiment</a> in October 1916, whilst recovering from his injuries in hospital. In 1917, he became battalion commander with the temporary rank of <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-Colonel_(UK)" id="w">lieutenant-colonel</a>. During <a href="/wiki/German_Empire" id="w">Germany</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Spring_Offensive" id="w">Spring Offensive</a>, Percival led a counter-attack that saved a unit of French artillery from capture, winning a <a href="/wiki/Croix_de_Guerre" id="w">Croix de Guerre</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> For a short period in May 1918, he acted as commander of the 54th Brigade.

<a id="Ireland" name="Ireland"></a><h2>Ireland</h2>
<p>More controversially, in 1920 Percival served in <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a>, fighting the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army" id="w">Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA) during the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Irish_War" id="w">Anglo-Irish War</a>.  There, he was a company commander and later the <a href="/wiki/Intelligence_officer" id="w">intelligence officer</a> of the 1st Battalion of the <a href="/wiki/Essex_Regiment" id="w">Essex Regiment</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Kinsale" id="w">Kinsale</a>, <a href="/wiki/County_Cork" id="w">County Cork</a>. </p>
<p>Percival was an energetic <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare#Counter-guerrilla warfare" id="w">counter-guerrilla</a> and he soon developed a reputation for brutality amongst the Irish.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> IRA leader, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Barry" id="w">Tom Barry</a>, wrote <i>&#34;This officer was easily the most viciously anti-Irish of serving British officers. He was tireless in his attempts to destroy the spirit of the people...&#34;</i>  .<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> According to Coogan, Percival <i>&#34;had a habit of driving about the countryside in the mornings in an open touring car so that he could &#39;have cock shots at farmers working in the fields&#39;.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Following the killing of a <a href="/wiki/Royal_Irish_Constabulary" id="w">Royal Irish Constabulary</a> sergeant outside Bandon church in July 1920, he captured <a href="/wiki/Tom_Hales" id="w">Tom Hales</a>, commander of the IRA&#39;s West Cork Brigade, and <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Harte" id="w">Patrick Harte</a>, the brigade&#39;s quartermaster, and won an <a href="/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" id="w">OBE</a>; but there were allegations that these and other prisoners were maltreated whilst in custody. He was unable to capture Tom Barry, despite once having the opportunity to interrogate him and unsuspectingly ordering his release.</p>
<p>The IRA placed a bounty of <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" id="w">£1</a>,000 on Percival&#39;s head, seeing him as responsible for the &#34;Essex Battalion Torture Squad&#34;, but a first attempted assassination by Barry in <a href="/wiki/Bandon%2C_County_Cork" id="w"> Bandon</a> failed when Percival departed from his dinnertime routine.  A second assassination squad was dispatched to London in March 1921, but was forced to flee <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_Street_Station" id="w">Liverpool Street Station</a> when the <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Police" id="w">police</a> learned of their plans. Back in Ireland, Percival led a raid that killed one of the would-be assassins.</p>
<p>Whilst in Ireland, <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Law_Montgomery%2C_1st_Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein" id="w">Bernard Montgomery</a>, who was serving in the same brigade, made Percival&#39;s acquaintance and they later exchanged letters on their experiences in this war.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/David_Lloyd_George" id="w">David Lloyd George</a> and <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill" id="w">Winston Churchill</a> also met Percival in 1921, when he was called as an expert witness during an inquiry into the Anglo-Irish War.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Staff_officer" name="Staff_officer"></a><h2>Staff officer</h2>
<p>Percival attended the <a href="/wiki/Staff_College%2C_Camberley" id="w">Staff College, Camberley</a> from 1923 to 1924, then commanded by General <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Ironside%2C_1st_Baron_Ironside" id="w">Edmund Ironside</a>, where he was taught by <a href="/wiki/J.F.C._Fuller" id="w">J.F.C. Fuller</a>, who was one of the few sympathetic reviewers of his book, <i>The War in Malaya</i>, twenty-five years later. He impressed his instructors, who picked him out as one of eight students for accelerated promotion, and his fellow students who admired his cricketing skills. Following an appointment as major with the <a href="/wiki/Cheshire_Regiment" id="w">Cheshire Regiment</a>, he spent four years with the <a href="/wiki/Nigeria_Regiment" id="w">Nigeria Regiment</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_West_African_Frontier_Force" id="w">Royal West African Frontier Force</a> in <a href="/wiki/West_Africa" id="w">West Africa</a> as a staff officer.

<div class="thumbcaption">The Royal Naval College, where Percival studied in 1930</div>
In 1930, Percival spent a year studying at the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Naval_College%2C_Greenwich" id="w">Royal Naval College, Greenwich</a>. From 1931 to 1932, Percival was General Staff Officer Grade 2, an instructor at the Staff College. The College&#39;s commandant General Sir <a href="/wiki/John_Dill" id="w">John Dill</a>, became Percival&#39;s mentor over the next 10 years, helping to ensure his protégé&#39;s advancement. Dill regarded Percival as a promising officer and wrote that &#34;he has an outstanding ability, wide military knowledge, good judgment and is a very quick and accurate worker&#34; but added &#34;he has not altogether an impressive presence and one may therefore fail, at first meeting him, to appreciate his sterling worth&#34;.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> With Dill&#39;s support, Percival was appointed to command the 2nd Battalion, the Cheshire Regiment from 1932 to 1936, initially in <a href="/wiki/Malta" id="w">Malta</a>. In 1935, he attended the <a href="/wiki/Royal_College_of_Defence_Studies" id="w">Imperial Defence College</a>. </p>
<p>Percival was made a full <a href="/wiki/Colonel_(UK)" id="w">colonel</a> and from 1936 to 1938 he was General Staff Officer Grade 1 in <a href="/wiki/British_Malaya" id="w">Malaya</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_staff_(military)" id="w">Chief of Staff</a> to <a href="/wiki/General_(United_Kingdom)" id="w">General</a> <a href="/wiki/William_Dobbie" id="w">Dobbie</a>, the <a href="/wiki/General_Officer_Commanding" id="w">General Officer Commanding</a> in Malaya. During this time, he recognised that Singapore was no longer an isolated fortress.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> He considered the possibility of the <a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> landing in <a href="/wiki/Thailand" id="w">Thailand</a> to &#34;burgle Malaya by the backdoor<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> and conducted an appraisal of the possibility of an attack being launched on Singapore from the North, which was supplied to the <a href="/wiki/War_Office" id="w">War Office</a>, and which Percival subsequently felt was similar to the plan followed by the Japanese in 1941.<sup id="_ref-percival1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-percival1" title="">[19]</a></sup> He also supported Dobbie&#39;s unexecuted plan for the construction of fixed defences in Southern <a href="/wiki/Johore" id="w">Johore</a>. In March 1938, he returned to Britain and was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Brigadier" id="w">brigadier</a> on the General Staff, <a href="/wiki/Aldershot" id="w">Aldershot</a> Command.</p>

<p>Percival was appointed Brigadier, General Staff, of the <a href="/wiki/British_I_Corps" id="w">I Corps</a>, <a href="/wiki/British_Expeditionary_Force" id="w">British Expeditionary Force</a>, commanded by General Dill, from 1939 to 1940.

Given command of the <a href="/wiki/British_44th_(Home_Counties)_Infantry_Division" id="w">44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division</a>, he spent 9 months organising the <a href="/wiki/British_anti-invasion_preparations_of_World_War_II" id="w">protection of 62 miles</a> of the <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> coast from invasion.<sup id="_ref-percival2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-percival2" title="">[20]</a></sup> He was created Companion of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath" id="w">Order of the Bath</a> (CB) in 1941.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Percival's_Early_Hypothesis_To_The_Fall_Of_Singapore" name="Percival's_Early_Hypothesis_To_The_Fall_Of_Singapore"></a><h2>Percival&#39;s Early Hypothesis To The Fall Of Singapore</h2>
<p>In 1936, <a href="/wiki/Major-General_(UK)" id="w">Major-General</a> <a href="/wiki/William_Dobbie" id="w">William Dobbie</a>, then General Officer Commanding (Malaya), made an inquiry to find out if more forces were required on mainland Malaya, so as to prevent the likelihood of Japanese landings and capturing forward bases to attack Singapore. Percival, then his Chief Staff Officer, was tasked to draw up a tactical appreciation on how the Japanese were most likely to attack.
In late 1937, the tactical appreciation duly confirmed that north <a href="/wiki/Malaya" id="w">Malaya</a> might become the critical battleground. The Japanese were likely to seize the east coast landing sites, on <a href="/wiki/Thailand" id="w">Thailand</a> and Malaya in order to capture aerodromes and achieve air superiority. This could prelude to further Japanese landings in <a href="/wiki/Johore" id="w">Johore</a> to disrupt communications northwards and the construction of another main base in North Borneo. From North Borneo, the final sea and air assault could be launched against eastern Singapore - against <a href="/wiki/Changi" id="w">Changi</a> area. <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<a id="General_Officer_Commanding_(Malaya)" name="General_Officer_Commanding_(Malaya)"></a><h2>General Officer Commanding (Malaya)</h2>
<p>In May 1941 Percival was given a temporary promotion to acting <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-General_(UK)" id="w">Lieutenant-General</a> and was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Malaya. This was a significant promotion for him as he had never commanded an army <a href="/wiki/Corps" id="w">Corps</a>. He left Britain in a <a href="/wiki/Sunderland_flying_boat" id="w">Sunderland flying boat</a> and embarked on an arduous two week, multi-stage flight via <a href="/wiki/Gibraltar" id="w">Gibraltar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malta" id="w">Malta</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alexandria" id="w">Alexandria</a> (where he was delayed by the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Iraqi_War" id="w">Anglo-Iraqi War</a>), <a href="/wiki/Basra" id="w">Basra</a>, <a href="/wiki/Karachi" id="w">Karachi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yangon" id="w">Rangoon</a>, where he was met by an <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" id="w">RAF</a> transport.<sup id="_ref-percival1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-percival1" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Percival had mixed feelings about his appointment, noting that &#34;In going to Malaya I realised that there was the double danger either of being left in an inactive command for some years if war did not break out in the East or, if it did, of finding myself involved in a pretty sticky business with the inadequate forces which are usually to be found in the distant parts of our <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">Empire</a> in the early stages of a war.&#34;<sup id="_ref-percival2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-percival2" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>For much of the interwar period, Britain&#39;s defensive plan for Malaya had centred on the dispatch of a <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" id="w">naval</a> fleet to the newly built <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Naval_Base" id="w">Singapore Naval Base</a>. Accordingly, the army&#39;s role was to defend Singapore and Southern <a href="/wiki/Johore" id="w">Johore</a>. Whilst this plan had seemed adequate when the nearest Japanese base had been 1,700 miles away, the outbreak of war in <a href="/wiki/European_Theatre_of_World_War_II" id="w">Europe</a>, combined with the partial Japanese occupation of the northern part of <a href="/wiki/French_Indochina" id="w">French Indochina</a> and the signing of the <a href="/wiki/Tripartite_Pact" id="w">Tripartite Pact</a> in September 1940, had underlined the difficulty of a sea-based defence. Instead it was proposed to use the RAF to defend Malaya, at least until reinforcements could be dispatched from Britain. This led to the building of airfields in northern Malaya and along its east coast and the dispersal of the available army units around the peninsula to protect them.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>On arrival, Percival set about training his inexperienced army, with his Indian troops being particularly raw, with most of their experienced officers having been withdrawn to support the formation of new units as the Indian army expanded. Relying upon commercial aircraft or the Volunteer air force to overcome the shortage of RAF planes, he toured the peninsula and encouraged the building of defensive works around <a href="/wiki/Jitra" id="w">Jitra</a>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> A training manual approved by Percival, <i>Tactical Notes on Malaya</i>, was distributed to all units.</p>
<p>In July 1941 when the Japanese occupied southern Indochina, economic <a href="/wiki/International_sanctions" id="w">sanctions</a> were invoked by Britain, the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a>, freezing financial assets and cutting Japan from its supplies of <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" id="w">oil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tin" id="w">tin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rubber" id="w">rubber</a>. Given their on-going <a href="/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War" id="w">involvement in China</a>, this put Japan in an unsustainable position. Both the Japanese navy and army were mobilised, but for the moment an uneasy state of cold war persisted. British Commonwealth reinforcements continued to trickle into Malaya. On <a href="/wiki/2_December" id="w">2 December</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Battleship" id="w">battleship</a> <a href="/wiki/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_(1939)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Prince of Wales&#39;&#39;</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Battle-cruiser" id="w">battle-cruiser</a> <a href="/wiki/HMS_Repulse_(1916)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Repulse&#39;&#39;</a>, escorted by four <a href="/wiki/Destroyer" id="w">destroyers</a>, arrived in Singapore, the first time a battle fleet had been based there.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/8_December" id="w">8 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a> the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_Twenty-Fifth_Army" id="w">Japanese 25th Army</a> under the command of Lieutenant-General <a href="/wiki/Tomoyuki_Yamashita" id="w">Tomoyuki Yamashita</a> <a href="/wiki/Amphibious_assault" id="w">landed</a> on the Malay Peninsula (one hour before the <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" id="w">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>; the difference in date was because the two places lie on opposite sides of the <a href="/wiki/International_date_line" id="w">international date line</a>). That night the first Japanese invasion force arrived at <a href="/wiki/Kota_Bharu" id="w">Kota Bharu</a> on Malaya&#39;s east coast. This was just a diversionary force, and the main landings took place the next day at <a href="/wiki/Singora" id="w">Singora</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pattani_(town)" id="w">Pattani</a> on the south-eastern coast of <a href="/wiki/Thailand" id="w">Thailand</a>, with troops rapidly deploying over the border into northern Malaya.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/10_December" id="w">10 December</a> Percival issued a stirring, if ultimately ineffective, Special Order of the Day:</p>
<p /><blockquote>In this hour of trial the General Officer Commanding calls upon all ranks Malaya Command for a determined and sustained effort to safeguard Malaya and the adjoining British territories. The eyes of the Empire are upon us. Our whole position in the Far East is at stake. The struggle may be long and grim but let us all resolve to stand fast come what may and to prove ourselves worthy of the great trust which has been placed in us.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></blockquote>

</p>
<p>The Japanese advanced rapidly, and on <a href="/wiki/27_January" id="w">27 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a> Percival ordered a general retreat across the <a href="/wiki/Johore_Strait" id="w">Johore Strait</a> to the island of <a href="/wiki/Singapore" id="w">Singapore</a> and organised a defence along the length of the island&#39;s 70-mile coast line. But the Japanese did not dawdle, and on <a href="/wiki/8_February" id="w">8 February</a> Japanese troops landed on the northwest corner of Singapore island. After a week of fighting on the island, Percival held his final command conference at 9 a.m. on <a href="/wiki/15_February" id="w">15 February</a> in <a href="/wiki/The_Battle_Box" id="w">the Battle Box</a> of <a href="/wiki/Fort_Canning" id="w">Fort Canning</a>. The Japanese had already occupied approximately half of Singapore and it was clear that the island would soon fall.  Having been told that ammunition and water would both run out by the following day, Percival agreed to surrender. General Yamashita was willing to accept a British surrender since his own forces were running low on artillery shells but Percival did not know this.  </p>
<p>The Japanese insisted that Percival himself march under a <a href="/wiki/White_flag" id="w">white flag</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Old_Ford_Motor_Factory" id="w">Old Ford Motor Factory</a> in <a href="/wiki/Bukit_Timah" id="w">Bukit Timah</a> to negotiate the surrender. A Japanese officer present noted that he looked &#34;pale, thin and tired&#34;.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> After a brief disagreement, when Percival insisted that the British keep 1,000 men under arms in Singapore to preserve order, which Yamashita finally conceded, it was agreed at 6.10 p.m. that the British Commonwealth troops would lay down their arms and cease resistance at 8.30 p.m. This was in spite of instructions from Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill" id="w">Winston Churchill</a> for prolonged resistance.<sup id="_ref-Morris_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Morris" title="">[2]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Pacific_War" id="w">Pacific War</a> was just ten weeks old.</p>
<p>A common view holds that 138,708 <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" id="w">Allied</a> personnel surrendered or were killed by fewer than 30,000 Japanese. However, the former figure includes nearly 50,000 troops captured or killed during the Battle of Malaya, and perhaps 15,000 base troops. Many of the other troops were tired and under-equipped following their retreat from the Malayan peninsula. Conversely, the latter number represents only the front-line troops available for the invasion of Singapore. British Commonwealth battle casualties since <a href="/wiki/8_December" id="w">8 December</a> amounted to 7,500 killed and 11,000 wounded. Japanese losses totalled around 3,500 killed and 6,100 wounded.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

</p>
<p>Churchill viewed the fall of Singapore to be &#34;the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history.&#34; However, Britain&#39;s defence, the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" id="w">Middle East</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> had all received higher priorities in the allocation of men and material, so the desired <a href="/wiki/Air_force" id="w">air force</a> strength of 300 to 500 aircraft was never reached; whereas the Japanese invaded with over two hundred <a href="/wiki/Tank" id="w">tanks</a>, the British Army in Malaya did not have a single one.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1918, Percival had been described as &#34;a slim, soft spoken man… with a proven reputation for bravery and organisational powers&#34;<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> but by 1945 this description had been turned on its head with even Percival&#39;s defenders describing him as &#34;something of a damp squib&#34;.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> The fall of Singapore switched Percival&#39;s reputation to that of an ineffective &#34;staff wallah&#34;, lacking ruthlessness and aggression, even though few doubted that he was a brave and determined officer. Over six feet in height and lanky, with a clipped moustache and two protruding teeth, and decidedly unphotogenic, Percival was an easy target for a caricaturist, being described as &#34;tall, bucktoothed and lightly built&#34;.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> There was no doubt his presentation lacked impact as &#34;his manner was low key and he was a poor public speaker with the cusp of a lisp&#34;.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>It has been argued that Percival&#39;s colleagues bear a share of the responsibility of defeat. Air Chief Marshal Sir <a href="/wiki/Henry_Robert_Moore_Brooke-Popham" id="w">Robert Brooke-Popham</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Commander-in-Chief" id="w">Commander-in-Chief</a> of the <a href="/wiki/British_Far_East_Command" id="w">British Far East Command</a>, refused Percival permission to launch <a href="/wiki/Operation_Matador" id="w">Operation Matador</a> in advance of the Japanese landings in Thailand, not wishing to run any risk of provoking the coming war. Brooke-Popham also had a reputation for being &#34;past it&#34;, falling asleep in meetings and not arguing forcefully for the air reinforcements required to defend Malaya. Whilst Admiral <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Spencer_Vaughan_Phillips" id="w">Tom Phillips</a> was undoubtedly brave, his bold leadership of Force Z led to his demise and the <a href="/wiki/Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse" id="w">destruction of the British fleet</a> on <a href="/wiki/10_December" id="w">10 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, early in the campaign.</p>
<p>Others suggest that the government in London was more to blame than any of the British commanders in the Far East.  Despite repeated requests, the British government did not provide the necessary reinforcements and they denied Brooke-Popham (and therefore Percival) the permission to enter neutral Thailand before it was too late to put in place forward defences.<sup id="_ref-ODNB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ODNB" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, Percival had difficulties with his subordinates Sir <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Heath" id="w">Lewis &#34;Piggy&#34; Heath</a>, commanding <a href="/wiki/Indian_III_Corps" id="w">Indian III Corps</a>, and the independent-minded <a href="/wiki/Henry_Gordon_Bennett" id="w">Gordon Bennett</a>, commanding the <a href="/wiki/Australian_8th_Division" id="w">Australian 8th Division</a>. The former officer had been senior to Percival prior to his appointment as GOC (Malaya) and found it difficult to serve under him. Bennett was full of confidence in his <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australian</a> troops and his own ability, but faced a mixed reaction in Australia when he escaped from Singapore immediately after <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore" id="w">its surrender</a>.</p>
<p>Percival was ultimately responsible for the men who served under him, and with other officers &#8211; notably Major-General <a href="/wiki/David_Murray-Lyon" id="w">David Murray-Lyon</a> commander of the <a href="/wiki/Indian_11th_Infantry_Division" id="w">Indian 11th Infantry Division</a> &#8211; he had shown a willingness to replace them when he felt their performance was not up to scratch. Perhaps his greatest mistake was to resist the building of fixed defences in either Johore or the north shore of Singapore, dismissing them in the face of repeated requests to start construction from his Chief Engineer, Brigadier <a href="/wiki/Ivan_Simson" id="w">Ivan Simson</a>, with the comment &#34;Defences are bad for morale — for both troops and civilians&#34;.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> In doing so, Percival threw away the potential advantages he could have derived from the 6,000 engineers under his command and perhaps missed his best chance to blunt the danger posed by the Japanese tanks.</p>
<p>Percival also insisted on defending the north-eastern shore of Singapore most heavily, against the advice of the <a href="/wiki/American-British-Dutch-Australian_Command" id="w">Allied supreme commander in South East Asia</a>, General <a href="/wiki/Archibald_Percival_Wavell%2C_1st_Earl_Wavell" id="w">Archibald Wavell</a>. Percival was perhaps fixed on his responsibilities for defending the Singapore Naval Base.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> He also spread his forces thinly around the island and kept few units as a strategic reserve. When the Japanese attack came in the west, the <a href="/wiki/Australian_22nd_Brigade" id="w">Australian 22nd Brigade</a> took the brunt of the assault.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> Percival refused to reinforce them as he continued to believe that the main assault would occur in the north east.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The signing of the Japanese surrender; <a href="/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur" id="w">MacArthur</a> (sitting), behind him are Generals Percival and Wainwright.</div></p>
<p>Percival himself was briefly held prisoner in <a href="/wiki/Changi_Prison" id="w">Changi Prison</a>, where &#34;the defeated GOC could be seen sitting head in hands, outside the married quarters he now shared with seven brigadiers, a colonel, his ADC and cook-sergeant. He discussed feelings with few, spent hours walking around the extensive compound, ruminating on the reverse and what might have been&#34;.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> In the belief that it would improve discipline, he reconstituted a Malaya Command, complete with staff appointments, and helped occupy his fellow prisoners with lectures on the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_France" id="w">Battle of France</a>.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Along with the other senior British captives above the rank of colonel, Percival was removed from Singapore in August 1942. First he was imprisoned in <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" id="w">Formosa</a> and then sent on to <a href="/wiki/Manchuria" id="w">Manchuria</a>, where he was held with several dozen other VIP captives, including the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> General <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Mayhew_Wainwright_IV" id="w">Jonathan Wainwright</a>, in a <a href="/wiki/Prisoner-of-war_camp" id="w">prisoner-of-war camp</a> near Hsian, about 100 miles to the north east of <a href="/wiki/Mukden" id="w">Mukden</a>.</p>
<p>As the war drew to an end, an <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services" id="w">OSS</a> team removed the prisoners from Hsian. Percival was then taken, along with Wainwright, to stand immediately behind General <a href="/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur" id="w">Douglas MacArthur</a> as he confirmed the terms of the Japanese surrender aboard the <a href="/wiki/USS_Missouri_(BB-63)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Missouri&#39;&#39;</a> (BB-63) in <a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Bay" id="w">Tokyo Bay</a> on <a href="/wiki/2_September" id="w">2 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Afterwards, MacArthur gave Percival one of the pens he had used to sign the treaty.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>Percival and Wainwright then returned together to the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippines</a> to witness the surrender of the Japanese army there, which in a twist of fate was commanded by General Yamashita. The Tiger of Malaya was momentarily surprised to see his former captive at the ceremony. The flag carried by Percival&#39;s party on the way to Bukit Timah was also a witness to this reversal of fortunes, being flown when the Japanese formally surrendered Singapore back to Lord <a href="/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten%2C_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma" id="w">Louis Mountbatten</a>.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>

<p>Percival returned to Britain in September 1945 to write his dispatch at the <a href="/wiki/War_Office" id="w">War Office</a> but this was revised by the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">UK Government</a> and only published in 1948. He retired from the army in 1946 with the honorary rank of lieutenant-general but only the pension of a major-general. Thereafter, he held appointments connected with the county of Hertfordshire, where he lived at Bullards in <a href="/wiki/Widford" id="w">Widford</a>: he was Honorary Colonel of the 479th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) H.A.A. Regiment <a href="/wiki/Territorial_Army" id="w">T.A.</a> from 1949 to 1954<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> and acted as one of the <a href="/wiki/Deputy_Lieutenant" id="w">Deputy Lieutenants</a> of Hertfordshire in 1951.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> He continued his relationship with the Cheshire Regiment being appointed Colonel of the Cheshire Regiment between 1950 and 1955;<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> an association continued by his son, <a href="/wiki/Brigadier" id="w">Brigadier</a> James Percival who became Colonel of the Regiment between 1992 and 1999.</p>
<p>While General Wainwright had become a public hero on his return to the United States, Percival found himself disparaged for his leadership in Malaya, even by Lieutenant-General Heath, his erstwhile subordinate. Percival&#39;s 1949 memoir, <i>The War in Malaya</i>, did little to quell this criticism, being a restrained rather than self-serving account of the campaign. Unusually for a British lieutenant-general, Percival was not awarded a <a href="/wiki/British_honours_system" id="w">knighthood</a>.</p>
<p>Percival was respected for the time he had spent as a Japanese <a href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_war" id="w">prisoner of war</a>. Serving as life president of the <a href="/wiki/Far_East_Prisoners_of_War" id="w">Far East Prisoners of War</a> Association (FEPOW), he pushed for compensation for his fellow captives, eventually helping to obtain a token £5 million of frozen Japanese assets for this cause. This was distributed by the FEPOW Welfare Trust, which Percival served as Chairman.<sup id="_ref-MacArthur442_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacArthur442" title="">[47]</a></sup> He led protests against the film <i><a href="/wiki/The_Bridge_on_the_River_Kwai" id="w">The Bridge on the River Kwai</a></i> when it was released in 1957, obtaining the addition of an on-screen statement that the movie was a work of fiction. He also worked as President of the Hertfordshire <a href="/wiki/British_Red_Cross" id="w">British Red Cross</a> and was made an Officer of the <a href="/wiki/Venerable_Order_of_St_John" id="w">Order of St. John</a> in 1964.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Percival died at the age of 78 on <a href="/wiki/31_January" id="w">31 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1966" id="w">1966</a>, in King Edward VII&#39;s Hospital for Officers, Beaumont Street in <a href="/wiki/Westminster" id="w">Westminster</a>, and was buried in Hertfordshire. <a href="/wiki/John_Leonard_Wilson" id="w">Leonard Wilson</a>, formerly the <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Singapore" id="w">Bishop of Singapore</a>, gave the address at his memorial service, which was held in <a href="/wiki/St_Martin-in-the-Fields" id="w">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a>.</p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/27_July" id="w">27 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1927" id="w">1927</a> Percival married Margaret Elizabeth &#34;Betty&#34; MacGregor (who died in 1956) in <a href="/wiki/Holy_Trinity_Brompton_Church" id="w">Holy Trinity Church</a>, <a href="/wiki/West_Brompton" id="w">West Brompton</a>.

They had met during his tour of duty in Ireland and it had taken Percival several years to propose. They had two children. A daughter, Dorinda Margery, was born in Greenwich and became <a href="/wiki/Baron_Dunleath" id="w">Lady Dunleath</a>. <a href="/wiki/Alfred_James_MacGregor" id="w">Alfred James MacGregor</a>, their son, was born in <a href="/wiki/Singapore" id="w">Singapore</a> and also served in the British Army.
