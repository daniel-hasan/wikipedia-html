Scenario writer <a href="/wiki/Kazushige_Nojima" id="w">Kazushige Nojima</a> stresses the dynamic of players&#39; relationships with the main character in <i>Final Fantasy</i> games; thus, he puts significant thought into how that relationship will develop. With <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII" id="w">Final Fantasy VII</a></i>, protagonist <a href="/wiki/Cloud_Strife" id="w">Cloud Strife</a>&#39;s reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud&#39;s responses to certain situations and dialogue. With <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i>, which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall, Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist is thinking, even while other characters remain uninformed.<sup id="_ref-interviews_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interviews" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, while exchanging e-mails with director <a href="/wiki/Yoshinori_Kitase" id="w">Yoshinori Kitase</a> during the period between the development of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> and <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i>, suggested that the game should have a &#34;school days&#34; feel. Because Nojima already had a story in mind in which the main characters were the same age, the idea worked. Thus, they created the concept of military academies, called &#34;Gardens&#34;, in which students would train to become &#34;SeeD&#34; mercenaries. Nojima also planned for the two playable parties featured in the game — Squall&#39;s present day group and Laguna Loire&#39;s group of twenty years in the past — to highly contrast with one another. On one hand, Laguna&#39;s group consists of characters in their late twenties and have a lot of combat experience. They are also close friends who have fought together for a long time and trust one another. On the other hand, Squall&#39;s party is young and inexperienced, and Squall himself does not initially understand the value of friendship.<sup id="_ref-sheila_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sheila" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a result of Kitase&#39;s desire to give the game a foreign atmosphere (&#34;foreign&#34; being in relation to <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>), the objective with the character designs was to create largely <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">European</a> appearances. The first character Nomura designed specifically for use in <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i> was Squall,<sup id="_ref-development2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-development2" title="">[8]</a></sup> initially giving him longer hair and a more feminine appearance. However, Yoshinori Kitase did not feel that this design worked and asked Nomura to shorten his hair and make him look more masculine, which led to the design seen in-game. When designing Cloud Strife, Nomura gave him distinctly spiky, bright blonde hair to emphasize his role as that game&#39;s protagonist. With Squall, Nomura wanted to try a unique angle to establish his role, giving him the characteristic gunblade scar across the bridge of his nose. A complete history was not yet conceived, so Nomura left the explanation for Squall&#39;s scar to Nojima. Squall&#39;s design was completed by a feather motif along the collar of his jacket, included for the purpose of challenging the game&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Full_motion_video" id="w">full motion video</a> designers. This is but one example of the demands he has consistently extended to the programmers of the <i>Final Fantasy</i> titles as technology has advanced.<sup id="_ref-sheila_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sheila" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a <i><a href="/wiki/Famitsu" id="w">Famitsu Weekly</a></i> interview with Kitase, Nomura and Yuusuke Naoi, the team agreed that <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i> reflects Nomura&#39;s preferred technique, as opposed to <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>, which featured characters that &#34;weren&#39;t really his style&#34;.<sup id="_ref-development2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-development2" title="">[8]</a></sup> The team also decided to use realistically proportioned characters. The higher level of full motion video technology would have otherwise created an inconsistency between the in-game graphics and the higher definition full motion video graphics. Additionally, Kitase explained that the main logo of the game — Squall and Rinoa embracing — was inspired by the team&#39;s efforts to express emotion through body language.<sup id="_ref-development2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-development2" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Laguna" name="Laguna"></a><h2>Laguna</h2>
<p>{{nihongo}} is a man whose past and relation to the main characters are revealed slowly throughout the game. Most of the sequences involving Laguna appear in the form of &#34;dreams&#34; experienced by the protagonists. Squall always experiences these dreams from Laguna&#39;s point of view, although he does not think too highly of Laguna.<sup id="_ref-moron_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-moron" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-badattitude_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-badattitude" title="">[16]</a></sup> Laguna attacks with a machine gun and his Limit Break, <i>Desperado</i>,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> involves a swinging rope, a grenade and a lot of bullets.

<p>The concept of two main characters was planned since the beginning of the game&#39;s development. Nomura tried to create a contrast between Laguna&#39;s and Squall&#39;s occupations; thus, Laguna became a soldier and Squall became a mercenary student. The designers intended Laguna to be more similar to the previous protagonists in the series to complement Squall, who is different from previous main characters.<sup id="_ref-sheila_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sheila" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Seifer" name="Seifer"></a><h2>Seifer</h2>
<p>{{nihongo}} is a classmate and rival of Squall, and can only be controlled by the player during the Dollet sequence. He reappears as a <a href="/wiki/Boss_(video_games)" id="w">boss</a> later in the game. He acts as a mirror to Squall in many respects, having dated Rinoa before she met Squall,<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> and assuming a leadership position among his friends.<sup id="_ref-Posse1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Posse1" title="">[26]</a></sup> Like Squall, Seifer wields a gunblade which he calls &#34;<a href="/wiki/Hyperion_(mythology)" id="w">Hyperion</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> His Limit Break, <i>Fire Cross</i>, allows him to use an attack called <i>No Mercy</i>. He later uses the more powerful techniques <i>Demon Slice</i> and <i>Bloodfest</i> against the player. Seifer has a short temper and is often depicted as a bully who desires attention.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-SeiferSquall_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SeiferSquall" title="">[29]</a></sup> He is also fiercely independent and is often punished for his recklessness.<sup id="_ref-CidSeifer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CidSeifer" title="">[30]</a></sup> He is the leader of Balamb Garden&#39;s disciplinary committee with his friends <a href="/wiki/#Fujin" id="w">Fujin</a> and <a href="/wiki/#Raijin" id="w">Raijin</a>. After joining Ultimecia, he becomes the leader of the Galbadian army.</p>
<p>During the introduction sequence, Seifer cuts Squall across the left side of his face with his gunblade, leaving a scar. Squall retaliates with a backhand slash that leaves Seifer with a mirrored scar. At the following field exam in Dollet, Seifer acts independently from his teammates Squall and <a href="/wiki/#Zell" id="w">Zell</a>, abandoning them; consequently, he fails and is not promoted to SeeD.<sup id="_ref-CidSeifer_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CidSeifer" title="">[30]</a></sup> Spurred by dreams of a brighter future, he <a href="/wiki/Defection" id="w">defects</a> to <a href="/wiki/#Edea" id="w">Sorceress Edea</a> so he could be her &#34;knight&#34;.<sup id="_ref-knight_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knight" title="">[31]</a></sup> From his point of view, Squall and the others are &#34;evil&#34; and he recognizes himself as the hero.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> As Seifer is brainwashed by the sorceress, he alienates himself from his friends. Eventually, Fujin and Raijin abandon him and he is defeated shortly afterward.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> At the end of the game, Seifer is seen fishing and having fun with Fujin and Raijin again.</p>
<p>Nomura had originally intended Seifer not only as Squall&#39;s rival, but also as part of the <a href="/wiki/Love_triangle" id="w">love triangle</a> between him, Squall and Rinoa. Although this concept was not thoroughly explored in the final script, Seifer remains Squall&#39;s rival and his appearance was designed to contrast with Squall&#39;s. They have equivalent but mirrored scars on their faces and their jackets are of opposing color and length. Both characters use gunblades; Squall&#39;s gunblade is larger and requires two hands, while Seifer&#39;s gunblade is lighter and can be wielded with one hand.<sup id="_ref-sheila_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sheila" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A younger version of Seifer makes an appearance in <i><a href="/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_II" id="w">Kingdom Hearts II</a></i> as a member of the Twilight Town Disciplinary Committee with Fujin and Raijin.  Seifer in the Virtual Twilight Town is a rival of Roxas and at one point mentions that he does not wish to cooperate with destiny (or anyone according to Roxas). <sup id="_ref-KH2gamespot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KH2gamespot" title="">[34]</a></sup> In the English version, he is voiced by <a href="/wiki/Will_Friedle" id="w">Will Friedle</a>.<sup id="_ref-IMDB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IMDB" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

{{nihongo}} is an eighteen year old instructor at Balamb Garden, where Squall, Zell, and Seifer are students.<sup id="_ref-Manual6_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Manual6" title="">[4]</a></sup> She uses a <a href="/wiki/Chain_whip" id="w">chain whip</a> in battle,<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> and her Limit Break, <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_magic#Blue Magic" id="w">Blue Magic</a></i>, allows her to imitate monsters&#39; attacks.<sup id="_ref-LimitBreak_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LimitBreak" title="">[13]</a></sup> Emotionally, Quistis is insecure and prone to depression, although she tries to maintain a calm persona.<sup id="_ref-Manual6_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Manual6" title="">[4]</a></sup> Early in the game, Quistis is discharged as an instructor because she &#34;[lacks] leadership qualities&#34;.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> Afterwards, she maintains a more informal relationship with the other characters as a fellow member of SeeD.</p>
<p>As a child, Quistis stayed at an orphanage with most of the main characters. She then lived with <a href="/wiki/Foster_care" id="w">foster parents</a>, with whom she never developed any intimacy, before moving to Balamb Garden at age ten.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> She became a SeeD at fifteen and an instructor two years later.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Manual6_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Manual6" title="">[4]</a></sup> Quistis initially joins Squall to prepare him for his upcoming field exam. She later takes Squall into her confidence and tells him personally about her demotion.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> When Irvine refreshes the main characters&#39; memories about the orphanage, they remember that Squall&#39;s antisocial behavior began when Ellone, an older sister figure to Squall, left the orphanage unexpectedly. As a result of these revelations, Quistis recognizes that her feelings for Squall are more sisterly than romantic.<sup id="_ref-quistislove_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-quistislove" title="">[41]</a></sup> Later, she criticizes Squall when he nearly abandons Rinoa, his romantic interest.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>When designing the characters, Nomura had wanted at least one female character to wear a skirt. Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part, but Nomura decided a long skirt worn over pants would look better. The role was eventually passed to Selphie. Nomura was surprised when the writers cast her as a teacher, despite being around the same age as the rest of the group.<sup id="_ref-sheila_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sheila" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>With Irvine, Nomura tried to strike a balance between not overshadowing Squall and not becoming too unattractive. He gave Irvine a handsome appearance, but a casual personality, hoping that this would make him less attractive than Squall.

<p>Because most <i>Final Fantasy</i> titles include a character named &#34;Cid&#34;, Nomura wanted to design someone with differences from the past Cids in the series.

<p>Several other SeeD members assist Squall&#39;s party. Dr. Kadowaki is the Balamb Garden doctor who tends to Squall&#39;s wounds after his fight with Seifer in the opening sequence. She also helps Headmaster Cid after his confrontation with NORG. Nida is a student at Balamb Garden who passes the SeeD exam along with Squall.

<a id="NORG" name="NORG"></a><h2>NORG</h2>
<p>NORG is an exiled <a href="/wiki/World_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII#Creatures and races" id="w">Shumi</a> who lent Cid the money to build and develop the Garden and took the position of Garden Master upon its completion.<sup id="_ref-NORGhistory1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NORGhistory1" title="">[102]</a></sup> NORG is more concerned about the revenue acquired by SeeD as a mercenary organization rather than its noble duty of opposing the Sorceress; he is considered a &#34;black sheep&#34; of the Shumi tribe.<sup id="_ref-NORGhistory1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NORGhistory1" title="">[102]</a></sup> After hearing about a failed assassination attempt on Sorceress Edea, NORG begins to distrust Headmaster Cid and tries to seize control of Balamb Garden, causing a conflict between factions loyal to NORG and Cid. Feigning loyalty to the Sorceress, he attempts to kill the SeeDs who carried out the failed assassination.<sup id="_ref-NORGloyalty_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NORGloyalty" title="">[72]</a></sup> After he is defeated in battle, he enters a <a href="/wiki/Pupa#Cocoon" id="w">cocoon-like</a> state.

<a id="Reception_and_criticism" name="Reception_and_criticism"></a><h1>Reception and criticism</h1>
<p>The characters of <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i> have received praise by reviewers. The <i>Gaming Age</i> reviewer was originally concerned with the shift to consistently realistically proportioned characters, but he ultimately found them more appealing.<sup id="_ref-gamingage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamingage" title="">[109]</a></sup> Moreover, the review stated that the character designs and graphical quality allowed the characters to &#34;convey emotions much more dramatically&#34;.<sup id="_ref-gamingage_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamingage" title="">[109]</a></sup> <i>Game Revolution</i> cited similar praise, agreeing that the change &#34;really makes the graphics impressive&#34;.<sup id="_ref-gamerevolution_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamerevolution" title="">[110]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/IGN" id="w">IGN</a> commented that the &#34;low-polygon characters of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> are gone, replaced with sometimes surprisingly realistic high-polygon models that only look better the closer they get&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ignreview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignreview" title="">[9]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/GameSpot" id="w">GameSpot</a> agreed with the transition, claiming that &#34;involving, personal, and emotional stories are far more believable when they come from, well, people, not short, bizarrely shaped cartoon characters&#34;.<sup id="_ref-gamespot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespot" title="">[111]</a></sup></p>
<p>The cast itself has received criticism from reviews. IGN criticized the manner in which romantic interactions play out, stating that &#34;considering that the love story is so integral to everything that happens — not to mention forming the central image of the box art — it&#39;s incomprehensible why no one says &#39;I love you&#39; to anyone, ever.&#34;<sup id="_ref-ignreview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignreview" title="">[9]</a></sup> With Squall, IGN felt that &#34;FFVIII does break one cardinal rule: when your story is character centered, you&#39;d better center it on a character the audience can care about. Squall, unfortunately, just doesn&#39;t fit the bill&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ignreview_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignreview" title="">[9]</a></sup> However, <a href="/wiki/GameSpot" id="w">GameSpot</a> felt that <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i> shifts the story from the &#34;epic&#34; concepts of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> to the &#34;personal&#34;, in that &#34;the characters and their relationships are all extremely believable and complex; moreover, the core romance holds up even under the most pessimistic scrutiny&#34;.<sup id="_ref-gamespot_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespot" title="">[111]</a></sup> Although the reviewer at <i><a href="/wiki/Official_U.S._PlayStation_Magazine" id="w">Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine</a></i> acknowledged possible fears over a romantic storyline, he stated that &#34;it&#39;s only later in the game, once you are really attached to all the distinct and complex characters, that the more emotional themes are gradually introduced&#34;.<sup id="_ref-egmreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-egmreview" title="">[112]</a></sup></p>
