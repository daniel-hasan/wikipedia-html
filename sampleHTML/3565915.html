<b>Hurricane Nate</b> was a <a href="/wiki/Hurricane" id="w">hurricane</a> over the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic" id="w">Atlantic</a> during September in the <a href="/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. Nate was the fourteenth named storm and seventh hurricane of the season.</p>
<p>Hurricane Nate formed to the southwest of <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_5" id="w">September 5</a> and initially moved very slowly to the northeast. Forecasts initially suggested a possible threat to the island, but Nate passed well to the south on <a href="/wiki/September_8" id="w">September 8</a> as a Category 1 hurricane. After moving away from the island, wind shear increased and Nate weakened back into a tropical storm before becoming <a href="/wiki/Extratropical" id="w">extratropical</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_10" id="w">September 10</a>. There was no reported damage, although one death was reported off the <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a> coast due to <a href="/wiki/Rip_current" id="w">rip currents</a>.</p>

Tropical Depression Fifteen formed from a complex interaction between a weak tropical wave and a broad low pressure on the morning of <a href="/wiki/September_5" id="w">September 5</a> about 350 miles (560 km) south-southwest of <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a>.<sup id="_ref-NateTCR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NateTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup> The initial forecast called for only a modest increase in strength, but the depression intensified more quickly than predicted and became Tropical Storm Nate that afternoon, only six hours after it formed.<sup id="_ref-NHC-disc1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHC-disc1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Tropical Storm Nate moved very slowly to the northeast, as it was trapped between the circulations of <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Maria_(2005)" id="w">Hurricane Maria</a> to the north and the developing <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Ophelia_(2005)" id="w">Hurricane Ophelia</a> to the west. At this time, the forecasts indicated that Nate could pass close to <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a>.<sup id="_ref-NHC-disc5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHC-disc5" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Tropical Storm Nate strengthened further and became a hurricane on <a href="/wiki/September_7" id="w">September 7</a>, as it began to turn away from Bermuda. Some models indicated that Nate could be either be absorbed by or <a href="/wiki/Fujiwhara_effect" id="w">merge</a> with the larger Hurricane Maria, but the NHC forecasted that Nate would survive as a separate system, which it indeed did.<sup id="_ref-NHC-disc10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHC-disc10" title="">[4]</a></sup> Nate reached its peak intensity of 90 mph (145 km/h) late on <a href="/wiki/September_8" id="w">September 8</a> as it passed 120 miles (205 km) southeast of Bermuda with its strongest winds remaining well offshore.<sup id="_ref-NateTCR_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NateTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Soon after Hurricane Nate had reached its peak strength, increasing wind shear and dry air caused it to weaken back into a tropical storm late on <a href="/wiki/September_9" id="w">September 9</a>. Nate accelerated to the northeast, following Maria&#39;s path into the open <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a>. Nate became extratropical the next day and did not reintensify again before becoming absorbed by a larger system on <a href="/wiki/September_12" id="w">September 12</a>.<sup id="_ref-NateTCR_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NateTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Impact" name="Impact"></a><h2>Impact</h2>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" id="w">tropical storm watch</a> was issued for <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a> early on <a href="/wiki/September_7" id="w">September 7</a> and later that day a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch superseded it. However the storm did not approach the island closely and the warnings were cancelled as the storm moved past the island on <a href="/wiki/September_8" id="w">September 8</a>.<sup id="_ref-NateTCR_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NateTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Canadian_Navy" id="w">Canadian Navy</a> ships headed to the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States" id="w">Gulf Coast of the United States</a>, carrying relief supplies to help in the aftermath of <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" id="w">Hurricane Katrina</a>, were slowed down trying to avoid Hurricanes Nate and <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Ophelia_(2005)" id="w">Ophelia</a>.<sup id="_ref-Times_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Times" title="">[5]</a></sup> The outer bands of Nate brushed Bermuda, with sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and less than 1 inch (25 mm) of rain recorded at <a href="/wiki/Bermuda_International_Airport" id="w">Bermuda International Airport</a>. There were no fatalities as a result of Hurricane Nate in Bermuda, and no damage was reported.<sup id="_ref-NateTCR_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NateTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Rip currents from Nate and the more distant <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Maria_(2005)" id="w">Maria</a> killed one and seriously injured another in <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a>. <sup id="_ref-natemaria_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-natemaria" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Naming_and_records" name="Naming_and_records"></a><h2>Naming and records</h2>
<p>When Tropical Storm Nate developed on <a href="/wiki/September_5" id="w">September 5</a>, it was the earliest ever in the season that the fourteenth named tropical storm developed, beating the previous record held by storm 14 of the <a href="/wiki/1936_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1936 season</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Due to the lack of any major effects from Hurricane Nate, the name was not retired by the <a href="/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization" id="w">World Meteorological Organization</a> and will be on the list of names for the 2011 season.</p>
