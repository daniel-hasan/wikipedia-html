The <b>Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority</b> <b>(MARTA)</b>, is the principal <a href="/wiki/Rapid_transit" id="w">rapid-transit</a> system in the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_metropolitan_area" id="w">Atlanta metropolitan area</a> and the ninth-largest in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>.  MARTA operates a network of <a href="/wiki/Bus_route" id="w">bus routes</a> linked to a <a href="/wiki/Heavy_rail" id="w">heavy rail</a> rapid transit system consisting of 48&#160;miles (77&#160;kilometers) of track with 38 <a href="/wiki/Train_station" id="w">train stations</a>.  As of 2006, the system has an average weekday ridership of 451,064 passengers.  The MARTA acronym is pronounced as a single word, not as individual letters.</p>
<p>MARTA is funded and operated by the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta%2C_Georgia" id="w">City of Atlanta</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fulton_County%2C_Georgia" id="w">Fulton County</a> and <a href="/wiki/DeKalb_County%2C_Georgia" id="w">DeKalb County</a>.  As a result the MARTA system only operates within the boundaries of Fulton County and DeKalb County, with additional limited bus service to <a href="/wiki/Cobb_County%2C_Georgia" id="w">Cobb County</a>.  </p>
<p>MARTA is the largest <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> transit agency not to receive <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">state</a> operational funding.  The other three largest counties in the metro Atlanta area, Cobb, <a href="/wiki/Gwinnett_County%2C_Georgia" id="w">Gwinnett</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Clayton_County%2C_Georgia" id="w">Clayton</a>, have refused to join or fund MARTA and as a result, all three have independent transit agencies which connect to MARTA.  The continued refusal of neighboring counties to participate and the lack of state funding for operation  has limited MARTA&#39;s ability to become a fully regional transportation system for Atlanta.{{fact}}  </p>

MARTA was originally proposed as a rapid transit agency for the five largest <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_metropolitan_area" id="w">metropolitan Atlanta</a> counties:  <a href="/wiki/DeKalb_County%2C_Georgia" id="w">DeKalb</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fulton_County%2C_Georgia" id="w">Fulton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Clayton_County%2C_Georgia" id="w">Clayton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gwinnett_County%2C_Georgia" id="w">Gwinnett</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cobb_County%2C_Georgia" id="w">Cobb</a> counties.  MARTA was formed by an act of the <a href="/wiki/Georgia_General_Assembly" id="w">Georgia General Assembly</a> in 1965. In the same year, four of the five metropolitan area counties (Clayton, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett) and the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta%2C_Georgia" id="w">City of Atlanta</a> passed a referendum authorizing participation in the system, but the referendum failed in Cobb County. Although a 1968 referendum to fund MARTA failed, in 1971, Fulton and DeKalb Counties successfully passed a 1% sales tax increase to pay for operations, while Clayton and Gwinnett counties overwhelmingly rejected the tax in referendum, fearing the introduction of crime and &#34;undesirable elements&#34;.<sup id="_ref-bullard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bullard" title="">[1]</a></sup>  In 1971, the agency agreed to purchase the existing, bus-only <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_Transit_Company" id="w">Atlanta Transit Company</a> and on <a href="/wiki/February_17" id="w">February 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1972" id="w">1972</a> the sale was completed for <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$12</a>.9 million giving the agency control over all public transit.</p>
<p>Construction began on the MARTA system in 1975, with the first rail service commencing on <a href="/wiki/June_30" id="w">June 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1979" id="w">1979</a>.  The system has since built most of the proposed rail lines, as well as stations in <a href="/wiki/Sandy_Springs_(MARTA_station)" id="w">Sandy Springs</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_Springs_(MARTA_station)" id="w">North Springs</a> which were not included in the original plan.

<p>For some time, MARTA had &#34;secret&#34; bus routes in the 700 series. These routes were designed to connect maids, home health care workers, and nannies from MARTA rail stations to their work sites. These routes were not officially noted in any system map except for a small footprint instructing people who needed transit service in that area to contact Customer Information.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> No schedules were publicly distributed, and no information was published on the web site.

<p>In compliance with the <a href="/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990" id="w">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>, MARTA provides <a href="/wiki/Paratransit" id="w">paratransit</a> for those persons defined as disabled by the ADA.  MARTA uses special lift equipped vehicles for this service and can either deliver passengers to their final destination (curb to curb service) or can deliver the passenger to the closest accessible bus stop or rail station (feeder service).  In fiscal year 2006 MARTA provided 289,258 paratransit trips.<sup id="_ref-06anrep_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-06anrep" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The average cost to MARTA for providing a one way trip for an individual paratransit passenger is <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$31</a>.88.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> This is much greater than the <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$3</a>.50 fare the paratransit rider is required to pay. The Americans with Disabilities Act forbids MARTA from charging a paratransit fare more than twice the normal fixed route fare.</p>
<p>Paratransit is limited to existing rail and bus routes and cannot extend more than a 0.75&#160;mile (1.2&#160;kilometer) radius from any existing route. Paratransit service is only provided during the hours of the fixed route servicing the area. An application for acceptance into the paratransit service is required; reservations are required for all users for each trip.</p>

MARTA has finished implementing the &#34;Breeze&#34; <a href="/wiki/Smart_card" id="w">smart card</a> electronic fare collection system in September 2006, replacing the previous <a href="/wiki/Token_coin" id="w">token</a>-based fare collection system.  The new Breeze Card allows riders to load money on the card for use over time, and to add weekly/monthly passes that are not fixed to a calendar period. The system uses a two card scheme: the <b>Limited-Use Ticket</b> is used by people who are visiting and other light users, and is composed of coated paper around the <a href="/wiki/Radio_Frequency_Identification" id="w">RFID</a> antenna. The <b>Extended-Use Card</b> is meant for those who use MARTA frequently and need to load time-based passes.  The new Breeze fare gates are designed to help prevent <a href="/wiki/Turnstile#Turnstile jumping" id="w">fare evasion</a>; with the older fare collection system fare evasion was much easier and was estimated to cost MARTA $10 million per year.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Other connecting transit systems such as <a href="/wiki/Georgia_Regional_Transportation_Authority" id="w">GRTA Xpress</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cobb_Community_Transit" id="w">CCT</a> have adopted the infrastructure, and are currently building implementation plans.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_1" id="w">May 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, MARTA began charging a $0.50 fee for issuing new Breeze Tickets.  Free Breeze Cards were available until <a href="/wiki/July_1" id="w">July 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, when a one-time $5 per card charge (Which includes two one-way trips) was implemented.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>MARTA stopped selling tokens after the Breeze conversion, but magnetic non-smart card weekly and monthly MARTA cards continue to be sold (until summer 2007). Tokens are no longer accepted as payment but can be transferred to a Breeze ticket, without incurring the $0.50 fee, at a Breeze ticketing machine.</p>
<a id="Hours_of_operation" name="Hours_of_operation"></a><h3>Hours of operation</h3>
<p>MARTA operates 365 days a year. Rail service is provided from approximately 5 a.m. to 1 a.m. Monday through Friday and 5 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. on weekends and holidays, and during certain events (<a href="/wiki/New_Year%26%2339%3Bs__Eve" id="w">New Year&#39;s  Eve</a>) trains run 24 hours.  Weekday train frequency is 10 minutes on branch lines and 5 minute frequencies on trunk lines. Late night (after 7:00 pm) and weekend frequency is reduced, with train frequencies of 15-20 minutes on all lines. Bus routes have varying frequencies depending on passenger demand.</p>
<a id="Fare_reciprocity" name="Fare_reciprocity"></a><h3>Fare reciprocity</h3>
<p>Through formal fare reciprocity agreements, MARTA riders are able to transfer for free to four other metro Atlanta transit systems:  <a href="/wiki/Gwinnett_County_Transit" id="w">Gwinnett County Transit</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cobb_Community_Transit" id="w">Cobb Community Transit</a>, <a href="/wiki/Clayton_County_C-TRAN" id="w">Clayton County C-TRAN</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Georgia_Regional_Transportation_Authority" id="w">GRTA Xpress</a>. Some of these agreements require that neither system have significantly more transfers than the other. MARTA has stated that this is the case, that inbound (to MARTA from another system) and outbound (from MARTA to another system) transfers are approximately equal (for second quarter 2006 8,888 daily passengers transferred inbound and 8,843 transferred outbound).<sup id="_ref-boardmin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boardmin" title="">[17]</a></sup> However, it has been noted that workers traveling in the morning to Atlanta from another system will more than likely make the return trip home, resulting in the appearance of an equal number of transfers. Analysis of morning transfers (5 to 9 am) to MARTA shows that Cobb County had 718 inbound transfers but only 528 outbound, Clayton county had 928 inbound but only 424 outbound, Gwinnett County had 239 inbound and 269 outbound, and GRTA Xpress had 1,175 inbound but 615 outbound.).<sup id="_ref-boardmin_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boardmin" title="">[17]</a></sup> These data suggest that more people from the other systems benefit from free transfers than those living in the MARTA service area.
