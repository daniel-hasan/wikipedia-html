<p><b><i>Eureka</i></b> (1848) is a lengthy <a href="/wiki/Non-fiction" id="w">non-fiction</a> work by American author <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe" id="w">Edgar Allan Poe</a> which he subtitled &#34;A <a href="/wiki/Prose_poetry" id="w">Prose Poem</a>,&#34; though it has also been subtitled as &#34;An <a href="/wiki/Essay" id="w">Essay</a> on the Material and Spiritual Universe.&#34; Adapted from a lecture he had presented, <i>Eureka</i> describes Poe&#39;s intuitive conception of the nature of the <a href="/wiki/Universe" id="w">universe</a> with no scientific work done to reach his conclusions. He also discusses man&#39;s relationship with <a href="/wiki/God" id="w">God</a>, who he compares to an author. It is dedicated to the German naturalist and explorer <a href="/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt" id="w">Alexander von Humboldt</a>.<sup id="_ref-Silverman339_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silverman339" title="">[1]</a></sup> Though it is generally considered unscientific, many of Poe&#39;s theories predate later accepted scientific theories including <a href="/wiki/Black_Hole" id="w">Black Holes</a>.<sup id="_ref-Blackholes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackholes" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Eureka</i> was received poorly in Poe&#39;s day and generally described as absurd, even by friends. Modern critics continue to debate the significance of <i>Eureka</i> and some doubt its seriousness, in part because of Poe&#39;s many incorrect assumptions and his comedic descriptions of well-known historical minds. Presented as a poem, many compare it with his fiction work, especially <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a> stories such as &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Facts_in_the_Case_of_M._Valdemar" id="w">The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar</a>.&#34; His attempts at discovering the truth also follow his own tradition of &#34;<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ratiocination">ratiocination</a>,&#34; a term used in his <a href="/wiki/Detective_fiction" id="w">detective fiction</a> tales. Poe&#39;s suggestion that the soul continues to thrive even after death also parallels with works in which characters reappear from beyond the grave such as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Ligeia" id="w">Ligeia</a>.&#34; The essay is oddly <a href="/wiki/Transcendentalism" id="w">Transcendental</a>, considering Poe&#39;s disdain for the movement. He considered it his greatest work and claimed it was more important than the discovery of <a href="/wiki/Gravity" id="w">gravity</a>.</p>
<a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>{{wikisourcepar}}</p>
<p><i>Eureka</i> is Poe&#39;s last major work and his longest non-fiction work at nearly 40,000 words in length.<sup id="_ref-Sova82_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sova82" title="">[3]</a></sup> The work has its origins in a lecture Poe presented on <a href="/wiki/February_3" id="w">February 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/1848" id="w">1848</a> titled &#34;On The Cosmography of the Universe&#34; at the Society Library in New York.<sup id="_ref-Quinn539_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Quinn539" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Sova82_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sova82" title="">[3]</a></sup> He had expected an audience of hundreds; only 60 attended and were confused by the topic.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Poe had hoped the profits from the lecture would cover expenses for the production of his new journal <i><a href="/wiki/The_Stylus" id="w">The Stylus</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Sova82_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sova82" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Eureka</i> is Poe&#39;s attempt at explaining the universe, using his general proposition &#34;Because Nothing was, therefore All Things are.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Sova83_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sova83" title="">[6]</a></sup> In it, Poe discusses man&#39;s relationship to God and the universe<sup id="_ref-Meyers214_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers214" title="">[7]</a></sup> or, as he offers at the beginning: &#34;I design to speak of the Physical, Metaphysical and Mathematical – of the Material and Spiritual Universe: of its Essence, its Origin, its Creation, its Present Condition and its Destiny.&#34;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> He says that matter and spirit are made of the same essence.<sup id="_ref-Hoffman245_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hoffman245" title="">[9]</a></sup> Poe suggests that people have a natural tendency to believe in themselves as infinite with nothing greater than their soul - such thoughts stem from man&#39;s residual feelings from when each shared an original identity with God.<sup id="_ref-Silverman340_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silverman340" title="">[10]</a></sup> Ultimately individual consciousnesses will collapse back into a similar single mass, a &#34;final ingathering&#34; where the &#34;myriads of individual Intelligences become blended.&#34;<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Likewise, Poe saw the universe itself as infinitely expanding and collapsing<sup id="_ref-Meyers215_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers215" title="">[12]</a></sup> like a divine heartbeat which constantly rejuvenates itself, also implying a sort of deathlessness.<sup id="_ref-Silverman339_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silverman339" title="">[1]</a></sup> In fact, because the soul is a part of this constant throbbing, after dying, all people, in essence, become God.<sup id="_ref-Silverman340_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silverman340" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Analysis" name="Analysis"></a><h2>Analysis</h2>
<p><i>Eureka</i> presents similar themes and sentiments as some of Poe&#39;s fiction work, including attempts at breaking beyond the obstacle of death<sup id="_ref-Sova83_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sova83" title="">[6]</a></sup> and specifically characters who return from death in stories like &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Usher" id="w">The Fall of the House of Usher</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Ligeia" id="w">Ligeia</a>.&#34; Similar to his theories on a good <a href="/wiki/Short_story" id="w">short story</a>, Poe believes the universe is a self-contained, closed system.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> In coming to his conclusions, Poe, in effect, is utilizing his literary device of &#34;ratiocination,&#34; perfected by his character <a href="/wiki/C._Auguste_Dupin" id="w">C. Auguste Dupin</a>, as if he was himself a detective charged with solving the mystery of the universe.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> <i>Eureka</i>, then, is the culmination of Poe&#39;s interest in capturing truth through language, an extension of his interest in <a href="/wiki/Cryptography" id="w">cryptography</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Eureka</i> seems to continue the <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a> traditions he used in works like &#34;<a href="/wiki/MS._Found_in_a_Bottle" id="w">MS. Found in a Bottle</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Facts_in_the_Case_of_M._Valdemar" id="w">The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Meyers214_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers214" title="">[7]</a></sup> He further emphasizes the connection between his theory and fiction by saying that the universe itself is a written work: &#34;The Universe is a plot of God,&#34; Poe says, <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> and &#34;the plots of God are perfect.&#34;<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Even so, Poe admits the difficulty in explaining these theories comes in part from the limitations of language, often apologizing for or explaining his use of &#34;common&#34; or &#34;vulgar&#34; terms.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Poe&#39;s decision to refer to the piece as a &#34;prose poem&#34; goes against some of his own &#34;rules&#34; of poetry which he laid out in &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Philosophy_of_Composition" id="w">The Philosophy of Composition</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Poetic_Principle" id="w">The Poetic Principle</a>&#34;. In particular, Poe called the ideal poem short, at most 100 lines, and utilizing the &#34;most poetical topic in the world&#34;: the death of a beautiful woman.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> The work also ventures into <a href="/wiki/Transcendentalism" id="w">Transcendentalism</a>, relying strongly on <a href="/wiki/Intuition_(knowledge)" id="w">intuition</a>, a movement and practice he had despised.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Despite his criticism of that movement&#39;s incoherent mysticism, <i>Eureka</i> is more mystical than most Transcendental works.<sup id="_ref-Meyers214_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers214" title="">[7]</a></sup> Poe himself suggested that the work be judged only as a work of art, not of science, possibly dismissing the seriousness of <i>Eureka</i>.<sup id="_ref-Meyers215_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers215" title="">[12]</a></sup> Though he is using mathematical and scientific terms, he may really be talking about <a href="/wiki/Aesthetics" id="w">aesthetics</a><sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> and suggesting there is a close connection between science and art.<sup id="_ref-PeterPage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PeterPage" title="">[22]</a></sup> This is an ironic sentiment when compared to his message in the poem &#34;<a href="/wiki/To_Science" id="w">To Science</a>&#34; where he shows a distaste for modern science encroaching on spirituality and the artist&#39;s imagination.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>The essay is written in a progressive manner that anticipates its audience. For example, Poe uses more metaphors further into the work in the belief that the reader becomes more interested.<sup id="_ref-Golding4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Golding4" title="">[24]</a></sup> Poe&#39;s voice <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Crescendo">crescendos</a> throughout, starting as the modest seeker of truth, moving on to the satirist of logic, and finally ending as the master scholar.<sup id="_ref-Golding4_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Golding4" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

<li>&#34;<a href="/wiki/Eureka_(word)" id="w">Eureka</a>&#34; - The title itself references the famed remark made by <a href="/wiki/Archimedes" id="w">Archimedes</a>, meaning, &#34;I have found it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Silverman338_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silverman338" title="">[25]</a></sup> Archimedes used the term after taking a bath and discovering the concept of <a href="/wiki/Displacement_(fluid)" id="w">displacement</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Epicurus" id="w">Epicurus</a> - Poe refers to the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek_philosophy" id="w">Ancient Greek philosopher</a> with the term &#34;Epicurean <a href="/wiki/Atom" id="w">atoms</a>.&#34; Epicurus believed that <a href="/wiki/Atomism" id="w">atoms are attracted to one another in space</a>. It has been suggested that Poe&#39;s exultation of the &#34;false scientist&#34; Epicurus is an indication that <i>Eureka</i> is really a <a href="/wiki/Satire" id="w">satire</a>.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></li>

<p>The comical presentation of these well-known historical theorists, including the <a href="/wiki/Pun" id="w">puns</a> on their names, suggests Poe intended <i>Eureka</i> to be a <a href="/wiki/Burlesque" id="w">burlesque</a>.<sup id="_ref-Meyers215_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers215" title="">[12]</a></sup> Alternatively, his criticism of these men indicate Poe&#39;s need to challenge their conclusions before making his own.<sup id="_ref-Silverman339_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silverman339" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Influence_and_significance" name="Influence_and_significance"></a><h2>Influence and significance</h2>
<p><i>Eureka</i> has been read in many ways, in part because Poe&#39;s sincerity in the work is questionable. It has been considered prophetically scientific, intuitively <a href="/wiki/Romanticism" id="w">Romantic</a>, and even calculatingly ironic.<sup id="_ref-PeterPage_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PeterPage" title="">[22]</a></sup> Lacking scientific proof, Poe said it was not his goal to prove what he says to be true, but to convince through suggestion.<sup id="_ref-Meyers215_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers215" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though modern critics have dismissed <i>Eureka</i> for having no scientific worth or merit,<sup id="_ref-Meyers214_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers214" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Poe&#39;s work <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Presage">presages</a> modern science with his own concept of the <a href="/wiki/Big_Bang" id="w">Big Bang</a>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> He postulated that the universe began from a single originating particle or <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_singularity" id="w">singularity</a>, willed by a &#34;Divine Volition.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Silverman339_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silverman339" title="">[1]</a></sup> This &#34;primordial particle,&#34; initiated by God,<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>  divides into all the particles of the universe. These particles seek one another because of their originating unity (gravity) resulting in the end of the universe as a single particle. Poe also expresses a cosmological theory that anticipated <a href="/wiki/Black_holes" id="w">black holes</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Big_Crunch" id="w">Big Crunch</a> theory<sup id="_ref-Blackholes_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackholes" title="">[2]</a></sup> as well as the first plausible solution to <a href="/wiki/Olbers%26%2339%3B_paradox" id="w">Olbers&#39; paradox</a>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Many of Poe&#39;s conclusions, however, are speculative due to his rejection of analytic logic and emphasis on intuition and inspiration.<sup id="_ref-Meyers214_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers214" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p><i>Eureka</i> is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe&#39;s suggestions opposed <a href="/wiki/Newton%26%2339%3Bs_laws_of_motion" id="w">Newtonian principles</a> regarding the density and rotation of planets.<sup id="_ref-Sova83_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sova83" title="">[6]</a></sup> He also incorrectly says that <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Kepler" id="w">Johannes Kepler</a> came to his conclusions not through science but through guesswork.<sup id="_ref-Meyers214_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers214" title="">[7]</a></sup> For this reason, it has been suggested that what Poe demands is true in <i>Eureka</i> is not actually about this universe, but a parallel fictitious one Poe creates.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> If this is the case, Poe is criticizing this world, suggesting it has fallen away from God by elevating scientific reason above poetic intuition, as suggested by poet <a href="/wiki/Richard_Wilbur" id="w">Richard Wilbur</a>.<sup id="_ref-Meyers216_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers216" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>More modern critics also suggest <i>Eureka</i> is a sign of Poe&#39;s declining mental health at the end of his life.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> In the text, Poe wrote that he was aware he might be considered a madman.<sup id="_ref-Meyers215_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers215" title="">[12]</a></sup> The lecture on which the essay was based was delivered only a few days after the anniversary of the death of his wife <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Eliza_Clemm_Poe" id="w">Virginia</a>, suggesting a connection between the event and his new theories.<sup id="_ref-Silverman339_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silverman339" title="">[1]</a></sup> Poe seems to dismiss death in <i>Eureka</i>, thereby ignoring his own anxiety over the problem of death.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Some modern critics also believe that <i>Eureka</i> is the key to deciphering meaning in all of Poe&#39;s fiction, as if all his works involve similar theories.<sup id="_ref-Hoffman274_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hoffman274" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Critical_reception" name="Critical_reception"></a><h2>Critical reception</h2>
<p>Response to <i>Eureka</i> was overwhelmingly unfavorable. Poe&#39;s friend Marie Louise Shew, who had helped his wife <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Eliza_Clemm_Poe" id="w">Virginia</a> on her death-bed, broke off their friendship because it offended her religious beliefs.<sup id="_ref-Silverman340_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silverman340" title="">[10]</a></sup> After its publication, a vehement anonymous censure was published in the <i>Literary Review</i>. This was believed by Poe to have been written by John Henry Hopkins, Jr. (1820-1889), a young theological student, who had previously criticized the work as <a href="/wiki/Pantheistic" id="w">pantheistic</a> and &#34;a damnable heresy&#34; that &#34;conscience would compel him to denounce.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Silverman341_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silverman341" title="">[36]</a></sup> Literary critic <a href="/wiki/George_Edward_Woodberry" id="w">George Edward Woodberry</a> in 1885 thought the essay was based on a crude understanding of the science a student learns in school &#34;rendered ridiculous&#34; by absurdity and the density of his ignorance.<sup id="_ref-Meyers217_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers217" title="">[37]</a></sup> The lecture upon which <i>Eureka</i> was based also received negative reviews. Poe&#39;s friend <a href="/wiki/Evert_Duyckinck" id="w">Evert Duyckinck</a> wrote to his brother that the lecture bored him to death and that it was &#34;full of a ludicrous dryness of scientific phrase - a mountainous piece of absurdity.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Sova82_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sova82" title="">[3]</a></sup> A local newspaper called it &#34;hyperbolic nonsense.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Meyers218_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers218" title="">[38]</a></sup> though one publication, the <i>Courier and Enquirer</i>, called it &#34;a nobler effort than any other Mr. Poe has yet given the world.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Quinn539_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Quinn539" title="">[4]</a></sup> Audience members said it was not persuasive or simply too long.<sup id="_ref-Silverman338_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silverman338" title="">[25]</a></sup> Even so, Poe considered <i>Eureka</i> to be his masterpiece.<sup id="_ref-Meyers219_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers219" title="">[39]</a></sup> He believed the work would immortalize him because it would be proven to be true.<sup id="_ref-Silverman339_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silverman339" title="">[1]</a></sup> In the <a href="/wiki/Preface" id="w">Preface</a>, Poe said: &#34;It is as a Poem only that I wish this work to be judged after I am dead.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Sova82_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sova82" title="">[3]</a></sup> After its publication he wrote to his aunt Maria Clemm saying, &#34;I have no desire to live since I have done <i>Eureka</i>. I could accomplish nothing more.&#34;<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> He confided in a friend that he believed his contemporary generation was unable to understand it but that it would be appreciated, if ever, two thousand years later.<sup id="_ref-Silverman338_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silverman338" title="">[25]</a></sup> Some critics, however, respond favorably to <i>Eureka</i>. French writer <a href="/wiki/Paul_Val%C3%A9ry" id="w">Paul Valéry</a> praised it for both its poetic and scientific merit, calling it an <a href="/wiki/Abstract_art" id="w">abstract</a> poem based on mathematical foundations.<sup id="_ref-Meyers216_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meyers216" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
