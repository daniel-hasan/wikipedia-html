The <b>meteorological history of <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Wilma" id="w">Hurricane Wilma</a></b>, the most intense known <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">tropical cyclone</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Western_Hemisphere" id="w">Western Hemisphere</a>, began in the second week of October 2005. A large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a> and gradually organized to the southeast of <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" id="w">Jamaica</a>. By late on <a href="/wiki/October_15" id="w">October 15</a>, the system was sufficiently organized for the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> to designate it as <a href="/wiki/Tropical_depression" id="w">Tropical Depression</a> Twenty-Four.</p>
<p>The depression drifted southwestward, and under favorable conditions, it <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis" id="w">strengthened</a> into <a href="/wiki/Tropical_Storm" id="w">Tropical Storm</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Wilma" id="w">Wilma</a></i> on <a href="/wiki/October_17" id="w">October 17</a>. Initially, development was slow due to its large size, though <a href="/wiki/Convection#Atmospheric convection" id="w">convection</a> steadily organized. From <a href="/wiki/October_18" id="w">October 18</a>, and through the following day, Wilma underwent <a href="/wiki/Rapid_deepening" id="w">explosive deepening</a> over the open waters of the Caribbean; in a 30-hour period, the system&#39;s central <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure" id="w">atmospheric pressure</a> dropped from 982&#160;<a href="/wiki/Bar_(unit)" id="w">mbar</a> (29.00&#160;<a href="/wiki/Inch_of_mercury" id="w">inHg</a>) to the record-low value of 882&#160;mbar (26.05&#160;inHg), while the winds increased to 185&#160;mph (300&#160;km/h). At its peak intensity, the <a href="/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)" id="w">pinhole eye</a> of Wilma was about 3&#160;miles (5&#160;km) in diameter, the smallest known eye in an <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane" id="w">Atlantic hurricane</a>. After the inner eye dissipated due to an <a href="/wiki/Eyewall_replacement_cycle" id="w">eyewall replacement cycle</a>, Wilma weakened to <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 4 status</a>, and on <a href="/wiki/October_21" id="w">October 21</a>, it made <a href="/wiki/Landfall_(meteorology)" id="w">landfall</a> on <a href="/wiki/Cozumel" id="w">Cozumel</a> and on the <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexican mainland</a> with winds of about 150&#160;mph (240&#160;km/h).</p>
<p>Wilma weakened over the <a href="/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula" id="w">Yucatán Peninsula</a>, and reached the southern <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf of Mexico</a> before accelerating northeastward. Despite increasing amounts of <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a>, the hurricane re-strengthened to hit <a href="/wiki/Cape_Romano" id="w">Cape Romano</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a> as a major hurricane. Wilma weakened as it quickly crossed the state, and entered the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> near <a href="/wiki/Jupiter%2C_Florida" id="w">Jupiter, Florida</a>. The hurricane again re-intensified before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection. On <a href="/wiki/October_26" id="w">October 26</a>, it transitioned into an <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" id="w">extratropical cyclone</a>, and the next day, the remnants of Wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Canada" id="w">Atlantic Canada</a>.</p>

The origin of Hurricane Wilma is complicated. During the second week of October, an unusually large, <a href="/wiki/Monsoon_trough" id="w">monsoon</a>-like lower-level circulation and a broad area of disturbed weather developed over much of the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a>. The system was enhanced by <a href="/wiki/Diffluence" id="w">diffluence</a>—the rate at which a fluid moves—from an upper-level low across the southwestern Atlantic.<sup id="_ref-tcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> By <a href="/wiki/October_13" id="w">October 13</a>, a broad <a href="/wiki/Low_pressure_area" id="w">area of low pressure</a> developed and persisted about 150&#160;miles (240&#160;km) southeast of <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" id="w">Jamaica</a>,<sup id="_ref-1013two_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1013two" title="">[2]</a></sup> possibly aided by the passage of <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical waves</a> through the area at the time.<sup id="_ref-tcr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Convection" id="w">Convection</a> increased and became slightly better organized, though upper-level wind shear initially prevented <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis" id="w">development</a>. The system drifted westward,<sup id="_ref-1013two_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1013two" title="">[2]</a></sup> and early on <a href="/wiki/October_14" id="w">October 14</a> the convection became more concentrated and a little better organized as upper-level wind shear lessened slightly.<sup id="_ref-1014two_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1014two" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Later on <a href="/wiki/October_14" id="w">October 14</a>, the system became much better defined, with increasingly organized shower and thunderstorm activity, as conditions in the upper levels of the atmosphere became significantly more favorable. It was then that the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> first indicated that it was possible for a tropical depression to develop in the area.<sup id="_ref-1014two2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1014two2" title="">[4]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Dvorak_technique" id="w">Dvorak classifications</a> were initiated on <a href="/wiki/October_15" id="w">October 15</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> The system continued to organize, with the National Hurricane Center remarking the system could ultimately become a hurricane.<sup id="_ref-1015two_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1015two" title="">[5]</a></sup> By late on <a href="/wiki/October_15" id="w">October 15</a>, the surface circulation became defined well-enough, with sufficiently organized deep convection, for the National Hurricane Center to designate the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while it was located about 220&#160;miles (345&#160;km) east-southeast of <a href="/wiki/Grand_Cayman" id="w">Grand Cayman</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The depression tracked slowly westward, a motion due to weak steering currents caused by a <a href="/wiki/Ridge_(meteorology)" id="w">high pressure system</a> to its north across the Gulf of Mexico. Initially, the center of circulation was broad without a defined inner core; forecaster <a href="/wiki/Lixion_Avila" id="w">Lixion Avila</a> remarked, &#34;The area of minimum pressure could [have been] anywhere within 60&#160;miles (95&#160;km) of its [initial advisory position].&#34; Initially, the tropical depression was forecast to drift west-southwestward before turning to the north; within 120&#160;hours of the forecast&#39;s issuance, the system was predicted to be located about 80&#160;miles (130&#160;km) south of the <a href="/wiki/Isle_of_Youth" id="w">Isle of Youth</a> as a 105&#160;mph (170&#160;km/h) hurricane. However, the National Hurricane Center noted in the first advisory on the depression that there were &#34;all indications that there could a dangerous hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean Sea in 3 to 5 days.&#34; This was due to the depression being located within an environment very conducive for <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis" id="w">development</a>, specifically low amounts of wind shear and very warm <a href="/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature" id="w">water temperatures</a>.<sup id="_ref-disc1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc1" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>As Tropical Depression Twenty-Four drifted southwestward, it steadily organized; by early on <a href="/wiki/October_16" id="w">October 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Physical structure" id="w">rainbands</a> began to gradually consolidate with well-established <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Physical structure" id="w">outflow</a>, and a large upper-level <a href="/wiki/Anticyclone" id="w">anticyclone</a> developed over the depression.<sup id="_ref-disc2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc2" title="">[7]</a></sup> Although deep convection and <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Physical structure" id="w">banding features</a> increased, mid-level dry air from the north prevented significant organization, and the convection was split into two primary areas. <a href="/wiki/Weather_buoy" id="w">Surface buoy</a> reports indicated that, due to its large size, the system failed to strengthen beyond tropical depression status, even though it received <a href="/wiki/Tropical_storm" id="w">tropical storm</a> strength <a href="/wiki/Dvorak_technique" id="w">Dvorak classifications</a> from The National Hurricane Center&#39;s Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch and the <a href="/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration" id="w">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>&#39;s Satellite Analysis Branch.<sup id="_ref-disc3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc3" title="">[8]</a></sup> Continued <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Hunters" id="w">reconnaissance flights</a> reported peak winds of about 30&#160;mph (50&#160;km/h).<sup id="_ref-disc5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc5" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>By early on <a href="/wiki/October_17" id="w">October 17</a>, the outer rainbands, which had previously dominated the structure of the cyclone, dissipated, while deep convection developed near and to the south of the center. <a href="/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction" id="w">Computer models</a> predicted steady strengthening as the depression tracked westward before turning to the north. Of the intensity models, the <a href="/wiki/Geophysical_Fluid_Dynamics_Laboratory" id="w">Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory</a> predicted an intensity of 135&#160;mph (215&#160;km/h) within 36&#160;hours, with other forecasts being more conservative in their predictions.<sup id="_ref-disc6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc6" title="">[10]</a></sup> Deep convection continued to develop to the south of the center, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Wilma at 0600&#160;UTC on <a href="/wiki/October_17" id="w">October 17</a>, while located about 200&#160;miles (320&#160;km) southeast of Grand Cayman. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center predicted Wilma to track west-northwestward, reaching winds of 105&#160;mph (170&#160;km/h) before striking the northeastern portion of the <a href="/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula" id="w">Yucatán Peninsula</a>.<sup id="_ref-wilmadisc7_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wilmadisc7" title="">[11]</a></sup> The storm continued to the southwest while deep convection persisted near the center.

This was due to unusually low pressures across the region, which resulted in a lesser <a href="/wiki/Pressure_gradient" id="w">pressure gradient</a> and thus lighter winds. Convection continued to develop near the center and became much more symmetrical.<sup id="_ref-disc9_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc9" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

Shortly after exiting the Florida coastline, Wilma began to re-intensify,<sup id="_ref-tcr_r" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> believed to be due to a reduction of friction of the eyewall and warm waters of the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Stream" id="w">Gulf Stream</a>.<sup id="_ref-disc38_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc38" title="">[29]</a></sup> Early on <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a>, the hurricane reached a secondary peak intensity of 125 mph while located about 340&#160;miles (545&#160;km) east of <a href="/wiki/Jacksonville%2C_Florida" id="w">Jacksonville, Florida</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_s" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> During the time, the large circulation of Wilma absorbed smaller <a href="/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Alpha_(2005)" id="w">Tropical Depression Alpha</a> over the <a href="/wiki/Bahamas" id="w">Bahamas</a>.<sup id="_ref-alpha_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-alpha" title="">[30]</a></sup> Shortly thereafter, the wind shear combined with its rapid forward motion of 50&#160;mph (80&#160;km/h) resulted in a steady weakening trend.<sup id="_ref-tcr_t" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> The overall cloud pattern began to deteriorate, with the eye becoming less distinct and the convection less symmetric.<sup id="_ref-disc41_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc41" title="">[31]</a></sup> By 1170&#160;UTC on <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a>, the center was located to the northwest of the primary convection as cold air from the southwest entrained the circulation.<sup id="_ref-disc42_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc42" title="">[32]</a></sup> The remaining convection continued to diminish, and early on <a href="/wiki/October_26" id="w">October 26</a> Wilma transitioned into an <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" id="w">extratropical cyclone</a> while located about 230&#160;miles (370&#160;km) southeast of <a href="/wiki/Halifax_Regional_Municipality" id="w">Halifax</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nova_Scotia" id="w">Nova Scotia</a>.
