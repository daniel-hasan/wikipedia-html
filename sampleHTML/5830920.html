<a id="Accident_sequence" name="Accident_sequence"></a><h2>Accident sequence</h2>
<p>At about 2:55 PM, the four-engine <a href="/wiki/Lockheed_Electra" id="w">Lockheed Electra L-188A</a> <a href="/wiki/Turboprop" id="w">turboprop</a> began its <a href="/wiki/Takeoff" id="w">takeoff</a> run to the west. At some point during the takeoff run or initial climb, the number three engine failed and caught fire. The crew continued the takeoff and climb, per standard procedure, using power from the remaining three engines. The pilot radioed the <a href="/wiki/Control_tower" id="w">control tower</a> declaring an emergency, and the control tower cleared the flight for an immediate landing.<sup id="_ref-nyt10_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nyt10" title="">[5]</a></sup> The number three engine was engulfed in flames as the crew retracted the <a href="/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)" id="w">flaps</a> and maneuvered the plane into a left turn back to the runway.<sup id="_ref-snet_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-snet" title="">[1]</a></sup> The plane entered a 30-45 degree bank, then rapidly lost altitude and crashed into hilly terrain about 1.5 miles west-southwest of the runway, above the village of San Gerónimo.<sup id="_ref-map_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-map" title="">[12]</a></sup>
All aboard perished except the copilot, who was badly burned but survived. Two farmers were killed on the ground. </p>
<a id="Investigation" name="Investigation"></a><h2>Investigation</h2>
<p>The Peruvian government investigated the accident, and in its final report concluded that the probable cause of the accident was the improper execution of engine-out procedures by the flight crew, with contributing factors of improper loading of the aircraft and improper maintenance procedures by company personnel. There was also evidence of a coverup and falsification of critical maintenance records by LANSA employees during the investigation process. The Peruvian government subsequently fined LANSA and some of its employees, and suspended the airline&#39;s operating license for 90 days as a consequence.<sup id="_ref-site_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-site" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
