<p><a href="/wiki/STS-51-D" id="w">STS-51-D</a> Discovery (April 12-19, 1985) was launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the mission, the crew deployed ANIK-C for Telesat of <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, and Syncom IV-3 for the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Navy" id="w">U.S. Navy</a>. A malfunction in the Syncom spacecraft resulted in the first unscheduled EVA, rendezvous and proximity operations for the Space Shuttle in an attempt to activate the satellite. Additional, the crew also conducted several medical experiments, two student experiments, activated two Getaway Specials, and filmed experiments with toys in space. The mission was accomplished in 109 orbits of the Earth in 167 hours, 54 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/STS-34" id="w">STS-34</a> Atlantis (October 18-23, 1989) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida and returned to land at <a href="/wiki/Edwards_Air_Force_Base" id="w">Edwards Air Force Base</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>. During the mission the crew successfully deployed the Galileo spacecraft, starting its journey to explore Jupiter, operated the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SSBUV) to map atmospheric ozone, and performed numerous secondary experiments involving radiation measurements, polymer morphology, lightning research, microgravity effects on plants, and a student experiment on ice crystal growth in space. The mission was accomplished in 79 orbits of the Earth in 119 hours, 41 minutes.</p>
