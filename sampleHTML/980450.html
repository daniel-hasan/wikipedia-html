<p>The <b>United States national cricket team</b> is the team that represents the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" id="w">United States of America</a> in international <a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">cricket</a> matches. The team became an associate member of the <a href="/wiki/International_Cricket_Council" id="w">International Cricket Council</a> in 1965, although the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America_Cricket_Association" id="w">United States of America Cricket Association</a> is currently suspended by the ICC.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>{{main}}
</p><a id="Beginnings" name="Beginnings"></a><h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">Cricket</a> was first played in the United States in the eighteenth century.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> It is understood from anecdotal evidence that <a href="/wiki/George_Washington" id="w">George Washington</a> was a strong supporter of cricket, participating at least one occasion in games of cricket with his troops at <a href="/wiki/Valley_Forge" id="w">Valley Forge</a> during the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution" id="w">American Revolution</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/John_Adams" id="w">John Adams</a> was recorded as saying in <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_the_United_States" id="w">Congress</a> that if leaders of cricket clubs could be called &#34;presidents&#34;, there was no reason why the leader of the new nation could not be called the same.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1844, the United States was a player in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_v_Canada_(1844)" id="w">first international cricket match</a>. This was played against <a href="/wiki/Canada_cricket_team" id="w">Canada</a> at the <a href="/wiki/St_George%26%2339%3Bs_Cricket_Club" id="w">St George&#39;s Cricket Club</a> Ground, <a href="/wiki/Bloomingdale_Park" id="w">Bloomingdale Park</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>.<sup id="_ref-CricInfoArticle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CricInfoArticle" title="">[4]</a></sup> This first international sporting event was attended by 20,000 people and established the longest international sporting rivalry in the modern era.<sup id="_ref-CricClub_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CricClub" title="">[5]</a></sup> Wagers of around $120,000 were placed on the outcome of the match. This is equivalent to around $1.5 million in 2007.<sup id="_ref-Canada Cricket_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Canada Cricket" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sides from England toured North America (taking in both the USA and Canada) following the English cricket seasons of 1859, 1868 and 1872. These were organised as purely commercial ventures. Most of the matches of these early touring teams were played &#34;against odds&#34;, that is to say the home team was permitted to have more than eleven players (usually twenty-two) in order to make a more even contest.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Decline" name="Decline"></a><h3> Decline </h3>
<p>In spite of cricket&#39;s popularity in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the game was supplanted by <a href="/wiki/Baseball" id="w">baseball</a> in the 1850s and 1860s. As interest in baseball rose, the rules of that game were changed slightly to increase its popularity. For example, easily manufactured round <a href="/wiki/Baseball_bat" id="w">bats</a> were introduced to contrast the flat <a href="/wiki/Cricket_bat" id="w">bats</a> of cricket.<sup id="_ref-Seattle Cricket_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seattle Cricket" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another reason cricket&#39;s decline in popularity may be that in the late 1800s American cricket remained an amateur sport reserved for the wealthy while England and Australia were developing a <a href="/wiki/Professional_sport" id="w">professional</a> version of the game. As cricket standards improved with professionalism elsewhere in the world many North American cricket clubs stayed stubbornly elitist. Clubs such as <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Cricket_Club" id="w">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Merion_Cricket_Club" id="w">Merion</a> abandoned cricket and converted their facilities to other sports. Some city cricket clubs unknowingly contributed to their own demise by sponsoring auxiliary baseball teams.{{Fact}} By 1900 baseball had taken over the American scene and created its independent mythology.{{Fact}} The formation of the <i>Imperial Cricket Conference</i> in 1909 also helped to keep the popularity of the game down. It certainly undercut any momentum to professionalize cricket in the USA, although whether the momentum would have developed even in the presence of a more open ICC remains a question.<sup id="_ref-CricInfoArticle_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CricInfoArticle" title="">[4]</a></sup> Regardless of its cause, the game did not flourish in the United States the way it did in the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British Empire</a>. From the 1880s until the outbreak of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, the American game was dominated not by the national side, but by an amateur team from <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" id="w">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a>.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The <a href="/wiki/Philadelphian_cricket_team" id="w">Philadelphian cricket team</a>, shown here on an 1884 tour of England, were the premier American cricket team for several decades after the US Civil War</div>
The Philadelphian cricket team was a team that represented <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" id="w">Philadelphia</a> in <a href="/wiki/First-class_cricket" id="w">first-class cricket</a> between 1878 and 1913. Even though the United States had played the first ever international <a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">cricket</a> match against <a href="/wiki/Canada_cricket_team" id="w">Canada</a> in 1844, the sport began a slow decline in the country.<sup id="_ref-CricinfoArticle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CricinfoArticle" title="">[9]</a></sup> This decline was furthered by the rise in popularity of baseball. In Philadelphia, however, the sport remained very popular and from the end of the 19th century until the outbreak of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, the city produced a first class team that rivaled many others in the world. The team was composed of players from the four chief cricket clubs in Philadelphia&#8211;<a href="/wiki/Germantown_Cricket_Club" id="w">Germantown</a>, <a href="/wiki/Merion_Cricket_Club" id="w">Merion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belmont_Cricket_Club" id="w">Belmont</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Cricket_Club" id="w">Philadelphia</a>. Players from smaller clubs, such as <a href="/wiki/Tioga_Cricket_Club" id="w">Tioga</a> and <a href="/wiki/Moorestown_Cricket_Club" id="w">Moorestown</a>, and local colleges, such as <a href="/wiki/Haverford_College" id="w">Haverford</a> and <a href="/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania" id="w">Penn</a>, also played for the Philadelphians. Over its 35 years, the team played in 89 first-class cricket matches. Of those, 29 were won, 46 were lost, 13 were drawn and one game was abandoned before completion.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Arguably, the greatest American cricketer ever played for Philadelphia during this period. <a href="/wiki/John_Barton_King" id="w">John Barton King</a> was a very skilled batsman, but really proved his worth as a bowler. During his career, he set numerous records in North America and at least one <a href="/wiki/First-class_cricket" id="w">first-class</a> bowling record.<sup id="_ref-Rolfe_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rolfe" title="">[11]</a></sup> He competed with and succeeded against the best cricketers in the world from England and Australia. King was the dominant bowler on his team when it toured England in 1897, 1903, and 1908. He dismissed batsmen with his unique delivery, which he called &#34;the angler&#34;, and helped to perfect swing bowling in the sport. Many of the great bowlers of today still use the strategies and techniques that he developed.<sup id="_ref-SABRUK_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SABRUK" title="">[12]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Plum_Warner" id="w">Sir Pelham Warner</a> described Bart King as one of the finest bowlers of all time,<sup id="_ref-WisObit_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WisObit" title="">[13]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Donald_Bradman" id="w">Donald Bradman</a> called him &#34;America&#39;s greatest cricketing son.&#34;<sup id="_ref-TheDon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TheDon" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/28_June" id="w">28 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1913" id="w">1913</a> the Philadelphians played the last first-class game on the mainland for more than 90 years. Games were played in the <a href="/wiki/US_Virgin_Islands" id="w">US Virgin Islands</a> in the interim, which is considered as part of the West Indies by the ICC. The team had played an American national side 6 times between 1885 and 1894. The United States team won one of these matches, lost two, and earned a draw in three. Cricket remained a minor pastime in the United States until the mid-1960s, when ICC reforms allowed associate members to join.</p>
<a id="Status_from_1965" name="Status_from_1965"></a><h2>Status from 1965</h2>
<p>In 1965, the Imperial Cricket Conference changed its name to the International Cricket Conference. In addition, new rules were adopted to permit the election of countries from outside the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth</a>. This led to the expansion of the Conference, with the admission of Associate Members, including the United States. A more sustained resurgence in popularity was seen in the 1970s as immigrants from the <a href="/wiki/West_Indies" id="w">West Indies</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Indian_subcontinent" id="w">Indian subcontinent</a> played the sport.{{Fact}} Today cricket is played in all fifty states.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2004, the United States cricket team played a first-class match as part of the first <a href="/wiki/ICC_Intercontinental_Cup" id="w">ICC Intercontinental Cup</a>. The matches against <a href="/wiki/Canadian_cricket_team" id="w">Canada</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bermudan_cricket_team" id="w">Bermuda</a> were the first in many years. The team won the <a href="/wiki/ICC_6_Nations_Challenge" id="w">ICC 6 Nations Challenge</a> beating <a href="/wiki/Scottish_cricket_team" id="w">Scotland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Namibian_cricket_team" id="w">Namibia</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_cricket_team" id="w">Netherlands</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates_cricket_team" id="w">UAE</a> on net run rate by 0.028 of a run.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Winning the ICC Six Nations meant that they qualified for the <a href="/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy_2004" id="w">ICC Champions Trophy 2004</a> in England. Here the USA played their first ever <a href="/wiki/One_Day_International" id="w">One Day International</a> match against <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team" id="w">New Zealand</a> at <a href="/wiki/The_Oval" id="w">The Oval</a> on <a href="/wiki/10_September" id="w">10 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The US side was beaten by New Zealand and lost to <a href="/wiki/Australian_cricket_team" id="w">Australia</a> in the tournament, as well. <sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/2005_ICC_Trophy" id="w">2005 ICC Trophy</a> represented a chance for the USA to re-establish themselves on the world stage and qualify for the <a href="/wiki/2007_cricket_World_Cup" id="w">2007 World Cup</a>. A poor showing saw them finish at the bottom of their group, with four losses and a match abandoned due to rain from their five group fixtures. This failure robbed the USA of the prize of full <a href="/wiki/One_Day_International" id="w">One Day International</a> status on offer to the World Cup qualifiers. This failure was compounded on <a href="/wiki/August_9" id="w">August 9</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> when the ICC expelled the USA from the <a href="/wiki/2005_ICC_Intercontinental_Cup" id="w">2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup</a>. <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The USA made their return to international cricket in August 2006 when they participated in Division One of the <a href="/wiki/ICC_Americas_Championship" id="w">ICC Americas Championship</a> in <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> They finished second in the five team tournament.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
