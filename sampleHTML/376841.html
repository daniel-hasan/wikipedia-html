{{Warsaw Uprising}}
The <b>Warsaw Uprising</b> (<i>Powstanie Warszawskie</i>) was a <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> struggle by the <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Polish</a> <a href="/wiki/Armia_Krajowa" id="w">Home Army</a> (<i>Armia Krajowa</i>) to liberate <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" id="w">Warsaw</a> from <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> occupation. The Uprising began on <a href="/wiki/August_1" id="w">August 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>, as part of a nationwide rebellion, <a href="/wiki/Operation_Tempest" id="w">Operation Tempest</a>. It was intended to last for only a few days until the Soviet Army would reach the city. The Soviet advance stopped short, however, while Polish resistance against the German forces continued for 63 days (until October 2).</p>
<p>The Uprising began at a crucial juncture as the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet</a> <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Army" id="w">Army</a> <a href="/wiki/Lublin-Brest_Operation" id="w">was approaching Warsaw</a>. The Uprising&#39;s chief objective was to drive the German occupiers from the city, helping with the larger fight against the Axis.  Secondary political objectives were to liberate Warsaw before the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a> arrived, so as to underscore Polish <a href="/wiki/Sovereignty" id="w">sovereignty</a>, and to undo the Allied division of <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe" id="w">Central Europe</a> into <a href="/wiki/Sphere_of_influence" id="w">spheres of influence</a>. <a href="/wiki/Polish_government-in-exile" id="w">Polish authorities</a> were to reappear in liberated Warsaw and challenge the <a href="/wiki/Polish_Committee_of_National_Liberation" id="w">Soviet puppet government</a> that was to rule Poland.</p>
<p>By <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>, Soviet forces had reached a point a few hundred metres from the city, across the <a href="/wiki/Vistula_River" id="w">Vistula River</a>, but they made no further headway during the Uprising leading to allegations that <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" id="w">Joseph Stalin</a> had wanted the insurrection to fail.</p>
<p>Polish losses amounted to 18,000 soldiers killed and 25,000 wounded, in addition to between 120,000 and 200,000 civilian deaths, mostly from mass murders conducted by retreating German troops. German casualties totalled over 17,000 soldiers killed and over 9,000 wounded. During the <a href="/wiki/Urban_combat" id="w">urban combat</a> approximately 25% of Warsaw&#39;s buildings were destroyed. Following the surrender of Polish forces on October 2, German troops systematically burned the city block by block. Together with earlier damage suffered in 1939 and during the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising" id="w">Warsaw Ghetto Uprising</a> (1943), over 85% of the city had been destroyed. By January 1945, when the Soviets finally entered the city, Warsaw had practically ceased to exist.</p>

<p>The Warsaw Uprising, or at least some form of insurrection in Poland, had been planned long in advance.<sup id="_ref-Sanford_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sanford" title="">[1]</a></sup> From its inception, the <a href="/wiki/Armia_Krajowa" id="w">Home Army</a> was planning a national uprising against the German forces. Initial plans created by the <a href="/wiki/Polish_government-in-exile" id="w">Polish government-in-exile</a> in 1942 assumed that the <a href="/wiki/Allies" id="w">Allied</a> invasion of Europe would lead to the withdrawal of considerable German forces from the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" id="w">Eastern Front</a> for the defence of the <a href="/wiki/Third_Reich" id="w">Third Reich</a>. The Home Army would act to prevent troop transfer to the west and to allow the British and American forces to seize Germany by breaking all communication links with the majority of the German forces massed in the Soviet Union.

The <a href="/wiki/Armia_Krajowa" id="w">Home Army&#39;s</a> initial plans for a national uprising, <a href="/wiki/Operation_Tempest" id="w">Operation Tempest</a>, which would link up with <a href="/wiki/Western_Allies" id="w">Western Allies</a> forces, changed in 1943 when the situation on the Eastern Front made it apparent that the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a>, rather than the Western Allies, would force the Germans from Poland. By 1943 it was clear that the allied invasion of Europe would not come in time, and that in all probability the Red Army would reach the pre-war borders of Poland before the invasion could make notable headway. In February 1943, General <a href="/wiki/Stefan_Rowecki" id="w">Stefan Rowecki</a> amended the plan. The Uprising was to be started in three phases, the first being in the East (with main centres of resistance in <a href="/wiki/Lw%C3%B3w" id="w">Lw√≥w</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wilno" id="w">Wilno</a>), before the advancing Red Army. The second part was to include armed struggle in the belt between the <a href="/wiki/Curzon_Line" id="w">Curzon Line</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Vistula" id="w">Vistula</a> river, while the third phase was to be a nationwide uprising throughout Poland. <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" id="w">Warsaw</a> was chosen, partially, because of its status as a pre-war capital and partly because it was assumed that the Germans would wish to hold onto the city for as long as possible, as a tool for morale boosting, and as a base for communications, supply, and troop movements.</p>
<p>The Polish government-in-exile carried out frantic diplomatic efforts to gain support from their allies prior to the start of <a href="/wiki/Military_description_of_the_Warsaw_Uprising" id="w">battle</a>. However the Allies support for the Polish resistance was not high on the priority list. The Polish government in London asked the <a href="/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive" id="w">Special Operations Executive</a> (SOE) and the <a href="/wiki/Foreign_Office" id="w">Foreign Office</a> several times for an allied mission to be sent to Poland;<sup id="_ref-Soviets_and_AK_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Soviets_and_AK" title="">[2]</a></sup> since such missions had already been dispatched to all other resistance movements in Europe, such as <a href="/wiki/Albania" id="w">Albania</a>, <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia" id="w">Czechoslovakia</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greece</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norway" id="w">Norway</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia" id="w">Yugoslavia</a>. However, the Polish pleas were not heeded until December 1944.

For the Soviets, this represented more of a hindrance than a help. Polish-Soviet relations were broken off on <a href="/wiki/April_25" id="w">April 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a> as a result of the <a href="/wiki/Katyn_massacre" id="w">Katyn massacre</a> and <a href="/wiki/Soviet_partisans_in_Poland" id="w">Soviet partisans often clashed with Polish partisans</a>.<sup id="_ref-Soviets_and_AK_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Soviets_and_AK" title="">[2]</a></sup> It became obvious that the advancing Red Army might not come to Poland as a liberator but rather, as General <a href="/wiki/Stefan_Grot-Rowecki" id="w">Stefan Grot-Rowecki</a> put it, as &#34;our Allies&#39; ally.&#34; On <a href="/wiki/November_26" id="w">November 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a>, the Polish government-in-exile issued an instruction to the effect that if diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union were not resumed before the Soviet entry into Poland, Home Army forces were to remain underground pending further decisions. However, the Home Army commander took a different approach, and on <a href="/wiki/November_30" id="w">November 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a>, the final version of the plan, which became known as Operation Tempest, was devised.  Although doubts existed about the military wisdom of a major uprising, planning continued nonetheless.</p> 
<p>The situation came to a head on <a href="/wiki/13_July" id="w">13 July</a> as <a href="/wiki/Operation_Bagration" id="w">Operation Bagration</a>, the Soviet offensive, crossed the old <a href="/wiki/Polish_border" id="w">Polish border</a>. At this point the Poles had to make a decision: either initiate the uprising in the current difficult political situation and risk problems with Soviet support, or fail to rebel and face <a href="/wiki/Soviet_propaganda" id="w">Soviet propaganda</a> describing <i><a href="/wiki/Armia_Krajowa" id="w">Armia Krajowa</a></i> as collaborators and ineffective cowards. The plan was intended both as a political manifestation of the influence of Polish Government in Exile and as a direct operation against German occupiers.<sup id="_ref-wufaq_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wufaq" title="">[3]</a></sup> The fear was that in the aftermath of the war the Allies would ignore the legal London-based government. It was clear both that Poland would be &#39;liberated&#39; by the Red Army, and that the Soviet Union did not recognise the Government-in-Exile. The urgency for this decision increased as it became clear that after any successful Polish-Soviet co-operation in the liberation of various towns (for example, in the <a href="/wiki/Operation_Ostra_Brama" id="w">Operation Ostra Brama</a>), the Soviet <a href="/wiki/NKVD" id="w">NKVD</a> units who followed behind would either shoot or arrest most Polish officers and those Polish soldiers who could not or would not join the <a href="/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces_in_the_East" id="w">Soviet controlled forces</a>.<sup id="_ref-Soviets_and_AK_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Soviets_and_AK" title="">[2]</a></sup> Following a flood of reports from the eastern territories about forced demilitarisation, trials and execution of Home Army soldiers by the Soviets, on <a href="/wiki/21_July" id="w">21 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a> the High Command of the Home Army decided to expand the scope of Operation Tempest to include Warsaw itself. The date for the Warsaw Uprising was set as <a href="/wiki/1_August" id="w">1 August</a>. On <a href="/wiki/25_July" id="w">25 July</a> the Polish government in exile in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> approved the planned uprising in Warsaw. </p>
<p>In the early summer of 1944, German planning required Warsaw to serve as <a href="/wiki/Festung_Warschau" id="w">the defensive centre of the area</a> and to be held at all costs. The Germans had fortifications constructed and built up their forces in the area. This process slowed after the failed <a href="/wiki/July_20_Plot" id="w">July 20 Plot</a> to assassinate <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Adolf Hitler</a>, but by late July 1944, German forces had almost reached their full strength again. On <a href="/wiki/July_27" id="w">July 27</a>, the head of the General Government, <a href="/wiki/Hans_Frank" id="w">Hans Frank</a>, called for 100,000 Polish men between the ages of 17‚Äì65 to present themselves at several designated meeting places in Warsaw the following day,<sup id="_ref-wufaq_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wufaq" title="">[3]</a></sup> as part of the plan which envisaged the Poles constructing fortifications for the <a href="/wiki/Wehrmacht" id="w">Wehrmacht</a> in and around the city. The Home Army viewed this move as an attempt to neutralise the underground forces, and the underground urged Warsaw inhabitants to ignore it.<sup id="_ref-wufaq_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wufaq" title="">[3]</a></sup> Fearing German reprisals following the ignored order, and believing that time was of the essence, General <a href="/wiki/Tadeusz_B%C3%B3r-Komorowski" id="w">Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski</a> ordered full mobilisation of Home Army forces in the Warsaw area on <a href="/wiki/1_August" id="w">1 August</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>.<sup id="_ref-wufaq_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wufaq" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>This mobilization decision had some key ramifications for the Soviet Union. Stalin decried for not being officially consulted on the uprising and thus suspected subterfuge from his Western allies. In retrospect, both sides were jockeying for regional political alignment, with the Polish Home Army&#39;s desire for a pro-Western Polish government and the Soviet&#39;s intention of establishing a Polish Communist regime.</p>
<p>The official Soviet propaganda line tried to portray the Polish underground as &#34;waiting with their arms at ease&#34; and not fighting the common enemy.{{Fact}} As the Soviet forces approached Warsaw in June and July 1944, Soviet radio stations demanded a full national uprising in Warsaw to cut the communication lines of German units still on the right bank of the Vistula; just two days prior to the uprising, Soviet-controlled radio <i>Kosciuszko</i>  had called for the Polish people to rise in arms.<sup id="_ref-wufaq_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wufaq" title="">[3]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/July_29" id="w">July 29</a><a class="externallink" href="http://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/kosciuszko.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/kosciuszko.htm">http://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/kosciuszko.htm</a>, 1944, the first Soviet armoured units reached the outskirts of Warsaw, but were counter-attacked by <a href="/wiki/German_39th_Panzer_Corps" id="w">German 39th Panzer Corps</a>, comprising <a href="/wiki/4th_Panzer_Division" id="w">4th Panzer Division</a>, <a href="/wiki/5th_SS_Panzer_Division" id="w">5th SS Panzer Division</a>, <a href="/wiki/19th_Panzer_Division" id="w">19th Panzer Division</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Hermann_Goering_Panzer_Division" id="w">Hermann Goering Panzer Division</a>.<sup id="_ref-Glants_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glants" title="">[4]</a></sup>

<p>The Home Army forces of the Warsaw District numbered about 45,000 soldiers, of which 23,000 were equipped and combat-ready; about 2,500 further soldiers came from the ranks of other formations like the far-right <a href="/wiki/Narodowe_Si%C5%82y_Zbrojne" id="w">Narodowe Si≈Çy Zbrojne</a> and the communist <a href="/wiki/Armia_Ludowa" id="w">Armia Ludowa</a>.<sup id="_ref-WUmuseumcom_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WUmuseumcom" title="">[6]</a></sup> Most of them had trained for several years in <a href="/wiki/Partisan_(military)" id="w">partisan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Urban_guerrilla" id="w">urban guerrilla</a> warfare, but lacked experience in prolonged daylight fighting. The forces lacked equipment,<sup id="_ref-WUmuseumcom_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WUmuseumcom" title="">[6]</a></sup> especially since the Home Army had shuttled weapons and men to the east of the city before the decision on <a href="/wiki/21_July" id="w">21 July</a> to include Warsaw in Operation Tempest. A number of other partisan groups also subordinated themselves to Home Army command for the uprising. Many volunteers, including some <a href="/wiki/Polish_Jews" id="w">Jews</a> freed from the concentration camp in the ruins of the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto" id="w">Warsaw Ghetto</a>, joined during the fighting.<sup id="_ref-Jews_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jews" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>General <a href="/wiki/Antoni_Chru%C5%9Bciel" id="w">Antoni Chru≈õciel</a>, codename &#39;Monter&#39;, commanded the Polish forces in Warsaw. Initially he divided his forces into eight areas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Area I (<a href="/wiki/≈ör%C3%B3dmie%C5%9Bcie" id="w">≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie</a>, Old Town)</li>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_20" id="w">September 20</a> a re-organisation of this structure took place to align with the structure of Polish forces fighting with the Western Allies. The entire force, renamed the Warsaw Home Army Corps (<i>Warszawski Korpus Armii Krajowej</i>) and commanded by General Antoni Chru≈õciel (<i>Monter</i>), formed into three <a href="/wiki/Infantry_division" id="w">infantry divisions</a>.</p>
<p>As of <a href="/wiki/August_1" id="w">August 1</a> their military supplies consisted of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1,000 rifles</li>
<li>1,700 pistols</li>
<li>300 machine pistols</li>
<li>60 submachine guns</li>
<li>7 machine guns (medium or light, such as the <a href="/wiki/MG_42" id="w">MG 42</a>)</li>
<li>35 <a href="/wiki/Anti-tank_gun" id="w">anti-tank guns</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anti-tank_rifle" id="w">anti-tank rifles</a> (including several <a href="/wiki/PIAT" id="w">PIATs</a>)</li>
<li>25,000 <a href="/wiki/Hand_grenade" id="w">hand grenades</a> (mainly of the &#39;stick&#39; variety).</li></ul>
<p>In the course of the fighting the Poles obtained further supplies through <a href="/wiki/Airdrop" id="w">airdrops</a> and by capture from the enemy (including several <a href="/wiki/Armoured_vehicle" id="w">armoured vehicles</a>). Also, the insurgents‚Äô workshops worked busily throughout the uprising, producing 300 <a href="/wiki/Automatic_pistol" id="w">automatic pistols</a>, 150 <a href="/wiki/Flame-thrower" id="w">flame-throwers</a>, 40,000 grenades, a number of <a href="/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)" id="w">mortars</a>, and even an <a href="/wiki/Armoured_car" id="w">armoured car</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Kubu%C5%9B" id="w">Kubu≈õ</a></i>).</p>

<p>In late July the German units stationed in and around Warsaw were divided into three categories. The first - and the most numerous - was the garrison of Warsaw. As of <a href="/wiki/July_31" id="w">July 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>, it numbered some 11,000 troops under General <a href="/wiki/Rainer_Stahel" id="w">Rainer Stahel</a>.<sup id="_ref-Borkiewicz_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Borkiewicz" title="">[8]</a></sup> These forces included:

<li>4,000 <a href="/wiki/Luftwaffe" id="w">Luftwaffe</a> personnel (1,000 at <a href="/wiki/Ok%C4%99cie_airport" id="w">Okƒôcie airport</a>, 700 at <a href="/wiki/Bielany" id="w">Bielany</a>, 1,000 in <a href="/wiki/Boernerowo" id="w">Boernerowo</a>, 300 at <a href="/wiki/S%C5%82u%C5%BCewiec" id="w">S≈Çu≈ºewiec</a> and 1,000 in <a href="/wiki/Anti-air_artillery" id="w">anti-air artillery</a> posts throughout the city</li>
<li>Approximately 2,000 men of the <i>Wachtregiment Warschau</i> ({{lang-de}}), including four infantry battalions (<i>Patz</i>, <i>Baltz</i>, No.996 and No.997), an <a href="/wiki/SS" id="w">SS</a> reconnaissance squadron (ca. 350 men), factory guards, <a href="/wiki/Andrey_Vlasov" id="w">Andrey Vlasov</a>&#39;s men, Turkmmen and other auxiliary troops.</li></ul>
<p>These well-equipped German forces had been prepared for the defence of the city&#39;s key positions for many months. Several hundred concrete <a href="/wiki/Bunker" id="w">bunkers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barbed_wire" id="w">barbed wire</a> lines protected the buildings and areas occupied by the Germans.</p>
<p>Apart from the garrison itself, there were numerous units stationed on both banks of the Vistula or moving through the city in both directions. These comprised some 15,000 to 16,000 <a href="/wiki/Wehrmacht" id="w">Wehrmacht</a> soldiers{{Fact}}. Also, at least 90,000 additional German troops were available from occupation forces in the surrounding area{{Fact}}.</p>
<p>The second category was formed by police and <a href="/wiki/SS" id="w">SS</a> under Col. <a href="/wiki/Paul_Otto_Geibel" id="w">Paul Otto Geibel</a>, numbering initially 5,710 men.<sup id="_ref-Borkiewicz-41_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Borkiewicz-41" title="">[9]</a></sup> These included three <a href="/wiki/Schutzpolizei" id="w">Schutzpolizei</a> battalions (1,000 men) and two <a href="/wiki/Sauferkaserne" id="w">Sauferkaserne</a> SS battalions (1,000 men), as well as reserve companies (300 men), an <a href="/wiki/SA" id="w">SA</a> battalion (400 men), military police, <a href="/wiki/Ordnungspolizei" id="w">Ordnungspolizei</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sicherheitspolizei" id="w">Sicherheitspolizei</a>, training units and many smaller units up to 400 men strong. </p>
<p>The third category was formed by various sentry and guard units, altogether some 3,500 men strong. Among them were detachments of the <a href="/wiki/Bahnschutz" id="w">Bahnschutz</a> (rail guard), <a href="/wiki/Werkschutz" id="w">Werkschutz</a> (factory guard) and a transport protection battalion.</p>
<p>In the course of the uprising the German side received reinforcements on a daily basis. As of <a href="/wiki/August_23" id="w">August 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>, the German units directly involved with fighting in Warsaw included:

<a id="W-hour" name="W-hour"></a><h2> W-hour </h2>
<p>After days of hesitation, at 17:30 on July 31st, the Polish headquarters scheduled &#34;W-hour&#34; (from the Polish <i>wybuch</i>, &#34;outbreak&#34;), the moment of the start of the uprising, for 17:00 of the following day.<sup id="_ref-wutime_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wutime" title="">[10]</a></sup> The decision proved to be a costly strategic mistake as the under-equipped Polish forces were prepared for a series of coordinated surprise night attacks and the daylight exposed them to German machine gun fire. Although a large number of the partisan units were already mobilized and waiting at assembly points throughout the city, the mobilization of thousands of young men and women was hard to conceal and fighting started in advance of &#34;W-hour&#34;,<sup id="_ref-wutime_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wutime" title="">[10]</a></sup> notably in the boroughs of <a href="/wiki/≈ªoliborz" id="w">≈ªoliborz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mokot%C3%B3w" id="w">Mokot√≥w</a> and <a href="/wiki/Czerniak%C3%B3w" id="w">Czerniak√≥w</a>, around <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_Square" id="w">Napoleon Square</a>, in the vicinity of the <a href="/wiki/Hale_Mirowskie" id="w">Hale Mirowskie</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plac_Kercelego" id="w">Plac Kercelego</a> marketplaces, and at <a href="/wiki/Okopowa" id="w">Okopowa</a> street.</p>
<p>Until &#34;W-hour&#34; these incidents were not generally perceived as part of a larger plan. However, at around 16:00, SS-Standartenfuhrer <a href="/wiki/Paul_Otto_Geibel" id="w">Paul Otto Geibel</a>, chief of police and SS in the Warsaw District, received a warning about the uprising from an anonymous &#39;lieutenant of the Luftwaffe&#39;, who had in turn been warned about it by a Polish woman.{{Fact}} He alerted the units under his command, which thus were prepared for the assault at 17:00. This drastically reduced the element of surprise for the insurgents. On the other hand, while the Germans had been considering the possibility of an uprising, they had no operational plans to meet such an occurrence.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances the coordinated attacks on the German outposts and garrisons were largely successful. The first two days were crucial in establishing the battlefield for the rest of the fight. Most successes were achieved in the city centre (<a href="/wiki/Warszawa-%C5%9Ar%C3%B3dmie%C5%9Bcie" id="w">≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie</a>) and the old town (<a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Old_Town" id="w">Stare Miasto</a>) and the nearby boroughs of <a href="/wiki/Wola" id="w">Wola</a>, where most objectives were captured, although several major German strongholds remained, and in some areas of Wola Poles sustained heavy losses that forced them to retreat early on. In other areas such as <a href="/wiki/Mokot%C3%B3w" id="w">Mokot√≥w</a> the attackers almost completely failed to secure any of their objectives and controlled only the residential areas. In <a href="/wiki/Praga" id="w">Praga</a>, on the eastern bank of the Vistula river, the concentration of German forces was so high that the Poles fighting there were quickly forced back into hiding.<sup id="_ref-Bartelski_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bartelski" title="">[11]</a></sup> Most crucially, the fighters in different areas failed to link up, either with each other or with areas outside Warsaw, leaving each section of the city isolated from the others.</p>
<p>After the first hours of fighting many units adopted a more defensive strategy while the civilian population started erecting barricades throughout the city. Despite all the problems, by <a href="/wiki/August_4" id="w">August 4</a> most of the city lay in Polish hands.</p>

<a id="First_four_days" name="First_four_days"></a><h2> First four days </h2>
<p>The uprising was intended to last a few days until Soviet forces arrived;<sup id="_ref-Madajczyk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Madajczyk" title="">[12]</a></sup> however, this never happened, and the Polish forces had to fight with little outside assistance. The results of the first two days of fighting in different parts of the city were as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Area I</i> (city centre and the Old Town): Units captured most of their assigned territory, but failed to capture areas where there were strong German pockets of resistance (the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_University" id="w">Warsaw University</a> buildings, <a href="/wiki/PAST" id="w">PAST</a> skyscraper, or the headquarters of the German garrison in the <a href="/wiki/Saxon_Palace" id="w">Saxon Palace</a>). They thus failed to create a central stronghold and secure communication links to other areas. The main failures were in not establishing a secure land connection with the northern area of ≈ªoliborz through the northern railway line and the <a href="/wiki/Cytadela" id="w">Cytadela</a> fortress, as well as not capturing the bridges over the Vistula. The forces mobilized in the city centre also failed to capture the <a href="/wiki/Nur_f%C3%BCr_Deutsche" id="w">German-only</a> area near the Szucha avenue.</li>
<li><i>Area II</i> (≈ªoliborz, <a href="/wiki/Marymont" id="w">Marymont</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bielany" id="w">Bielany</a>): Units here failed to secure the most important military targets in the area of ≈ªoliborz. Many units retreated outside of the city, into the forests. Although most of the area was captured, the soldiers of Colonel <i><a href="/wiki/Mieczys%C5%82aw_Niedzielski" id="w">≈ªywiciel</a></i> failed to capture the Cytadela fortress area and break through German defences at <a href="/wiki/Warszawa_Gda%C5%84ska" id="w">Warszawa Gda≈Ñska</a> railway station.</li>
<li><i>Area III</i> (<a href="/wiki/Wola" id="w">Wola</a>): Units here initially succeeded in securing most of the territory, but sustained heavy losses (up to 30%). Some units retreated into the forests, while others retreated to the eastern part of the area. In the northern part of Wola the soldiers of Colonel <i><a href="/wiki/Jan_Mazurkiewicz" id="w">Rados≈Çaw</a></i> managed to capture the German barracks, the German supply depot at <a href="/wiki/Stawki" id="w">Stawki Street</a>, and the flanking position at the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Jewish_Cemetery" id="w">Jewish cemetery</a>.</li>
<li><i>Area IV</i> (<a href="/wiki/Ochota" id="w">Ochota</a>): The units mobilized in this area did not capture either the territory or the military targets (the <i><a href="/wiki/G%C4%99si%C3%B3wka" id="w">Gƒôsi√≥wka</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Concentration_camp" id="w">concentration camp</a>, SS and <a href="/wiki/Sipo" id="w">Sipo</a> barracks located in former Students&#39; House on <i><a href="/wiki/Gabriel_Narutowicz" id="w">Narutowicz</a> Square</i>). After suffering heavy casualties most of the forces of the <a href="/wiki/Armia_Krajowa" id="w">Armia Krajowa</a> retreated to the forests west of Warsaw. Only two small units of approximately 200 to 300 men under Lieut. <a href="/wiki/Andrzej_Chyczewski" id="w">Gustaw</a> remained in the area and managed to create strong pockets of resistance. They were later reinforced by units from the city centre. Elite units of the <a href="/wiki/KeDyw" id="w">KeDyw</a> managed to secure most of the northern part of the area and captured all of the military targets there. However, they were soon tied down by German tactical counter-attacks from the south and west.</li>
<li><i>Area V</i> (<a href="/wiki/Mokot%C3%B3w" id="w">Mokot√≥w</a>): The situation in this area was very serious from the start of the hostilities. The partisans were to capture the heavily-defended and fortified so-called Police Area (<i>Dzielnica policyjna</i>) on <a href="/wiki/Rakowiecka" id="w">Rakowiecka</a> Street. They were also to establish a connection with the city centre through open terrain at the former airfield of <a href="/wiki/Pole_Mokotowskie" id="w">Pole Mokotowskie</a>. As both of the areas were heavily fortified and could be approached only through open terrain, the assaults failed. Some units retreated into the forests, while others managed to capture parts of Dolny Mokot√≥w, which was, however, severed from most communications routes to other areas.</li>
<li><i>Area VI</i> (<a href="/wiki/Praga" id="w">Praga</a>): The Uprising was also started on the right bank of the Vistula. The main task of the <i>Area VI</i> (<i>Obw√≥d VI</i>) was to seize the bridges on the river and secure the bridgeheads until the arrival of the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a>. It was clear that, since the location was far worse than that of the other areas, there was no chance of any help from the outside. After some minor initial successes, the forces of Lt.Col. <a href="/wiki/Antoni_%C5%BBurowski" id="w">Antoni ≈ªurowski</a> were badly outnumbered by the German forces concentrated there. The fights were halted, and the Home Army forces located in the Praga area were forced back into the underground.<sup id="_ref-wutime_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wutime" title="">[10]</a></sup> After the Soviets finally reached the right bank of the Vistula on <a href="/wiki/September_10" id="w">September 10</a>, the officers proposed recreating the pre-war <a href="/wiki/36th_Infantry_Regiment_(Poland)" id="w">36th &#39;&#39;Academic Legion&#39;&#39; Infantry Regiment</a>; however, they were all arrested by the <a href="/wiki/NKVD" id="w">NKVD</a> and sent to Russia for interrogation.</li>
<li><i>Area VII</i> (<i><a href="/wiki/Powiat" id="w">Powiat</a> warszawski</i>): this area consisted of territories outside Warsaw city limits. Actions here mostly failed to capture their targets.</li></ul>
<p>An additional area within the Polish command structure was formed by the units of the <a href="/wiki/Kedyw" id="w">Kedyw</a> (<i>Directorate of Sabotage and Diversion</i>), an elite formation that was to guard the headquarters and was to be used as an <i>armed ambulance</i>, thrown into the battle in the most endangered areas. These units secured parts of ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie and Wola; along with the units of <i>Area I</i>, they were the most successful during the first few hours.</p>
<p>Among the most notable primary targets that were not taken during the opening stages of the uprising were the airfields of <a href="/wiki/Ok%C4%99cie" id="w">Okƒôcie</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pole_Mokotowskie" id="w">Pole Mokotowskie</a>, as well as the PAST sky-scraper overlooking the city centre and the <a href="/wiki/Warszawa_Gda%C5%84ska" id="w">Warszawa Gda≈Ñska</a> guarding the passage between the centre and the northern borough of ≈ªoliborz.</p>
<a id="Wola_massacre" name="Wola_massacre"></a><h2> Wola massacre </h2>

The Uprising reached its apogee on <a href="/wiki/August_4" id="w">August 4</a> when the Home Army soldiers managed to establish front lines in the westernmost boroughs of <a href="/wiki/Wola" id="w">Wola</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ochota" id="w">Ochota</a>. However, the moment of greatest gains was also the moment at which the German army stopped its retreat westwards and began receiving reinforcements. On the same day SS General <a href="/wiki/Erich_von_dem_Bach" id="w">Erich von dem Bach</a> was appointed commander of all the forces employed against the Uprising,<sup id="_ref-wutime_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wutime" title="">[10]</a></sup> and began to counter-attack with the aim of linking up with the remaining German pockets and then cutting off the Uprising from the Vistula river. Among the units to arrive at the city at that time were forces of <a href="/wiki/Oskar_Dirlewanger" id="w">Oskar Dirlewanger</a>,<sup id="_ref-wutime_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wutime" title="">[10]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Willy_Schmidt" id="w">Willy Schmidt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heinz_Reinefarth" id="w">Heinz Reinefarth</a>.<sup id="_ref-wutime_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wutime" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

On <a href="/wiki/August_5" id="w">August 5</a> the three German groups started their advance westward along <i>Wolska</i> and <i>G√≥rczewska</i> streets toward the main East-West communication line of <a href="/wiki/Aleje_Jerozolimskie" id="w">Aleje Jerozolimskie</a> Avenue. Their advance was halted, but the Reinefarth and Dirlewanger regiments began carrying out <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler" id="w">Heinrich Himmler</a>&#39;s orders: behind the lines, special SS, police and Wehrmacht groups went from house to house, shooting the inhabitants and burning their bodies.<sup id="_ref-wutime_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wutime" title="">[10]</a></sup> By <a href="/wiki/August_8" id="w">August 8</a>, some 40,000 civilians had been killed in Wola alone,<sup id="_ref-BBC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC" title="">[13]</a></sup> though some estimates cite numbers as high as 100,000.<sup id="_ref-K≈Çoczowski_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-K≈Çoczowski" title="">[14]</a></sup>

The aim of this policy was to crush the will to fight and put the uprising to an end without having to commit to heavy city fighting.<sup id="_ref-WUWola"_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WUWola"" title="">[15]</a></sup> Until mid-September, the Germans shot all captured insurgents on the spot. The main perpetrators were <a href="/wiki/Oskar_Dirlewanger" id="w">Oskar Dirlewanger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bronislav_Kaminski" id="w">Bronislav Kaminski</a>, who committed the cruelest atrocities.{{Fact}} After von dem Bach arrived in Warsaw (August 7), it became clear that atrocities only stiffened the resistance and that some political solution should be found, considering the small forces at the disposal of the German commander. The aim was to gain a significant victory to show the <a href="/wiki/Armia_Krajowa" id="w">Home Army</a> the futility of further fighting and induce them to surrender. This did not succeed, but from the end of September, some of the captured Polish soldiers were treated as <a href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_war" id="w">POWs</a>.{{Fact}}</p>
<a id="Stalemate" name="Stalemate"></a><h2> Stalemate </h2>
<p>{{cquote}}
Despite the loss of Wola, the Polish resistance stiffened. <i>Zo≈õka</i> and <i>Wacek</i> battalions managed to capture the ruins of the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto" id="w">Warsaw Ghetto</a> and liberate the <a href="/wiki/G%C4%99si%C3%B3wka" id="w">Gƒôsi√≥wka</a> concentration camp, freeing about 350 Jews.<sup id="_ref-wutime_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wutime" title="">[10]</a></sup> The area became one of the main communication links between the insurgents fighting in Wola and those defending the Old Town. On <a href="/wiki/August_7" id="w">August 7</a> German forces were strengthened by the arrival of tanks with civilians being used as <a href="/wiki/Human_shield" id="w">human shields</a>.<sup id="_ref-wutime_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wutime" title="">[10]</a></sup> After two days of heavy fighting they managed to bisect Wola and reach the <a href="/wiki/Bankowy_Square" id="w">Bankowy Square</a>. However, by then the net of barricades, street fortifications and tank obstacles was already well-prepared and both sides reached a stalemate, with heavy house-to-house fighting.</p>
<p>Between <a href="/wiki/August_9" id="w">August 9</a> and <a href="/wiki/August_18" id="w">August 18</a> pitched battles raged around the Old Town and nearby Bankowy Square, with successful attacks by the Germans and counter-attacks from the Poles. Once again, the Germans used demoralizing tactics: targeted attacks against clearly marked hospitals (reminiscent of Luftwaffe attacks against hospitals in September, 1939). German tactics hinged on bombardment through the use of <a href="/wiki/Heavy_artillery" id="w">heavy artillery</a> (including the <a href="/wiki/Schwerer_Gustav" id="w">Schwerer Gustav</a> super-heavy mortar) and <a href="/wiki/Tactical_bomber" id="w">tactical bombers</a>, against which the Poles were unable to effectively defend, as they lacked anti-aircraft artillery weapons.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Although the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad" id="w">Battle of Stalingrad</a> had already shown the danger which a city can pose to armies which fight within it and the importance of local support, the Warsaw Uprising was probably the first demonstration that in an urban terrain, a vastly under-equipped force supported by the civilian population can hold its own against better-equipped professional soldiers‚Äî though at the cost of considerable sacrifices on the part of the city&#39;s residents.</p>

Their initiative was however not supported by the Soviet High Command. With inadequate artillery, air support, and numbers, the landing troops sustained heavy casualties and were forced to retreat. After the failure of repeated attempts by the 1st Polish Army to link up with the insurgents, the Soviets limited their assistance to sporadic artillery and air support. Plans for a river crossing were suspended &#34;for at least 4 months&#34;, since operations against the five <a href="/wiki/Panzer" id="w">panzer</a> divisions on 9th Army&#39;s order of battle were problematic at that point, and the commander of the 1st Polish Army, General <a href="/wiki/Zygmunt_Berling" id="w">Zygmunt Berling</a>, who ordered the crossing of the Vistula by his units, was relieved of his duties by his Soviet superiors.<sup id="_ref-Soviets_and_AK_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Soviets_and_AK" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>From this point on, the Warsaw Uprising can be seen as a one-sided war of attrition or, alternatively, as a fight for acceptable terms of surrender. Fighting ended on <a href="/wiki/2_October" id="w">2 October</a> when the Polish forces were finally forced to capitulate.</p>

In 1939 Warsaw had roughly 1,350,000 inhabitants. Over a million were still living in the city at the start of the Uprising. In Polish-controlled territory, during the first weeks of the Uprising, people tried to recreate the normal day-to-day life of their free country. Cultural life was vibrant, both among the soldiers and civilian population, with theatres, post offices, newspapers and similar activities.<sup id="_ref-Nawrocka_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nawrocka" title="">[16]</a></sup> Boys and girls of the <a href="/wiki/Zwi%C4%85zek_Harcerstwa_Polskiego" id="w">Polish Scouts</a> acted as couriers for an underground postal service, risking their lives daily to transmit any information that might help their people.<sup id="_ref-Tomczyk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tomczyk" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-wutime_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wutime" title="">[10]</a></sup> Near the end of the Uprising, lack of food, medicine, overcrowding and indiscriminate German air and artillery assault on the city made the civilian situation more and more desperate.</p>
<a id="Food_shortages" name="Food_shortages"></a><h2> Food shortages </h2>
<p>As the Uprising was supposed to be relieved by the Soviets in a matter of days, the Polish underground did not predict food shortages would be a problem. However, as the fighting dragged on, the inhabitants of the city faced hunger and starvation. Soon horses, dogs and cats disappeared from the city&#39;s streets. The situation was improved by the Home Army units who captured several German army depots and started distribution of food through the net of public eateries. A major break-through took place on August 6, when the Polish units recaptured the <a href="/wiki/Haberbusch_i_Schiele" id="w">Haberbusch i Schiele</a> brewery complex at Ceglana Street. From that time on the Varsovians lived mostly on barley from the brewery&#39;s warehouses. Every day up to several thousand people organized into cargo teams reported to the brewery for bags of barley and then distributed them in the city centre. The barley was then ground in coffee grinders and boiled with water to form a so-called spit-soup ({{lang-pl}}). The &#34;Sowi≈Ñski&#34; Battalion managed to hold the brewery until the end of the fighting.</p>
<p>Another serious problem for civilians and soldiers alike was a shortage of water.<sup id="_ref-wutime_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wutime" title="">[10]</a></sup> By mid-August most of the water conduits were either out of order or filled with corpses. In addition, the main water pumping station remained in German hands.<sup id="_ref-wutime_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wutime" title="">[10]</a></sup> To prevent the spread of epidemics and provide the people with water, the authorities ordered all janitors to supervise the construction of water wells in the backyards of every house. On September 21 the Germans blew up the remaining pumping stations at Koszykowa street and after that the public wells were the only source of potable water in the besieged city.<sup id="_ref-MƒÖczewski_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MƒÖczewski" title="">[18]</a></sup> By the end of September, the City Centre district had more than 90 functioning wells.<sup id="_ref-wutime_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wutime" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

Limited support in terms of <a href="/wiki/Airdrop" id="w">airdrops</a> came from the Western allies; particularly the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" id="w">Royal Air Force</a>, in which a number of Polish, Australian, Canadian and South African pilots flew, made 223 sorties and lost 34 aircraft. However the effect of these airdrops was mostly psychological, as they delivered much smaller number of supplies than was needed by the insurgents, and many air drops landed outside insurgent-controlled territory.</p>
<p>American support was also limited. After Stalin&#39;s objections to supporting the uprising, British Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill" id="w">Winston Churchill</a> telegrammed U.S President <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" id="w">Franklin D.

<p>Also of significant note was the existence of an American airbase at <a href="/wiki/Poltava" id="w">Poltava</a> in Ukraine, from which an airdrop was made during the &#34;Frantic Mission&#34; in mid-September.

<p>The Soviet Union did not give permission to the Allies for use of its airports for those supply operations<sup id="_ref-wufaq_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wufaq" title="">[3]</a></sup> and thus the planes were forced to use bases in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> and Italy which reduced their carrying weight and number of sorties.

<p>{{cquote}}{{Fact}}</p>
<p>The role of the Red Army during the Warsaw Uprising remains controversial and is still disputed by some historians.<sup id="_ref-Glants_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glants" title="">[4]</a></sup> The Uprising started when the Red Army appeared on the city&#39;s doorstep, and the Poles in Warsaw were counting on Soviet aid coming in a matter of days. This basic scenario of an uprising against the Germans launched a few days before the arrival of Allied forces played out successfully in a number of European capitals, notably <a href="/wiki/Liberation_of_Paris" id="w">Paris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prague_uprising" id="w">Prague</a>. However, the Red Army did not extend effective aid to the desperate city despite standing less than 10 km from Warsaw&#39;s city center for about 40 days, and then moving even closer to the right bank of the Vistula river a few hundred meters away from the main battle of the uprising during its last two weeks. Some Western historians, as well as the official line of the Communist regime in Poland before 1989, claimed that the Red Army, exhausted by its long advance on its way to Warsaw, lacked sufficient fighting power to overcome the German forces around Warsaw and extend effective aid to the Uprising. However, it is also speculated that Stalin did not want to aid the Home Army, made up of likely opponents of the Soviet regime in Poland after the war.<sup id="_ref-Glants_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glants" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the reasons given as to why the Warsaw uprising failed, was the failure of the Soviet Red Army to aid the Resistance. The Red Army, which was ordered to halt and therefore positioned just a short distance away on the right bank of the Vistula, was ordered not to link up with or in any way assist the Resistance forces. Post-war political considerations and malice by Stalin are seen as the reason for the Red Army&#39;s failure to act.<sup id="_ref-Soviets_and_AK_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Soviets_and_AK" title="">[2]</a></sup> Another possible reason was the 4‚Äì5 Panzer Divisions in the 46th Panzer Corps and 4th SS Panzer Corps on the order of battle of German 9th Army holding positions east of Warsaw.<sup id="_ref-Glants_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glants" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that Stalin ordered his forces to halt right before entering the city so that the Home Army would not succeed. Had the Home Army triumphed, the Polish government-in-exile in London would have increased their political and moral legitimacy to reinstate a government of its own, rather than accept a Soviet regime. By halting the Red Army&#39;s advance, Stalin guaranteed the destruction of Polish resistance (which would undoubtedly also have resisted Soviet occupation), that it would be the Soviets who &#34;liberated&#34; Warsaw, and that Soviet influence would prevail over Poland.<sup id="_ref-Soviets_and_AK_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Soviets_and_AK" title="">[2]</a></sup> The Soviet military gave a shortage of fuel as the reason why they could not advance. Soviet and Polish sources disagree.</p>
<p>One explanation which has been given for the lack of outside support is that the <a href="/wiki/Lead_up_to_the_Warsaw_Uprising" id="w">uprising began</a> too early and so the nearby Soviet forces were not ready to support. This explanation, however, appears to be contradicted by the fact that, at times during the uprising the <a href="/wiki/NKVD" id="w">NKVD</a> was actively arresting <a href="/wiki/Armia_Krajowa" id="w">Home Army</a> forces in the East of Warsaw and that a large proportion of RAF losses were caused by Soviet anti-aircraft fire. Two further explanations have been given for the failure of Allied support. The first is that the Soviets misunderstood the circumstances of the uprising, though, again this cannot easily explain their attacks on their own <i>allies</i>, the British, without some further complication. The second is that the Soviet forces deliberately blocked the Western Allies from providing support to the Polish forces to support their desire to have Warsaw and any independent-minded Polish forces destroyed before their arrival.</p>
<p>An alternative explanation is that, regardless of Stalin&#39;s political intentions, the Red Army was simply exhausted and hence unable to extend effective support to the Uprising. In support of this thesis, it is often claimed that since the opening of <a href="/wiki/Operation_Bagration" id="w">Operation Bagration</a> many of Red Army units had covered several hundred miles in a far-ranging offensive, and their advance elements were at the very end of their logistical tether. This, coupled with the presence of several fresh SS and Panzer divisions around Warsaw which administered a sharp reverse to the Soviet 2nd Tank Army in the final days of July, was, according to this view, sufficient to stop the Red Army in its tracks on the Warsaw front. However, it must be kept in mind that the units which reached Warsaw in late July 1944 were not part of Bagration, but instead advanced from Western Ukraine as part of the <a href="/wiki/Lublin-Brest_Operation" id="w">Lublin-Brest Operation</a>, covering a much smaller distance. Those units were in fact able to operate quite effectively against German forces to the south and north of Warsaw during August and September, successfully securing bridgeheads over the Vistula and Narew rivers in those sectors. Given that Soviet success, the apparent inactivity on the most direct route of approach towards Warsaw, through the suburb of Praga, lasting through August and the first half of September, is to say the least puzzling. Furthermore, once the Soviet forces seized Praga in mid-September 1944, only poorly supported units of the inexperienced <a href="/wiki/1st_Polish_Army" id="w">1st Polish Army</a> were assigned to attempt the crossing of the river Vistula to aid the insurgents. Those crossings failed to establish a durable foothold on the left bank of the river, and caused considerable casualties among the Polish units involved. It is an open question whether an earlier Soviet effort using more experienced units with adequate support would have been able to reach and cross the Vistula in the Warsaw sector, and provide timely and effective support to the Polish units fighting in the main part of the city. The continued difficulty in accessing the Soviet documents of the time presently located in the Russian archives makes it difficult for historians to answer this question with any degree of certainty.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>The Red Army reached the outskirts of Warsaw in the final days of July, 1944. The Soviet units belonged to the <a href="/wiki/1st_Belorussian_Front" id="w">1st Belorussian Front</a>, participating in the <a href="/wiki/Lublin-Brest_Operation" id="w">Lublin-Brest Operation</a>, between the <a href="/wiki/Lvov-Sandomierz_Operation" id="w">Lvov-Sandomierz Operation</a> on its left and <a href="/wiki/Operation_Bagration" id="w">Operation Bagration</a> on its right.<sup id="_ref-Glants_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glants" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Titans_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Titans" title="">[5]</a></sup> These two operations were colossal defeats for the German army and completely destroyed a large number of German formations.<sup id="_ref-Glants_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glants" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Titans_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Titans" title="">[5]</a></sup> As a consequence, the Germans at this time were desperately trying to put together a new force to hold the line of the Vistula river, the last major river barrier between the Red Army and Germany proper, rushing in units in various stages of readiness from all over Europe. These units included a few high quality panzer and SS divisions pulled from their refits, but also many infantry units of poor quality.<sup id="_ref-Bartoszewski_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bartoszewski" title="">[35]</a></sup> In terms of combat power this scratch force was considerably inferior to what the Soviets had available. On the other hand, after their long advances in June and July the Soviet suffered from the usual difficulties with supply accompanying any long-range Soviet offensive that has advanced far beyond its starting line. Capturing the city of Warsaw would be advantageous for the Soviets if its infrastructure was intact. However, it was not essential, as the Soviets already seized a series of convenient bridgeheads to the south of Warsaw, and were concentrating on defending them against vigorous German counter-attacks.<sup id="_ref-Glants_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glants" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Titans_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Titans" title="">[5]</a></sup> The Red Army was also gearing for a major thrust into the Balkans through Romania at around this time and a large proportion of Soviet resources was being sent in that direction.</p>
<p>In the initial <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Radzymin_(1944)" id="w">battle of Radzymin</a> Soviet advance armoured units of the 2nd Tank Army suffered a major defeat which prevented them from taking Warsaw from the march.<sup id="_ref-Glants_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glants" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Titans_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Titans" title="">[5]</a></sup> It was the presence of Soviet tanks in nearby Wo≈Çomin that sealed the decision of the Home Army leaders in Warsaw to launch the uprising. As a result of the battle, the Soviet tank army was pushed out of <a href="/wiki/Wo%C5%82omin" id="w">Wo≈Çomin</a> to the east of Warsaw and pushed back about 10 km.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> However, the defeat did not change the fact of the overwhelming Soviet superiority over the Germans in the sector.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_1" id="w">August 1</a>, only several hours prior to the outbreak of the Uprising, the Soviet advance was halted by a direct order from the Kremlin.<sup id="_ref-Nowak-Jeziora≈Ñski2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nowak-Jeziora≈Ñski2" title="">[40]</a></sup> Soon afterwards the Soviet tank units stopped to receive any oil from their depots.<sup id="_ref-Nowak-Jeziora≈Ñski2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nowak-Jeziora≈Ñski2" title="">[40]</a></sup> By then the Soviets knew of the planned outbreak from their agents in Warsaw and, more importantly, from the Polish prime minister <a href="/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Miko%C5%82ajczyk" id="w">Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk</a>, who informed them of the Polish plans the day before.<sup id="_ref-Nowak-Jeziora≈Ñski2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nowak-Jeziora≈Ñski2" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Soviets retained their positions to the south-east of Warsaw along the Vistula river, barely 10 km away from the city centre, at the outskirts of the Warsaw right bank suburb <a href="/wiki/Praga" id="w">Praga</a>. The Poles fighting in the Uprising were counting that the Soviet forces would seize Praga in a matter of days and then be in a position to have Red Army units cross to the left bank where the main battle of the Uprising was occurring and come to its aid.</p>
<p>However, on that line along the outskirts of Praga, on the most direct route of advance towards Warsaw, the Soviets stopped their advance and the front line did not move for the next 45 days. The sector was held by the understrength German <a href="/wiki/German_73rd_Infantry_Division" id="w">73rd infantry division</a>, destroyed many times on the Eastern Front and recently reconstituted.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> The division, though weak, did not experience significant Soviet pressure during that period. At the same time, the Red Army was fighting intense battles to the south of Warsaw, to seize and maintain bridgeheads over the Vistula river, and to the north, to gain bridgeheads over the river <a href="/wiki/Narew" id="w">Narew</a>. It was on those sectors that the best panzer and armored divisions that the Germans had were fighting. Despite that, both of these objectives have been mostly secured by early September. </p>
<p>Finally, on <a href="/wiki/September_11" id="w">September 11</a>, the Soviet 47th army began its advance into Praga. The resistance by the German 73rd division was weak and collapsed quickly, with the Soviets gaining control of the suburb by <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>. With the taking of Praga, the Soviet forces were now directly across the river from the Uprising fighting in left-bank Warsaw. If the Soviets had reached this stage in early August, the crossing of the river would have been easy, as the Poles then held considerable stretches of the riverfront. By mid-September a series of German attacks have reduced the Poles to holding one narrow stretch of the riverbank, in the district of <a href="/wiki/Czerniakow" id="w">Czerniakow</a>. Nevertheless, the Soviets now made an attempt to aid the Uprising, but not by using Red Army units. {{Fact}}</p>

<p>The Germans intensified their attacks on the Home Army positions near the river to prevent any further landings, which could seriously compromise their line of defense, but weren&#39;t able to make any significant advances for several days, while Polish forces held those vital positions in preparation for new expected wave of Soviet landings. Polish units from the eastern shore attempted several more landings, and from 15 to 23 September sustained heavy losses (including destruction of all landing boats and most of other river crossing equipment).<sup id="_ref-Berling landings_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Berling landings" title="">[42]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a> support was negligible.<sup id="_ref-Berling landings_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Berling landings" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>

Due to a lack of cooperation and often the active aggressive moves on the part of the Soviets and several other factors, the Warsaw Uprising and Operation Tempest failed in their primary goal: to free part of the Polish territories so that a government loyal to the <a href="/wiki/Polish_government-in-exile" id="w">Polish government-in-exile</a> could be established there instead of a Soviet <a href="/wiki/Puppet_state" id="w">puppet state</a>. There is no consensus among historians as to whether that was ever possible, or whether those operations had any other lasting effect. Some argue that without Operation Tempest and the Warsaw Uprising, Poland would have ended as a Soviet republic, a fate definitely worse than that of an &#34;independent&#34; puppet state, and thus the Operation succeeded at least partially in being a political demonstration to the Soviets and Western Allies.{{Fact}} In addition, the Warsaw Uprising compelled the Soviets to stop their offensive in Poland to let the Germans suppress the uprising.

Among those were the leaders of the uprising: <a href="/wiki/Tadeusz_B%C3%B3r-Komorowski" id="w">Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski</a> and <a href="/wiki/Antoni_Chru%C5%9Bciel" id="w">Antoni Chru≈õciel</a> (in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> and the United States, respectively).</p>
<p>Factual knowledge of the Warsaw Uprising, inconvenient to Stalin, was twisted by propaganda of the <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Republic_of_Poland" id="w">People&#39;s Republic of Poland</a>, which stressed the failings of the Home Army and the Polish government-in-exile, and forbade all criticism of the Red Army or the political goals of Soviet strategy.<sup id="_ref-Sawicki_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sawicki" title="">[59]</a></sup> Until the late <a href="/wiki/1960s" id="w">sixties</a> the very name of the Home Army was censored, and most films and novels covering the 1944 Uprising were either banned or modified so that the name of the Home Army did not appear.<sup id="_ref-Sawicki_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sawicki" title="">[59]</a></sup> Further, the official propaganda of both communist Poland and the <a href="/wiki/USSR" id="w">USSR</a> suggested that the Home Army was some sort of a group of right-wing collaborators with Nazi Germany. From 1956 on, the image of the Warsaw Uprising in Polish propaganda was changed a little bit to underline that the soldiers were indeed brave, while the officers were treacherous and the commanders were characterised by disregard of the losses.<sup id="_ref-Sawicki_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sawicki" title="">[59]</a></sup> The first serious publications on the topic were not issued until the late <a href="/wiki/1980s" id="w">eighties</a>. In Warsaw no monument to the Home Army could be built until 1989. Instead, efforts of the Soviet-backed <a href="/wiki/Armia_Ludowa" id="w">Armia Ludowa</a> were glorified and exaggerated.

In the West, the story of the Polish fight for Warsaw with little support was an embarrassment, as was the shock of Home Army soldiers as Western Allies recognised the Soviet controlled pro-Communist regime installed by Stalin; as a result, the story was not publicised for many years.</p>
<p>The courage of soldiers and civilians involved in the Warsaw Uprising, and its betrayal by the Soviet Union, contributed to keeping anti-Soviet sentiment in Poland at a high level throughout the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" id="w">Cold War</a>. Memories of the Uprising helped to inspire the Polish labour movement <a href="/wiki/Solidarity" id="w">Solidarity</a>, which led a peaceful opposition movement against the Communist government during the 1980s, leading to the downfall of that government in 1989 and the emergence of democratic political representation.</p>
<p>After <a href="/wiki/Fall_of_communism" id="w">fall of communism</a> in 1989, the censorship of the facts of the Uprising ceased, and <a href="/wiki/1_August" id="w">1 August</a> has now become a celebrated anniversary. On <a href="/wiki/1_August" id="w">1 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a>, Poland held a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Uprising. Germany and Russia were invited to the ceremony, although there was opposition to Russia&#39;s invitation. Moreover, a joke making the rounds suggested that &#34;<a href="/wiki/Yeltsin" id="w">Yeltsin</a> should be given a pair of binoculars so he can observe the ceremony from across the Vistula river.&#34; On <a href="/wiki/July_31" id="w">July 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising_Museum" id="w">Warsaw Uprising Museum</a> opened in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Research into the Warsaw Uprising has been boosted since the 1990s, particularly due to abolition of censorship and opening of state archives in Poland, however research into the lack of support of the Warsaw Uprising is (according to historians such as <a href="/wiki/Norman_Davies" id="w">Norman Davies</a>)is still very difficult due to lack of access to archives in both UK and Russia. For records related to the period, currently both the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> archives and <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russian</a> archives (where the majority of Soviet archives are kept) remain mostly closed to the public. Further complicating the matter is the United Kingdom&#39;s claim that they accidentally destroyed the archives of the <a href="/wiki/Polish_Government_in_Exile" id="w">Polish Government in Exile</a>.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
