The <b>monarchy of Canada</b>, also known as the <b>Canadian monarchy</b><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Buck1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Buck1" title="">[2]</a></sup> is a system of government in which a hereditary <a href="/wiki/Monarch" id="w">monarch</a> is the <a href="/wiki/Sovereignty" id="w">sovereign</a> of <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, holding the position of <a href="/wiki/Head_of_state" id="w">head of state</a>; the incumbent is <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Elizabeth II</a>, officially called <a href="/wiki/Style_of_the_Canadian_Sovereign" id="w">Queen of Canada</a> (<a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>: <i>Reine du Canada</i>), who has <a href="/wiki/Queen_regnant" id="w">reigned</a> since <a href="/wiki/February_6" id="w">February 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1952" id="w">1952</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Heir_apparent" id="w">heir apparent</a> is Elizabeth&#39;s eldest son, <a href="/wiki/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales" id="w">Prince Charles</a>, though the Queen is presently the only member of the <a href="/wiki/#Canadian Royal Family" id="w">Canadian Royal Family</a> with any <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Canada" id="w">constitutional</a> role. She, her husband and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Canadian_monarchs#List of Royal Consorts of Canada" id="w">consort</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh" id="w">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, Prince Charles, and other members of the Royal Family, including the Queen&#39;s other children and cousins, undertake various public ceremonial functions across Canada and on behalf of Canada abroad.</p>
<p>Most of the Queen&#39;s powers in Canada are exercised by the <a href="/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada" id="w">Governor General</a>, at present <a href="/wiki/Micha%C3%ABlle_Jean" id="w">Michaëlle Jean</a>, though the monarch does hold several powers that are hers alone. The Governor General, who maintains direct contact with the monarch,<sup id="_ref-Buck2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Buck2" title="">[3]</a></sup> is sometimes referred to as Canada&#39;s <a href="/wiki/De_facto_head_of_state" id="w">&#39;&#39;de facto&#39;&#39; head of state</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Canadian monarch, besides reigning in Canada, separately serves as <a href="/wiki/Head_of_state" id="w">head of state</a> for each of fifteen other <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth</a> countries.  This developed from the former colonial relationship of these countries to Britain, but they are now independent and the monarchy of each is legally distinct.</p>
<p>The Canadian Crown is sometimes colloquially dubbed &#34;the Maple Crown,&#34;<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> a term first coined by Governor General <a href="/wiki/Albert_Grey%2C_4th_Earl_Grey" id="w">Lord Grey</a> in 1905, when he stated about his inauguration of <a href="/wiki/Alberta" id="w">Alberta</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saskatchewan" id="w">Saskatchewan</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Telegram" id="w">telegram</a> to King <a href="/wiki/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Edward VII</a> &#34;[each one] a new leaf in Your Majesty&#39;s Maple Crown.&#34;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

The current Canadian <a href="/wiki/Monarchy" id="w">monarchy</a> can trace its ancestral lineage back to the <a href="/wiki/History_of_Anglo-Saxon_England" id="w">Anglo-Saxon</a> period, and ultimately back to the <a href="/wiki/List_of_kings_of_the_Angles" id="w">kings of the Angles</a> and the early <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland" id="w">Scottish kings</a>. Parts of the territories that today comprise Canada were claimed under King <a href="/wiki/Francis_I_of_France" id="w">Francis I</a> in 1534, while others were claimed by Queen <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England" id="w">Elizabeth I</a> in 1583; both of whom are <a href="/wiki/Blood_relative" id="w">blood relatives</a> of the current monarch. Throughout the <a href="/wiki/18th_century" id="w">18th century</a>, via war and treaties, the <a href="/wiki/New_France" id="w">Canadian colonies of France</a> were ceded to King <a href="/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George III</a>.  The <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Confederation" id="w">colonies were confederated</a> by Queen <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Victoria</a> in 1867 to form <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Monarchy" id="w">kingdom</a> in its own right,<sup id="_ref-Heritage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Heritage" title="">[7]</a></sup> and the country was proclaimed fully independent, via <a href="/wiki/Constitution_Act%2C_1982" id="w">constitutional patriation</a>, by Queen <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Elizabeth II</a> in 1982.</p>

<p>Sixteen states within the 53-member <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth of Nations</a> are in a <a href="/wiki/Personal_union" id="w">personal union</a> relationship and are known as <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_realm" id="w">Commonwealth realms</a>;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Canada is one of these.

<a id="Development_of_shared_monarchy" name="Development_of_shared_monarchy"></a><h3>Development of shared monarchy</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1926" id="w">Balfour Declaration of 1926</a> provided the <a href="/wiki/Dominion" id="w">Dominions</a> the right to be considered equal to Britain, rather than subordinate; an agreement that had the result of a shared Crown that operates independently in each realm rather than a unitary British Crown under which all the <a href="/wiki/Dominion" id="w">Dominions</a> were secondary. The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it has often been called &#34;British&#34; since this time (in both legal and common language) for reasons historical, political, and of convenience. The <a href="/wiki/Royal_and_Parliamentary_Titles_Act%2C_1927" id="w">Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927</a> was the first indication of this shift in law, further elaborated in the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster%2C_1931" id="w">Statute of Westminster, 1931</a>.</p>
<p>Though constitutional laws governing the line of succession to the Canadian throne lie within the control of the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada" id="w">Canadian parliament</a>,<sup id="_ref-Topo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Topo" title="">[13]</a></sup> via adopting the Statute of Westminster Canada agreed not to change its rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship. This situation applies <a href="/wiki/Symmetry" id="w">symmetrically</a> in all the other realms, including the United Kingdom, a situation that has been likened to a <a href="/wiki/Treaty" id="w">treaty</a> amongst these countries.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>  Besides the two countries having symmetrical Acts of Settlement, there is no provision in Canadian law that states the King or Queen of Canada must be the same person as the King or Queen of the United Kingdom; thus, if the United Kingdom were to breach the convention set out in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster and change the line of succession to the British throne without Canada&#39;s consent, the alteraton would have no effect on the reigning sovereign of Canada or his or her heirs and successors.<sup id="_ref-Topo_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Topo" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>On all matters of the Canadian state, the monarch is advised solely by Canadian federal and provincial <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_the_Crown" id="w">Ministers of the Crown</a>.<sup id="_ref-Buck1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Buck1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Effective with the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_Act%2C_1982" id="w">Constitution Act, 1982</a>, no British or other realm government can advise the monarch on any matters pertinent to Canada.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>

<a id="Title" name="Title"></a><h3>Title</h3>
<p>{{Main}}
In Canada, the Queen&#39;s official title is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a>: <i>Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, <a href="/wiki/Head_of_the_Commonwealth" id="w">Head of the Commonwealth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Defender_of_the_Faith" id="w">Defender of the Faith</a>.</i></li>
<li>In <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>: <i>{{lang}}.</i></li></ul>
<p>This style communicates Canada&#39;s status as an independent monarchy, highlighting the sovereign&#39;s role specifically as Queen of Canada, as well as the shared aspect of the Crown throughout the realms, by mentioning Canada separately from the other countries. Typically, the sovereign is styled &#34;Queen of Canada,&#34; and is addressed as such when in Canada, or performing duties on behalf of Canada abroad.</p>
<p>Although the Queen&#39;s Canadian titles include &#34;<a href="/wiki/Defender_of_the_Faith" id="w">Defender of the Faith</a>/<i>{{lang}}</i>,&#34; neither the Queen nor any of her governors has any religious role in Canada; there have been no <a href="/wiki/Established_church" id="w">established churches</a> in Canada since before <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Confederation" id="w">confederation</a>.
{{See}}</p>
<a id="Finance" name="Finance"></a><h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Contrary to common misconception, Canadians do not pay any money to the Queen, either for personal income or to support the royal residences outside of Canada. Only when the Queen is in Canada, or acting abroad as Queen of Canada, does she draw from Canadian coffers for support in the performance of her duties. This rule applies equally to other members of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Royal_Family" id="w">Royal Family</a>.<sup id="_ref-CCC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CCC" title="">[16]</a></sup>  Usually the Queen&#39;s Canadian governments pay only for the costs associated with the Governor General and Lieutenant Governors in their exercising of the powers of the Crown on behalf of the Queen, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonial occasions, etc.<sup id="_ref-CCC_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CCC" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Provincial and federal records of expenditures associated with the Crown are kept, but no official report on the cost of the monarchy to Canadians is compiled. However, every three years the <a href="/wiki/Monarchist_League_of_Canada" id="w">Monarchist League of Canada</a> issues a survey, based on various federal and provincial government budgets, expenditures and estimates, that outlines a yearly cost for the functioning of the Crown. The 2005 survey found that the institution cost Canadians roughly $49 million in 2004.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Previous surveys found that the overall cost of the Canadian Crown was $22 million in 1999,<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> and $34 million in 2002.<sup id="_ref-CCC_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CCC" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> (This does not take into account the inflation of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Dollar" id="w">Canadian Dollar</a> over these years.)</p>
<a id="Succession" name="Succession"></a><h3>Succession</h3>

<div class="thumbcaption"><a href="/wiki/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales" id="w">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>, is the <a href="/wiki/Heir_apparent" id="w">heir apparent</a> to the Canadian Throne.</div></div>
</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Heir_apparent" id="w">heir apparent</a> is Elizabeth II&#39;s eldest son, <a href="/wiki/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales" id="w">Charles</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup>  Upon the <a href="/wiki/Demise_of_the_Crown" id="w">demise of the Crown</a> the <a href="/wiki/Queen%26%2339%3Bs_Privy_Council_for_Canada" id="w">Queen&#39;s Privy Council for Canada</a> is expected to proclaim him <a href="/wiki/Style_of_the_Canadian_Sovereign" id="w">King of Canada</a> upon his accession to the throne.</p>
<p>Succession to the throne is by <a href="/wiki/Primogeniture" id="w">male-preference primogeniture</a>, and governed by the provisions of the <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1701" id="w">Act of Settlement, 1701</a>, as well as the <a href="/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689" id="w">English Bill of Rights</a>; these documents, though originally passed by the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_England" id="w">Parliament of England</a>, are now part of Canadian constitutional law, under control of the Canadian parliament only. As such, the rules for succession are not fixed, but may be changed by a constitutional amendment.  This legislation restricts the succession to the natural (i.e. non-<a href="/wiki/Adoption" id="w">adopted</a>), legitimate descendants of <a href="/wiki/Sophia_of_Hanover" id="w">Sophia, Electress of Hanover</a> (1630–1714), a granddaughter of <a href="/wiki/James_I_of_England" id="w">James I</a>, and lays out the rules that the monarch cannot be a <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" id="w">Roman Catholic</a>, nor married to one, and must be in communion with the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" id="w">Church of England</a> upon ascending the throne, a provision that has led to an unsuccessful legal challenge, <i><a href="/wiki/O%26%2339%3BDonohue_v._Canada" id="w">O&#39;Donohue v. Canada</a></i>.  As Canada&#39;s laws governing succession are currently identical to those of the United Kingdom (by the Statute of Westminster), see <a href="/wiki/Succession_to_the_British_Throne" id="w">Succession to the British Throne</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Upon a &#34;demise in the Crown&#34; (the death of a sovereign), his or her heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony; hence arises the phrase &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_King_is_dead._Long_live_the_King!" id="w">The King is dead. Long live the King!</a>&#34; Nevertheless, it is customary for the accession of the sovereign to be publicly proclaimed by the Queen&#39;s Privy Council, which meets at <a href="/wiki/Rideau_Hall" id="w">Rideau Hall</a>. After an appropriate period of mourning has passed, the sovereign is also <a href="/wiki/Coronation_of_the_British_monarch" id="w">crowned</a> in <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Abbey" id="w">Westminster Abbey</a>, normally by the <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury" id="w">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for example, <a href="/wiki/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Edward VIII</a> was never crowned, yet was undoubtedly king during his short reign.</p>
<p>After an individual ascends the throne, he or she continues to reign until death. Monarchs are not allowed to unilaterally abdicate; the only Canadian monarch to abdicate, <a href="/wiki/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Edward VIII</a>, did so with the authorization of a special <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Parliament" id="w">Act of the Canadian Parliament</a>: the <a href="/wiki/Succession_to_the_Throne_Act" id="w">Succession to the Throne Act</a>.</p>

</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Canada" id="w">Canada&#39;s constitution</a> is made up of a variety of statutes and conventions that are either British or Canadian in origin, which gives Canada a similar parliamentary system of government to the other Commonwealth realms.  All powers of state are constitutionally reposed in the monarch,<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> who is represented at the federal level by the <a href="/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada" id="w">Governor General of Canada</a> &#8211; appointed by the monarch upon the advice of the <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada" id="w">Prime Minister of Canada</a> &#8211; and at the provincial level by <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-Governor_(Canada)" id="w">Lieutenant Governors</a> &#8211; appointed by the Governor General upon the advice of the Prime Minister, usually in consultation with the relevant provincial premier;<sup id="_ref-McCullough_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McCullough" title="">[22]</a></sup> the monarch is informed of the Prime Minister&#39;s decision before the Governor General gives <a href="/wiki/Royal_Assent" id="w">Royal Assent</a>.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Most of the Queen&#39;s domestic duties are performed by these <a href="/wiki/Viceroy" id="w">vice-regal</a> representatives.</p>
<p>As all executive authority is vested in the sovereign, the institutions of government are said to act under her authority; hence, the government of Canada is formally referred to as <i>Her Majesty&#39;s Government in Canada</i>,<sup id="_ref-US_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US" title="">[24]</a></sup> however, since the early 1970s, though the constitutional arrangements have not changed, the government is more often addressed simply as &#34;The <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Canada" id="w">Government of Canada</a>.&#34;  As such, the constitution instructs that any change to the position of the monarch, or the monarch&#39;s representatives in Canada, requires the consent of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Senate" id="w">Senate</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons" id="w">House of Commons</a>, and the legislative assemblies of all the provinces.</p>
<a id="Constitutional_duties" name="Constitutional_duties"></a><h3>Constitutional duties</h3>
<p>The role of the Queen and the Governor General is both legal and practical; the Crown is regarded as a corporation, in which several parts share the authority of the whole, with the Queen as the person at the centre of the constitutional construct.<sup id="_ref-Murdoch_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Murdoch" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>The vast powers that belong to the Crown, collectively known as the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Prerogative" id="w">Royal Prerogative</a>, include many powers, such as the ability to make treaties and send <a href="/wiki/Ambassador" id="w">ambassadors</a> and include certain duties, such as defense the realm and to maintenance of the <a href="/wiki/Queen%26%2339%3Bs_peace" id="w">Queen&#39;s peace</a>. Parliamentary approval is not required for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative; moreover, the consent of the Crown must be obtained before either of the Houses of Parliament may even debate a bill affecting the sovereign&#39;s prerogatives or interests.  It is important to note that the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown, and not to any of the ministers, though it may sometimes appear that way.<sup id="_ref-Murdoch_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Murdoch" title="">[25]</a></sup> Although the Royal Prerogative is extensive, it is not unlimited. For example, the monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorization of an <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Parliament" id="w">Act of Parliament</a>.</p>
<p>The Crown appoints a prime minister, who advises the monarch and Governor General on how to execute their executive powers. In accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions, the monarch or Governor General must appoint the individual most likely to maintain the support of the House of Commons: usually, the leader of the party with a majority in that house. In a parliament in which no party or coalition holds a majority, the Crown is required, by convention, to appoint the individual most likely to command the support of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons" id="w">House of Commons</a>, usually, but not necessarily, the leader of the largest party. Thus, for example, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Martin" id="w">Paul Martin</a> remained Prime Minister for over a year after the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2004" id="w">2004 election</a>, even though his party did not command a majority in the commons. Situations can arise in which the Governor General&#39;s judgement about the most suitable leader to be Prime Minister has to be brought into play.<sup id="_ref-GG_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GG" title="">[26]</a></sup>  The Queen is informed by the Governor General of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearing-in of a new prime minister and members of the ministry.<sup id="_ref-GG_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GG" title="">[26]</a></sup>
{{rquote}}</p>
<p>It is a duty of the Crown to also appoint and dismiss ministers, members of various executive agencies, and other officials. The appointment of <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-Governor_(Canada)" id="w">lieutenant governors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Queen%26%2339%3Bs_Privy_Council_for_Canada" id="w">Privy Councillors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Senate" id="w">Senators</a>, the Speaker of the Senate, <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada" id="w">Supreme Court</a> justices, and <a href="/wiki/Superior_court" id="w">Superior</a> and County Court judges in each province, also falls under the Royal Prerogative, though these duties are specifically assigned to the Governor General by the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_Act%2C_1867" id="w">Constitution Act, 1867</a>, save for the appointment of judges to the Courts of Probate in <a href="/wiki/Nova_Scotia" id="w">Nova Scotia</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_Brunswick" id="w">New Brunswick</a>. Effectively, however, the appointees are chosen by the Prime Minister, or, for less important offices, by other ministers.  The lieutenant governors are also specifically delegated to appoint under the Great Seal of the Province, the Attorney General, the Secretary and Registrar of the Province, the Treasurer of the Province, the Commissioner of <a href="/wiki/Crown_land" id="w">Crown Lands</a>, and the Commissioner of Agriculture and Public Works, and in the Case of Quebec the Solicitor General.</p>
<p>In addition, it is the Crown&#39;s prerogative to declare war, make peace, and direct the actions of the military, although the Prime Minister holds <i>de facto</i> decision-making power over the armed forces.  The Royal Prerogative also extends to foreign affairs: the sovereign or Governor General may negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements; no parliamentary approval is required. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of Canada; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The Governor General, on behalf of the Queen, also accredits Canadian <a href="/wiki/High_Commissioner" id="w">High Commissioners</a> and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states.

The sovereign is one of the three components of <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada" id="w">parliament</a>; the others are the <a href="/wiki/Senate_of_Canada" id="w">Senate</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons" id="w">House of Commons</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Constitution_Act%2C_1867" id="w">Constitution Act, 1867</a>, also outlines that the Governor General alone is responsible for summoning the House of Commons, though it remains the monarch&#39;s prerogative to <a href="/wiki/Prorogation" id="w">prorogue</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dissolution_of_Parliament" id="w">dissolve</a> parliament. The new parliamentary session is marked by the <a href="/wiki/State_Opening_of_Parliament" id="w">State Opening of Parliament</a>, during which either the monarch or the Governor General reads the <a href="/wiki/Speech_from_the_Throne" id="w">Speech from the Throne</a> in the Senate Chamber, outlining the Government&#39;s legislative agenda. A general election follows dissolution, the <a href="/wiki/Writ_of_election" id="w">writs for which</a> are <a href="/wiki/Dropping_the_writ" id="w">dropped by the Governor General</a> at <a href="/wiki/Rideau_Hall" id="w">Rideau Hall</a>.</p>
<p>There are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by, or bills that require assent by, the Queen. These include signing the appointment papers of Governors General, the confirmation of awards of <a href="/wiki/Orders%2C_decorations%2C_and_medals_of_Canada" id="w">Canadian honours</a>, and the approval of any change in her Canadian title.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> On occasion the monarch must personally act directly in <a href="/wiki/Partisan_(political)" id="w">partisan</a> affairs. For example, this occurred when Queen Elizabeth II expanded the number of Senate seats to assure passage of the <a href="/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(Canada)" id="w">GST</a>.</p>
<p>In the last example, the Queen performed this task on the advice of Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Brian_Mulroney" id="w">Brian Mulroney</a>, illustrating that because the Canadian monarchy is a constitutional one, the powers that are constitutionally the monarch&#39;s are exercised almost wholly upon the advice of the <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada" id="w">Prime Minister</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_the_Crown" id="w">Ministers of the Crown</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_of_Canada" id="w">Cabinet</a>, who are, in turn, accountable to the democratically elected House of Commons, and through it, to the people. It has been said since the death of <a href="/wiki/Anne_of_Great_Britain" id="w">Queen Anne</a> in 1714, the last monarch to head the British cabinet (when almost all of Canada was still French colonial territory), that the monarch <i>reigns</i> but does not <i>rule</i>. In Canada, this has been true since the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)" id="w">Treaty of Paris (1763)</a> ended the reign of Canada&#39;s last absolute monarch, King <a href="/wiki/Louis_XV_of_France" id="w">Louis XV of France</a>.  This means that the monarch&#39;s role, and thereby the Vice-regent&#39;s role, is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments and agencies operate.  The Queen is fully briefed through regular communications from her Canadian ministers, and holds audience with them where possible.<sup id="_ref-Buck2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Buck2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In exceptional circumstances, however, the monarch or vice-regal representative can act against such advice based upon his or her <a href="/wiki/Reserve_power" id="w">reserve powers</a><sup id="_ref-Murdoch_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Murdoch" title="">[25]</a></sup> &#8211; as when Governor General <a href="/wiki/Baron_Byng" id="w">Julian Byng</a> refused a request by Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/W.L._Mackenzie_King" id="w">William Mackenzie King</a> for a dissolution of Parliament and call for new elections, resulting in the <a href="/wiki/King-Byng_Affair" id="w">King-Byng Affair</a>.

<p>Across the country the Crown is unitary. Under this system the <a href="/wiki/Head_of_State" id="w">headship of state</a> is not a part of either the federal or provincial jurisdictions; the Queen reigns impartially over the country as a whole; meaning the <a href="/wiki/Sovereignty" id="w">sovereignty</a> of the provinces is passed on not by the Governor General or the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada" id="w">Canadian parliament</a>, but through the Crown itself.  This means that, though unitary, the Crown is &#34;divided&#34; into eleven legal jurisdictions; into eleven &#34;crowns&#34; &#8211; one federal and ten provincial.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup>  The <a href="/wiki/Category:Fathers_of_Confederation" id="w">Fathers of Confederation</a> viewed this system of constitutional monarchy as a bulkwark against any potential fracturing of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_confederation" id="w">Canadian federation</a>.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-Governor_(Canada)" id="w">Lieutenant Governor</a> serves as the Queen&#39;s representative in each province, carrying out all the monarch&#39;s constitutional and ceremonial duties of state on her behalf.

<a id="Legal_role" name="Legal_role"></a><h2>Legal role</h2>
<p>All laws in Canada are enacted with the sovereign&#39;s, or the viceroy&#39;s signature, though there is some debate{{Who}} over whether the monarch is constitutionally allowed to personally grant Royal Assent to provincial bills.  Thus, all federal bills begin with the phrase &#34;Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows.&#34;<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>  The granting of a signature to a bill is known as <a href="/wiki/Royal_Assent" id="w">Royal Assent</a>; it, and proclamation, are required for all acts of parliament and of the provincial legislatures, usually granted or withheld by the Governor General or Lieutenant Governor, with the <a href="/wiki/Great_Seal_of_Canada" id="w">Great Seal of Canada</a>, or the appropriate provincial seal. The Governor General may reserve a bill for the monarch&#39;s pleasure, that is to say, allow the monarch to make a personal decision on the bill. A Lieutenant Governor of a province may similarly defer to the Governor General (who may in turn defer to the monarch). The monarch has the power to disallow any bill, within a time limit specified by the Constitution. Recently activists opposed to <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Canada" id="w">Bill C-38</a> lobbied Queen Elizabeth II to disallow the legislation after it was passed by parliament.

The sovereign is deemed the &#34;fount of justice,&#34; and is responsible for rendering justice for all subjects; however, he or she does not personally rule in judicial cases. Instead, judicial functions are performed in his or her name.  Hence, the common law holds that the sovereign &#34;can do no wrong&#34;; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences.  Civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government) are permitted; however, lawsuits against the monarch personally are not cognizable. In international cases, as a <a href="/wiki/Sovereignty" id="w">sovereign</a> and under established principles of <a href="/wiki/International_law" id="w">international law</a>, the Queen of Canada is not subject to suit in foreign courts without her express consent.<sup id="_ref-US_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US" title="">[24]</a></sup> The sovereign, and by extension the Governor General, also exercises the &#34;prerogative of mercy,&#34; and may pardon offences against the Crown. Pardons may be awarded before, during, or after a trial.</p>
<p>In addition, the monarch also serves as a symbol of the legitimacy of courts of justice, and of their judicial authority. An image of the Queen or the <a href="/wiki/Coat_of_Arms_of_Canada" id="w">Arms of Her Majesty in Right of Canada</a> is always displayed in Canadian courtrooms; exceptions are the courts of <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" id="w">Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador</a>, and some of the courts of Ontario, where the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Arms of Her Majesty in Right of the United Kingdom</a> are displayed as a symbol of the judiciary.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Itinerant" id="w">Itinerant</a> judges will display an image of the Queen and the Canadian flag when holding a session away from established courtrooms; such situations occur in parts of Canada where the stakeholders in a given court case are too isolated geographically to be able to travel for regular proceedings.</p>
<p>In Canada the legal personality of the <a href="/wiki/State" id="w">state</a> is referred to as &#34;Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada&#34; (French: <i>Sa Majesté la Reine du chef du Canada</i>), and likewise for the provinces and territories (i.e., &#34;in Right of Ontario,&#34; etc.).<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> For example, if a lawsuit is filed against the federal government, the respondent is formally described as Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. Likewise, in a case in which a party sues both the province of <a href="/wiki/Saskatchewan" id="w">Saskatchewan</a> and the federal government, the respondents would formally be called &#34;Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Saskatchewan&#34; and &#34;Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.&#34;<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> In this capacity, all <a href="/wiki/Crown_copyright" id="w">Crown copyright</a> is held by the Queen, either in Right of Canada or of a relevant province.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada" id="w">Supreme Court of Canada</a> found in the 1980 case Attorney General of Quebec v. Labrecque that <a href="/wiki/Civil_service" id="w">civil servants</a> in Canada are not contracted by an abstraction called &#34;the <a href="/wiki/State" id="w">state</a>,&#34; but rather they are employed by the monarch, who personifies the state (see below) and &#34;enjoys a general capacity to contract in accordance with the rule of ordinary law.&#34;<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup>  This situation is similar for the governors, judges, members of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Forces" id="w">Canadian Forces</a>, <a href="/wiki/Police" id="w">police</a> officers, and <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada" id="w">parliamentarians</a>, who all technically work for the monarch.

<p>Apart from Canada, the Queen and other members of the Royal Family regularly perform public duties in the other fifteen nations of the Commonwealth in which the Queen is head of state (see, for example, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Commonwealth_visits_made_by_Queen_Elizabeth_II" id="w">List of Commonwealth visits made by Queen Elizabeth II</a>).

<p>Monarchical symbols in Canada were originally identical to those in the United Kingdom, having been imported from there to all parts of the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">Empire</a>.  As the country incrementally gained independence from the UK, more and more distinctly Canadian elements were added to certain symbols associated with the Crown.  Into the 1970s and 1980s, some royally connected icons were removed or replaced as <a href="/wiki/National_symbols_of_Canada" id="w">national symbols</a>, such as the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Red_Ensign" id="w">Red Ensign</a>, which contained the <a href="/wiki/Union_Flag" id="w">Royal Union Flag</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Flag_terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms" id="w">canton</a>, being replaced with the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Canada" id="w">Maple Leaf flag</a>. The Crown remains a visible part of the everyday lives of Canadians, with symbols specifially of the monarch of Canada, or loyalty thereto.</p>

Certain key days are also reserved to celebrate the monarchy, notably <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Day" id="w">Victoria Day</a> &#8211; the holiday for celebrating the reigning sovereign&#39;s birthday <sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> &#8211; and the day of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Christmas_Message" id="w">Royal Christmas Message</a>, broadcast to the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth of Nations</a> since 1932.</p>
<p>There are also hundreds of places named for Canadian monarchs and members of the Royal Family all across Canada.  No individual has been more honoured than Queen <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Victoria</a> in the names of Canada&#39;s public buildings, streets, populated places and physical features.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup>

Members of the Royal Family have been present in Canada since the late <a href="/wiki/1700s" id="w">1700s</a>, either on military maneuvers, for official tours, the vice-regal representative of the British, and later Canadian monarch. Though all of the Royal Family currently lives outside of the country, members are still regular visitors, enough so that on occasion <a href="/wiki/Royal_tours_of_Canada" id="w">royal visits to Canada</a> are also referred to by <a href="/wiki/Monarchism_in_Canada" id="w">monarchists</a> as &#34;Royal Homecomings.&#34; These events are often marked with a variety of ceremonies, the granting of honours, and general celebrations, even though these events are not always official holidays.</p>
<p>The Queen regularly undertakes tours of Canada to celebrate <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_Canada" id="w">Canadian culture</a>, milestone anniversaries, military remembrances, and the like. Other royals will perform the same tasks in the Queen&#39;s place, from time to time, usually on a less grand scale or for events of a lesser importance. These tours are at the invitation of, organized, and paid for by the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Canada" id="w">Canadian government</a>, provincial government, or a combination of both; hence, they are called &#34;official tours&#34; or &#34;official visits.&#34;<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>

<p>The first French and British colonizers of Canada interpreted the hereditary nature of some indigenous <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North American</a> chieftainships as a form of monarchy, often referring to these leaders as kings and their lands as kingdoms.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> There is also evidence that the aboriginals had a similar understanding of monarchy, most notably in the legend of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Saguenay" id="w">Kingdom of Saguenay</a>, and tales of &#34;wealthy kingdoms in the north&#34; told by <a href="/wiki/Iroquois" id="w">Iroquoians</a> to <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Cartier" id="w">Jacques Cartier</a> in 1534.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>Canada has been the territory of a monarchy, or a monarchy in its own right, since the establishment of <a href="/wiki/New_France" id="w">New France</a>. Territory of the <a href="/wiki/List_of_French_monarchs" id="w">French Crown</a> was merged with the North American colonies under the <a href="/wiki/British_monarchy" id="w">British Crown</a> through the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)" id="w">Treaty of Paris</a> in <a href="/wiki/1763" id="w">1763</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1867" id="w">1867</a>, Canada became a self-governing <a href="/wiki/Dominion" id="w">Dominion</a> under the British Crown (originally intended to be named the <a href="/wiki/Canada%26%2339%3Bs_name#Adoption of Dominion" id="w">Kingdom of Canada</a>), and, from that date to the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982, Canada developed into a kingdom in its own right. Thus, kings and queens reigning over Canada have included the <a href="/wiki/List_of_French_monarchs" id="w">monarchs of France</a> (from <a href="/wiki/Francis_I_of_France" id="w">Francis I</a> in 1534 to <a href="/wiki/Louis_XV_of_France" id="w">Louis XV</a> in 1763), <a href="/wiki/List_of_British_monarchs" id="w">those of the UK</a> (from <a href="/wiki/Anne_of_Great_Britain" id="w">Anne of Great Britain</a> in 1713 to <a href="/wiki/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">King George VI</a> in 1952), to <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Elizabeth II</a> as Queen of Canada today.</p>
<p>Canada&#39;s emergence as a sovereign constitutional monarchy after 1931 was demonstrated in the abdication of <a href="/wiki/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">King Edward VIII</a> in 1936; when Canada had to pass its own <a href="/wiki/Succession_to_the_Throne_Act" id="w">Succession to the Throne Act</a>, which effected changes to the rules of succession in Canada so that they matched those within the other realms of the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">British Commonwealth</a>.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup>  A few years later, Canada&#39;s new status was again demonstrated when King <a href="/wiki/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George VI</a> and Queen <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Bowes-Lyon" id="w">Elizabeth</a> travelled from Canada into the United States as King and Queen of Canada.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup>  The <a href="/wiki/Constitution_Act_of_1982" id="w">Constitution Act of 1982</a> was said to have entrenched the monarchy in Canada, due to the stringent requirements, as laid out in the amending formula, that must be met to alter the monarchy in any way.</p>
<p>Continuing the tradition started in the early 1800s, throughout the 20th century members of the Royal Family coninued to tour the country, as the viceroy and/or to mark key events.  A milestone was reached in 1939, when King <a href="/wiki/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George VI</a> became the first reigning monarch to tour Canada, as well as to visit the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> as King of Canada.  As ease of travel increased, visits by the sovereign and/or Royal Family members became more and more frequent, seeing the Queen Elizabeth II officiate at such important moments as the opening of the <a href="/wiki/Saint_Lawrence_Seaway" id="w">Saint Lawrence Seaway</a> in <a href="/wiki/1959_in_Canada" id="w">1959</a>; the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Centennial" id="w">Canadian Centennial</a> in <a href="/wiki/1967_in_Canada" id="w">1967</a>; the opening of the <a href="/wiki/1976_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1976 Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Montreal" id="w">Montreal</a>; the <a href="/wiki/Patriation" id="w">patriation</a> of the Constitution in <a href="/wiki/1982_in_Canada" id="w">1982</a>, the 500th anniversary, in <a href="/wiki/1997_in_Canada" id="w">1997</a>, of <a href="/wiki/John_Cabot" id="w">Cabot&#39;s</a> landing at <a href="/wiki/Bonavista%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" id="w">Bonavista</a>; and more.  However, through the 1960s and 1970s, the rise of <a href="/wiki/Quebec_nationalism" id="w">Quebec nationalism</a> and changes in Canadian identity created an atmosphere where the purpose and role of the monarchy <a href="/wiki/Debate_on_the_Canadian_monarchy" id="w">came into question</a>. Some references to the monarch and the monarchy were slowly removed from the public eye, and moves were made by the federal government to constitutionally alter the monarchy&#39;s place and role in Canada, though the system has remained essentially the same.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1999, it was reported in the media that the federal government was considering the idea of changing Canada to a <a href="/wiki/Republic" id="w">republic</a>, news that drew some negative reaction, and denial by the then Prime Minister. A survey of the provincial premiers at the time showed only one in favour of such a move.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup>  Soon after, the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II" id="w">Queen&#39;s Golden Jubilee</a> took place in 2002, celebrating Elizabeth II&#39;s fifty years as Queen of Canada; the concurrent country-wide tour by the sovereign and her <a href="/wiki/List_of_Canadian_monarchs#List of Royal Consorts of Canada" id="w">consort</a>, and the attendant <a href="/wiki/F%C3%AAte" id="w">fêtes</a>, proved popular with Canadians. </p>

<p>The <b>Canadian Royal Family</b> is a group of people closely related to the monarch of Canada;<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> it is a non-resident royal family, as those who comprise the group live predominantly in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>; some members have lived in Canada for extended periods as <a href="/wiki/Viceroy" id="w">viceroy</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Cambridge%2C_1st_Earl_of_Athlone" id="w">Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone</a>. Members often perform ceremonial and social duties but, aside from the monarch, have no role in the affairs of government.  Those who comprise the Royal Family carry the <a href="/wiki/Style_(manner_of_address)" id="w">style</a> <a href="/wiki/Majesty" id="w">His or Her Majesty</a> (HM), <a href="/wiki/Royal_Highness" id="w">His or Her Royal Highness</a> (HRH), or sometimes <a href="/wiki/The_Right_Honourable" id="w">The Right Honourable</a> (in <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>: <i>Sa Majesté</i> (SM), <i>Son Altesse Royale</i> (SAR), and <i>Le très honorable</i>).</p>
<p>It has been stated by the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.crht.ca/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.crht.ca/">Canadian Royal Heritage Trust</a> that <a href="/wiki/Prince_Edward_Augustus%2C_Duke_of_Kent_and_Strathearn" id="w">Prince Edward, Duke of Kent</a>, due to his having lived in Canada between 1791 and 1800, and his being father of Queen <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Victoria</a>, is &#34;the ancestor of the modern Canadian Royal Family.&#34;<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup>  However, the concept of the Canadian Royal Family did not emerge until after the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931. Though the act came into effect during the reign of King <a href="/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George V</a>, Canadian officials only began to overtly consider putting the principles of Canada&#39;s new status as an independent <a href="/wiki/Monarchy" id="w">kingdom</a> into effect during the late <a href="/wiki/1930s" id="w">1930s</a>.<sup id="_ref-Parl_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Parl" title="">[62]</a></sup> At first, the monarch was the only member of the Royal Family to carry out public ceremonial duties solely on the advice of Canadian ministers; King <a href="/wiki/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Edward VIII</a> became the first to do so when he dedicated the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_National_Vimy_Memorial" id="w">Vimy Memorial</a> in July, <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a> &#8211; one of his few obligations performed during his short reign.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> Over the decades, however, the monarch&#39;s children, grandchildren, cousins, and their respective <a href="/wiki/Spouse" id="w">spouses</a> began to perform functions at the direction of the Canadian government, representing the monarch within Canada or abroad.</p>
<p>Despite the length of service, it was not until October 2002, when the term &#34;Canadian Royal Family&#34; was first used publicly and officially by a member of it: in a speech given to the <a href="/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Nunavut" id="w">Nunavut legislature</a> at its opening, Queen Elizabeth II stated: &#34;I am proud to be the first member of the Canadian Royal Family to be greeted in Canada&#39;s newest territory.&#34;<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup>  Still, the Canadian media often still refers to the Royal Family as the &#34;British Royal Family.&#34;<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>

Queen Elizabeth II is the head of the Royal Family; her family is considered Canada&#39;s Royal Family.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> Those in the direct line of succession owe their allegiance to Elizabeth II specifically as the Queen of Canada,<sup id="_ref-Noonan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Noonan" title="">[68]</a></sup> and, according to the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_National_Defence_and_the_Canadian_Forces" id="w">Department of National Defence</a>, members of the family who bear the style &#34;Royal Highness&#34; are subjects specifically of the Canadian monarch,<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup>  They are entitled to <a href="/wiki/Diplomatic_missions_of_Canada" id="w">Canadian consular assistance</a> and to the protection of the Queen&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Forces" id="w">armed forces of Canada</a> when they are outside of the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_realm" id="w">Commonwealth realms</a>, and in need of protection or aid.<sup id="_ref-Noonan_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Noonan" title="">[68]</a></sup> Their position as subjects but not citizens of Canada is reflected in the confusion that arises around the awarding of honours to members of the Royal Family; for example, the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_Canada" id="w">Order of Canada</a> bestowed upon <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Bowes-Lyon" id="w">the Queen Mother</a> was only honorary, though the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Forces_Decoration" id="w">Canadian Forces Decoration</a> awarded to her was not.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>

<p>Unlike in the United Kingdom, in Canada the sovereign is the only member of the Royal Family who has a title established through law. Though it would be possible for other members of the Royal Family to be granted distinctly Canadian titles (as is the case for the <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Rothesay" id="w">Duke of Rothesay</a> in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>), they have always been, and continue to only be accorded the use of a <a href="/wiki/Courtesy_title" id="w">courtesy title</a>, which is the style they have been granted via <a href="/wiki/Letters_Patent" id="w">Letters Patent</a> in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>However, in Canada these styles are also translated to <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>. The most senior members of the Royal Family are styled as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<p>The popularity of the Royal Family with Canadians, as well as individual members of it, has fluctuated over the years. Mirroring the mood in the United Kingdom, the family&#39;s lowest approval was during the mid <a href="/wiki/1980s" id="w">1980s</a> to <a href="/wiki/1990s" id="w">1990s</a> when the children of the monarch were enduring their <a href="/wiki/Divorce" id="w">divorces</a>, and were the targets of negative <a href="/wiki/Tabloid" id="w">tabloid</a> reporting. Some recent poll results follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>An <a href="/wiki/EKOS" id="w">EKOS</a> Poll conducted in May 2002, concluded that 35% of Canadians found the Royal Family boring, 52% saw them as interesting, with 12% stating neither. 44% said they were irrelevant, 46% said the opposite, and 8% said neither. 59% saw the Royal Family as tired, 22% deemed them vibrant, and 17% put them at neither.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup></li>
<li>A March 2005, <a href="/wiki/Decima_Research" id="w">Decima Research</a> Poll found some interesting support levels for members of the Royal Family. 71% of Canadians had a favourable impression of the Royal Family. Only 20% had an unfavourable impression of the Royal Family.

<p>The aforementioned residences belong to the Crown; they are held in trust for future rulers, and cannot be sold by the monarch.

<p>Besides government and military institutions, a number of Canadian civilian organizations have associations with the monarchy, either through their being founded via a Royal Charter, or because at least one member of the Royal Family serves as a patron.</p>
<a id="Organizations_under_Royal_Charter" name="Organizations_under_Royal_Charter"></a><h3>Organizations under Royal Charter</h3>
<p>{{Main}}
A <a href="/wiki/Royal_Charter" id="w">Royal Charter</a> is granted by the monarch on the advice of the <a href="/wiki/Queen%26%2339%3Bs_Privy_Council_for_Canada" id="w">Queen&#39;s Privy Council for Canada</a>, which creates or gives special status to an incorporated body. This is an exercise of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Prerogative" id="w">Royal Prerogative</a>, and, in Canada, there are hundreds of organizations under Royal Charters. Such organizations include charities, businesses, colleges, universities, and cities.  Today, it is mostly charities and professional institutions who receive Royal Charters.</p>
<p>Examples of organizations under Royal Charter are: the <a href="/wiki/Hudson%26%2339%3Bs_Bay_Company" id="w">Hudson&#39;s Bay Company</a>, founded by Royal Charter issued by King <a href="/wiki/Charles_II_of_England" id="w">Charles II</a> in <a href="/wiki/1670" id="w">1670</a>;<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Saint_John%2C_New_Brunswick" id="w">Saint John, New Brunswick</a>, receiving its charter in 1786 from King <a href="/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George III</a>;<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/McGill_University" id="w">McGill University</a>, which received a Royal Charter from King <a href="/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George IV</a> in <a href="/wiki/1821" id="w">1821</a>.</p>

Until <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" id="w">modern industrial</a> times, all development of the <a href="/wiki/Science" id="w">sciences</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Art" id="w">arts</a> were under the direct control of the monarch, exercised by the foundation of <a href="/wiki/College" id="w">colleges</a> that today form the basis of modern <a href="/wiki/Universities" id="w">universities</a>. The endowments to provide for these colleges were established by <a href="/wiki/The_Crown" id="w">the Crown</a> to further education in both ecclesiastical and <a href="/wiki/Secularism" id="w">secular</a> matters.</p>
<p>As time progressed, the educated members of these organizations formed into groups to lecture, demonstrate and <a href="/wiki/Debate" id="w">debate</a> their various subjects. These groups either sought royal patronage, or were created as <a href="/wiki/Memorial" id="w">memorials</a> for the predecessors of the reigning monarch. Other colleges and foundations have been endowed by the owners of the great <a href="/wiki/Estate_(law)" id="w">landed estates</a> and, in later times, by industrialists and finally modern <a href="/wiki/Corporation" id="w">corporate bodies</a>.  However, even in present times, relatively new organizations still seek royal patronage, though it is a ceremonial function wherein the royal will either volunteer their time for service or make a charitable donation.  To receive royal patronage, an organization must prove to be long lasting.

<a id="Debate" name="Debate"></a><h2>Debate</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>To date, there has been little national debate about ending the monarchy in Canada, in contrast to some other <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_realm" id="w">Commonwealth realms</a> where the issue has gained a relatively higher profile.  Many Canadians continue to be unaware that the Queen serves as their head of state; a 2002 <a href="/wiki/EKOS_Research_Associates" id="w">EKOS</a> poll found that only five percent of Canadians could correctly identify Elizabeth II as Canada&#39;s head of state (the majority believing it to be the Prime Minister).<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup></p>
<p>Where debate does exist, it tends to be a largely academic one, and several books have been written that explore the subject from a <a href="/wiki/Political_science" id="w">political science</a> perspective. Neither of Canada&#39;s two main political parties, the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" id="w">Liberal Party</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada" id="w">Conservative Party</a>, are officially in favour of abolishing the monarchy; though the latter makes support for constitutional monarchy a founding principle in its policy declaration.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/New_Democratic_Party" id="w">New Democratic Party</a> (NDP) has no official position on the role of the monarchy. Unlike other Commonwealth realms, Canada has never had a head of government who has been openly republican.  Some politicians, having pledged allegiance to the Queen, have occasionally publicly voiced their opinion on the matter, following former-<a href="/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Canada" id="w">Deputy Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Manley_(politician)" id="w">John Manley</a>&#39;s 2002 statement that he was in favour of abolishing the monarchy &#8211; later stating that it was his personal opinion.</p>
<p>The one province that has shown significant republican sentiment is <a href="/wiki/Quebec" id="w">Quebec</a>; the <i><a href="/wiki/Parti_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois" id="w">Parti Québécois</a></i> has at times expressed hostility to the institution of the monarchy. However, as the party views <a href="/wiki/Quebec_sovereignty" id="w">Quebec sovereignty</a> as a more pressing concern, and sees the Crown as a purely federal institution (despite the existence of the <a href="/wiki/Monarchy_in_Quebec" id="w">Crown in Right of Quebec</a>), it has recently tended to decline comment on the issue. </p>
<p>Canada has two special-interest groups representing both sides of the debate, who frequently argue the issue in the media: <a href="/wiki/Monarchist_League_of_Canada" id="w">Monarchist League of Canada</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Citizens_for_a_Canadian_Republic" id="w">Citizens for a Canadian Republic</a>.</p>
