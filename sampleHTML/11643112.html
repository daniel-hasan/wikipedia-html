<a id="Life" name="Life"></a><h1> Life </h1>
<p>Oleh Lysheha was born in 1949 to a family of teachers in <a href="/wiki/Tysmenytsia" id="w">Tysmenytsia</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains" id="w">Carpathian</a> village in <a href="/wiki/Ivano-Frankivsk_Oblast" id="w">Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" id="w">Ukraine</a>.<sup id="_ref-piw_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-piw" title="">[1]</a></sup>  Twenty years later, Lysheha became a student studying foreign languages at the university in <a href="/wiki/Lviv" id="w">Lviv</a> named after the renowned Ukrainian poet <a href="/wiki/Ivan_Franko" id="w">Ivan Franko</a>.  In 1972, Lysheha was expelled and drafted to the Soviet army for membership in <i>Lviv Bohema</i>, a dissident group of artists at Lviv University.  After serving in the military, the poet returned to his birth place, working at a local factory.<sup id="_ref-upij_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-upij" title="">[2]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>In due time, Lysheha returned to Lviv, and soon thereafter moved to <a href="/wiki/Kiev" id="w">Kiev</a> (<i>Kyiv</i>) where he married. In his position as a technical employee  at the <a href="/wiki/Kyiv_Theatrical_Institute_of_Karpenko_Karyi" id="w">Kyiv Theatrical Institute of Karpenko Karyi</a>, Lysheha continued to write poems and translate.  From 1997-1998, Oleh Lyshaha was a Visiting <a href="/wiki/Fulbright_Program" id="w">Fulbright Scholar</a> to Penn State in <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  After his return to Ukraine, the poet dove into a prolific artistic labor of poetry, painting and sculpture, as well as resumed his seasonal alteration between the capital and his birth home in the Carpathian mountains.<sup id="_ref-upij_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-upij" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Andriy Bondar describes Lysheha as the Ukrainian <a href="/wiki/Henry_Thoreau" id="w">Henry Thoreau</a> of the beginning of the 21st century:<sup id="_ref-piw_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-piw" title="">[1]</a></sup>  {{cquote}}</p>

<p>At the age of forty years old, Oleh Lysheha published his first collection of poems - &#34;Great Bridge&#34; (1989) - placing him at the forefront of the Ukrainian poetic community.  Years later, after meeting his future co-translator James Brasfield, Lysheha published &#34;The Selected Poems of Oleh Lysheha&#34; (1999) making his work available for the first time to the English reader.  A masterpiece of Ukrainian drama is Oleh Lysheha&#39;s miracle play &#34;Friend Li Po, Brother Tu Fu&#34; included in the second section of the 1999 English publication.  Thirteen years after his first work, Lysheha published &#34;To Snow and Fire&#34; (2002).<sup id="_ref-upij_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-upij" title="">[2]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Another artistic corner of Lysheha&#39;s contributions lies in the translation field.  He has translated into the <a href="/wiki/Ukrainian_language" id="w">Ukrainian language</a> works by <a href="/wiki/T._S._Eliot" id="w">T. S. Eliot</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ethra_Pound" id="w">Ethra Pound</a>.  Lysheha is also the co-author of a book of translations from Chinese, &#34;The Stories of Ancient China.&#34;</p>

<p>Literary reviewers have written that &#34;The Selected Poems of Oleh Lysheha&#34; - the English translations of Lysheha - have nothing in common with the Ukrainian poetic tradition.  As Bondar, for example, notes the poetry is &#34;influenced by natural philosophy, shamanistic meditation, total denial of a technocratic world, and escapism.&#34;<sup id="_ref-piw_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-piw" title="">[1]</a></sup>  Lyshaha&#39;s publisher <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University_Press" id="w">Harvard University Press</a> describes the poet&#39;s work as &#34;informed by transcendentalism and <a href="/wiki/Zen" id="w">Zen-like</a> introspection, with meditations on the essence of the human experience and man&#39;s place in nature.&#34;<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Whatever the style, Lysheha and Brasfield received the 2000 PEN Award for Poetry in Translation. A presentation of the award was held May 15 at the Walter Reade Theater at <a href="/wiki/Lincoln_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts" id="w">Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The poems were selected by Lysheha himself and follow the trajectory of his career.  The book is divided into three parts.  Section one holds shorter poems.  Section two &#34;is a witty, brief, three-act play mostly in prose, <i>Friend Li Po, Brother Tu Fu</i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  The third section consists of longer and more discursive narrative poems.</p>
