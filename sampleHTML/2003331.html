The <b>District of Taylor</b> is a small town in northeastern <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, located on mile 36 of the <a href="/wiki/Alaska_Highway" id="w">Alaska Highway</a>. Taylor, a member municipality of the <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_Regional_District%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Peace River Regional District</a>, covers an area of about 17&#160;km² (6&#160;mile²) with 1,380 residents.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Being just south of the much larger city of <a href="/wiki/Fort_St._John%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Fort St. John</a>, there is a sizable amount of commuting and interaction between the two.</p>
<p>The town sits on a <a href="/wiki/Terrace_deposit" id="w">plateau</a> 60 m above the north bank of the <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_(Canada)" id="w">Peace River</a>. The first settler on the flat was a trapper named Herbert Taylor in 1911. The town incorporated in 1958 with industrial business beginning to locate there. Since then Taylor has remained a small town, even though it has developed a large industrial base and has become home to the annual World&#39;s Invitational Class &#39;A&#39; Gold Panning Championships.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>The town, and the Taylor Flats upon which the town is located, are named after Herbert Taylor, a fur-trader with the <a href="/wiki/Hudson%26%2339%3Bs_Bay_Company" id="w">Hudson&#39;s Bay Company</a> who regularly met his Aboriginal trading counterparts on this river flat. In 1911 Taylor left his employers and took up residence on the flats with a few other squatters. The following year the federal government opened the area to homesteading and Taylor was granted the land upon which he had settled.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> These early settlers were trappers with the first farm established by Henry Philip, from <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" id="w">Glasgow</a>, who inherited buildings, equipment and land from his survey team when they left the area. In 1919, with the help of Taylor&#39;s nine children, along with those from a few American families who settled there, the provincial government opened the Taylor Flats School. </p>
<p>These early settlers all came to the area through the <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_Country" id="w">Peace River Country</a>, through <a href="/wiki/Grande_Prairie%2C_Alberta" id="w">Grande Prairie</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pouce_Coupe%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Pouce Coupe</a>, and across the Peace River. Some decided to settle on the steep-sloped south side of the Peace River, an area that would become known as South Taylor. To cross the river a <a href="/wiki/Cable_ferry" id="w">cable ferry</a>, which would prove to be accident-prone, was built in the 1920s but soon replaced with a motor-driven ferry. This ferry was used until 1942 when the U.S. Army came through the area building the <a href="/wiki/Alaska_Highway" id="w">Alaska Highway</a> and constructed the 2,130 foot long <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_Suspension_Bridge" id="w">Peace River Suspension Bridge</a>. The highway connected the town to a rail station in <a href="/wiki/Dawson_Creek%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Dawson Creek</a> reducing the dependence on shipping along the river. The bridge suddenly collapsed on <a href="/wiki/16_October" id="w">16 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1957" id="w">1957</a> with no injuries or fatalities.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-history_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history" title="">[4]</a></sup> A new rail trestle, from the rail extension from <a href="/wiki/Chetwynd%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Chetwynd</a> to Fort St. John, was used while constructing the replacement <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_Bridge_(British_Columbia)" id="w">Peace River Bridge</a>, which still stands today.</p>

<p>Major industrial development began in 1957, when Westcoast Energy (later <a href="/wiki/Duke_Energy" id="w">Duke Energy</a>) built the province&#39;s first gas processing plant, as well as a refinery and pipeline to <a href="/wiki/Kamloops%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Kamloops</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The community that formed around this industrial development was incorporated as a village on <a href="/wiki/23_August" id="w">23 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1958" id="w">1958</a> and soon <a href="/wiki/Canfor" id="w">Canfor</a> opened a planer mill. Meanwhile, x km (x miles) upstream, the <a href="/wiki/W.A.C._Bennett_Dam" id="w">W.A.C. Bennett Dam</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peace_Canyon_Dam" id="w">Peace Canyon Dams</a> were completed in 1966 and 1980, resepectively, which had the effect of controlling the level and flow of the Peace River water flow making navigation and flood maintenance much easier.</p>
<p>Following the construction of natural gas processing plant by Westcoast Energy in 1985, Fibreco Pulp opening its sawmill in 1988 the village to be re-incorporated into the District of Taylor in 1989. Despite the closure of the Petro-Canada refinery in 1991, economic growth continued throughout the decade as Westcoast Energy McMahon Gas Plant expanded in 1991 and added a cogeneration plant in 1993, Fibreco Pulp doubled its capacity in 1996, the Younger Natural Gas Liquids Extraction Plant (to extract water and sulphur from natural gas) was expanded in 1996, the Taylor Straddle plant (to extract ethane from natural gas) was built in 1997.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Since 1993, the town of 1,300 people have built a new hockey arena, leisure skating arena, curling rink, and 18 hole golf course. Strong community pride also developed as demonstrated by the town placing first at the provincial level, in its small category, in the parks and gardens-oriented Communities in Bloom Competition in 1997 and second in the national competition in 1998.<sup id="_ref-history_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Other local projects have included building a memorial garden and cenotaph in 2000 dedicated to the 341st Engineers of the U.S. Army corps of Engineers who were stationed on the Taylor Flats in 1942 during the construction of the Alaska Highway and the Peace River Suspension Bridge.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Canada_2001_Census" id="w">2001 Canadian census</a>, there were 1,143 people living in the municipality in 435 <a href="/wiki/Household" id="w">households</a>. Similar to the rest of the province, 51% are married and 31% are single. With 1.3% of Taylor residents being foreign-born, and 99% with an English-only mother tongue, the town has few visible minorities.
While not counted as visible minorities during the census, 100 people considered themselves to have an Aboriginal identity, about twice the provincial 4% average. With few lifestyle options and little healthcare facilities few seniors citizens live in town giving Taylor a much younger population than the rest of the province. Housing is mostly owned with only 18% of the stock being rented, half the provincial average.<sup id="_ref-statscan_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-statscan" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

The Taylor Flats, upon which the town is situated, was formed by a pre-glacial bend in the Peace River that now flows eastwards, originating in <a href="/wiki/Hudson%26%2339%3Bs_Hope%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Hudson&#39;s Hope</a> and emptying into the Artic Ocean. The terrace is approximately 60&#160;m above the north bank of the Peace River. <a href="/wiki/Escarpment" id="w">Escarpments</a> encircle the terrace and rise another 100&#160;m to the upland Peace River Prairie. The soil of the Taylor Flats have few limitations, and are rated as prime in some areas<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The soils are Rego black loam and clay loam that contain few stones or gravel and are well drained, yet hold adequate moisture for crops. There are several hundred acres of <a href="/wiki/Agricultural_Land_Reserve" id="w">Agricultural Land Reserve</a> within the municipal boundaries on both the east and west sides of the townsite. Most of the original vegatation and tree stands have been cleared but black spruce and aspen trees, and an understory of Labrador tea, bog cranberry

<p>The town has a northern, semiarid continental climate with cool, short summers and long, cold winters. However, the Taylor Flats’ microclimate, created by the south-facing terrace and the Peace River, produces more frost-free days than most of the <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_Country" id="w">Peace River Country</a>. Being in a rain shadow of the Rocky Mountains the town receives a suppressed amount of precipitation, and especially snowfall.<sup id="_ref-Saddle_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Saddle" title="">[14]</a></sup> Like the rest of the region, the town has long daylight hours in the summer and short winter daylight hours and uses <a href="/wiki/Mountain_Standard_Time" id="w">Mountain Standard Time</a> year round.</p>
<a id="Transportation_and_infrastructure" name="Transportation_and_infrastructure"></a><h2>Transportation and infrastructure</h2>
<p>Taylor&#39;s transportation network is dominated by the two-lane <a href="/wiki/Alaska_Highway" id="w">Alaska Highway</a> (<a href="/wiki/British_Columbia_Highway_97" id="w">Highway 97</a>) which runs north-south through the middle of community and provides the only road entrance and exit to the town. Intersections along the highway give access to <a href="/wiki/Frontage_road" id="w">frontage roads</a> lined with businesses and civic buildings oriented to the highway. The frontage roads also provide access to the housing behind the businesses. A wide right-of-way provides a large building setback distance from the highway and helps mitigate noise and other negative impacts of heavy traffic. In total, Taylor maintains 12 km of paved and 11 km of unpaved roads.<sup id="_ref-redbook_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-redbook" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Taylor has limited <a href="/wiki/Rail_transport" id="w">rail</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bus" id="w">bus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Boating" id="w">boating</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft" id="w">air</a> service for regional and provincial transportation needs. A <a href="/wiki/BC_Rail" id="w">BC Rail</a> line runs northeast from Chetwynd to Fort St. John and branches off eastwards to Taylor. The rail line’s terminus is in the industrial sector in the southeast corner on the town. The train, which does not offer passenger service, must turn around in the industrial area in order to travel back to the trunk line. <a href="/wiki/Greyhound_Bus_Lines" id="w">Greyhound Bus Lines</a> maintains a bus stop in Taylor along its Alaska Highway route from Dawson Creek (58 km, 36 miles south of Taylor) to Fort St. John (15 km, 9 miles north of Taylor). Because the Peace River is controlled by two dams upstream, it is navigable for recreational boats. However, due to the <a href="/wiki/Coulee" id="w">coulee</a> between industry and the river, the shipping industries in the town did not develop. The closest commercial <a href="/wiki/Airport" id="w">airport</a> is <a href="/wiki/Fort_St._John_Airport" id="w">Fort St. John Airport</a>, 19 km north of Taylor, with two paved runways.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>

The town uses the Peace River which flows eastward as a source of drinking water and as outlet for industrial waste. The drinking water supply comes from an intake pipe southwest of town. The water is mechanically and chemically filtered then pumped to a reservoir on a ridge north of town. A gravity pump moves the water to the town from the reservoir using 18 km of watermains.<sup id="_ref-redbook_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-redbook" title="">[16]</a></sup> Sewage is collected by 13 km of sanitary sewers and processed by a two-cell lagoon system before being absorbed into the ground.<sup id="_ref-redbook_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-redbook" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>Despite its small population base and its proximity to a much larger urban center Taylor has an ice arena, a curling rink, indoor swimming pool, irrigated baseball diamonds, a dirt race track, and a golf course. The District Ice Center opened in 1993 and consists of an ice hockey rink and leisure skating rink, both of which are used for roller hockey and trade shows and conventions in the summer. The four sheet curling rink is used as a swimming pool in the summer.
