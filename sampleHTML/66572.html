<a id="Description" name="Description"></a><h1>Description</h1>
<p>ENIAC&#39;s physical size was massive compared to modern PC standards.  It contained 17,468 <a href="/wiki/Vacuum_tube" id="w">vacuum tubes</a>, 7,200 crystal <a href="/wiki/Diode" id="w">diodes</a>, 1,500 <a href="/wiki/Relay" id="w">relays</a>, 70,000 <a href="/wiki/Resistor" id="w">resistors</a>, 10,000 <a href="/wiki/Capacitor" id="w">capacitors</a> and around 5 million hand-<a href="/wiki/Solder" id="w">soldered</a> joints.  It weighed 30 <a href="/wiki/Short_ton" id="w">short tons</a> (27 t), was roughly 8.5 feet  by 3 feet by 80 feet (2.6 m by 0.9 m by 26 m), took up 680 square feet (63 m²), and consumed 150 <a href="/wiki/Kilowatt" id="w">kW</a> of power.  Input was possible from an IBM card reader, while an IBM card punch was used for output. These cards could be used to produce printed output offline using an <a href="/wiki/IBM" id="w">IBM</a> accounting machine, probably the <a href="/wiki/IBM_405" id="w">IBM 405</a>.</p>
<p>ENIAC used ten-position <a href="/wiki/Ring_counter" id="w">ring counters</a> to store digits; each digit used 36 tubes, 10 of which were the dual triodes making up the <a href="/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)" id="w">flip-flops</a> of the ring counter. Arithmetic was performed by &#34;counting&#34; pulses with the ring counters and generating carry pulses if the counter &#34;wrapped around&#34;, the idea being to emulate in electronics the operation of the digit wheels of a mechanical <a href="/wiki/Adding_machine" id="w">adding machine</a>. ENIAC had twenty ten-digit signed <a href="/wiki/Accumulator_(computing)" id="w">accumulators</a> that used <a href="/wiki/Ten%26%2339%3Bs_complement" id="w">ten&#39;s complement</a> representation and could perform 5,000 simple addition or subtraction operations between any of them and a source (e.g., another accumulator, constant transmitter) every second (Note: It was possible to connect several accumulators to run simultaneously, so the peak speed of operation was potentially much higher due to parallel operation). It was possible to wire the carry of one accumulator into another to perform <a href="/wiki/Double_precision" id="w">double precision</a> arithmetic but the accumulator carry circuit timing prevented the wiring of three or more for higher precision. The ENIAC used four of the accumulators controlled by a special <i>Multiplier</i> unit and could perform 385 multiplication operations per second. The ENIAC used five of the accumulators controlled by a special <i>Divider/Square-Rooter</i> unit and could perform forty division operations per second or three <a href="/wiki/Square_root" id="w">square root</a> operations per second. The other nine units in ENIAC were the <i>Initiating Unit</i> (started and stopped the machine), the <i>Cycling Unit</i> (synchronized the other units), the <i>Master Programmer</i> (controlled &#34;loop&#34; sequencing), the <i>Reader</i> (controlled an IBM punch card reader), the <i>Printer</i> (controlled an IBM punch card punch), the <i>Constant Transmitter</i>, and three <i>Function Tables</i>.

<p>The references by Rojas and Hashagen or (Wilkes 1956)<sup id="_ref-Wilkes_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wilkes" title="">[3]</a></sup> give more details about the times for operations, which differ somewhat from those above.  The basic machine cycle was 200 <a href="/wiki/Microseconds" id="w">microseconds</a> (20 cycles of the 100 kHz clock in the cycling unit), or 5,000 cycles per second for operations on the 10-digit numbers.  In one of these cycles, ENIAC could write a number to a register, read a number from a register, or add/subtract two numbers.  A multiplication of a 10-digit number by a <i>d</i>-digit number (for <i>d</i> up to 10) took <i>d</i>+4 cycles, so a 10- by 10-digit multiplication took 14 cycles, or 2800 microseconds&#8212;a rate of 357 per second.  If one of the numbers had fewer than 10 digits, the operation was faster.  Division and square roots took 13(<i>d</i>+1) cycles, where <i>d</i> is the number of digits in the result (quotient or square root).  So a division or square root took up to 143 cycles, or 28,600 microseconds&#8212;a rate of 35 per second.  (Wilkes 1956:20<sup id="_ref-Wilkes_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wilkes" title="">[3]</a></sup> states that a division with a 10 digit quotient required 6 milliseconds.) If the result had fewer than ten digits, it was obtained faster.</p>

Some electronics experts predicted that tube failures would occur so frequently that the machine would never be useful.  This prediction turned out to be partially correct: several tubes burned out almost every day, leaving it nonfunctional about half the time. Special high-reliability tubes were not available until 1948. Most of these failures, however, occurred during the warm-up and cool-down periods, when the tube heaters and cathodes were under the most thermal stress. By the simple (if expensive) expedient of never turning the machine off, the engineers reduced ENIAC&#39;s tube failures to the more acceptable rate of one tube every two days. According to a 1989 interview with Eckert the continuously failing tubes story was therefore mostly a myth: &#34;We had a tube fail about every two days and we could locate the problem within 15 minutes.&#34; </p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1954" id="w">1954</a>, the longest continuous period of operation without a failure was 116 hours (close to five days).

<p>The six women who did most of the programming of ENIAC by manipulating its switches and cables were inducted in 1997 into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame <a class="externallink" href="http://www.witi.com/center/witimuseum/halloffame/1997/eniac.php" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.witi.com/center/witimuseum/halloffame/1997/eniac.php">http://www.witi.com/center/witimuseum/halloffame/1997/eniac.php</a>.

<p>Eckert and Mauchly took the experience they gained and founded the <a href="/wiki/Eckert-Mauchly_Computer_Corporation" id="w">Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation</a>, producing their first computer, <a href="/wiki/BINAC" id="w">BINAC</a>, in <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a> before being acquired by <a href="/wiki/Remington_Rand" id="w">Remington Rand</a> in <a href="/wiki/1950" id="w">1950</a> and renamed as their <a href="/wiki/UNIVAC" id="w">UNIVAC</a> division.</p>
<p>ENIAC was a one-of-a-kind design and was never repeated.  The freeze on design in 1943 meant that the computer had a number of shortcomings which were not included in the design, notably the inability to store a program.  <a href="/wiki/John_von_Neumann" id="w">John von Neumann</a>, who was consulting for the Moore School on the <a href="/wiki/EDVAC" id="w">EDVAC</a> (the ENIAC&#39;s successor computer for the BRL) and sat in on the Moore School meetings at which the stored program concept was elaborated, wrote up an incomplete set of notes (<i><a href="/wiki/First_Draft_of_a_Report_on_the_EDVAC" id="w">First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC</a></i>) intended to be used as an internal memorandum describing, elaborating, and couching in formal logical language the ideas developed in the meetings.  Herman Goldstine distributed copies of the <i>First Draft</i> to a number of government and educational institutions, spurring widespread interest in the construction of a new generation of electronic computing machines, including <a href="/wiki/EDSAC" id="w">EDSAC</a> and <a href="/wiki/SEAC_(computer)" id="w">SEAC</a>.</p>
<p>A number of improvements were also made to ENIAC from <a href="/wiki/1948" id="w">1948</a>, including a primitive read-only stored programming mechanism <a class="externallink" href="http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/comphist/48eniac-coding/" rel="nofollow" title="http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/comphist/48eniac-coding/">http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/comphist/48eniac-coding/</a> using the Function Tables as program <a href="/wiki/Read-only_memory" id="w">ROM</a>, an idea included in the ENIAC patent and proposed independently by Dr. Richard Clippinger of the BRL.  Dick Clippinger consulted with John von Neumann on what instruction set to implement.  Clippinger had thought of a 3-address architecture while von Neumann proposed a 1-address architecture because it was simpler to implement.  Three digits of one accumulator (6) were used as the program counter, another accumulator (15) was used as the main accumulator, a third accumulator (8) was used as the address pointer for reading data from the function tables, and most of the other accumulators (1-5, 7, 9-14, 17-19) were used for data memory.  The programming of the stored program for ENIAC was done by Betty Jennings, Dick Clippinger and Adele Goldstine.  It was first demonstrated as a stored-program computer on <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1948" id="w">1948</a>, running a program by <a href="/wiki/Adele_Goldstine" id="w">Adele Goldstine</a> for John von Neumann.  This modification reduced the speed of ENIAC by a factor of six and eliminated the ability of parallel computation, but as it also reduced the reprogramming time to hours instead of days, it was considered well worth the loss of performance.  Also analysis had shown that due to differences between the electronic speed of computation and the electromechanical speed of input/output, almost any practical real world problem was completely <a href="/wiki/I/O_bound" id="w">I/O bound</a> even without making use of the original machine&#39;s parallelism and most would still be I/O bound even after the speed reduction from this modification.  Early in <a href="/wiki/1952" id="w">1952</a>, a high speed shifter was added, which improved the speed for shifting by a factor of five. In July <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a>, a 100-word expansion <a href="/wiki/Core_memory" id="w">core memory</a> was added to the system, using <a href="/wiki/Binary_coded_decimal" id="w">binary coded decimal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Excess-3" id="w">excess-3</a> number representation. To support this expansion memory, the ENIAC was equipped with a new Function Table selector, a memory address selector, pulse-shaping circuits, and three new orders were added to the programming mechanism.</p>

<li>The American <a href="/wiki/Atanasoff%E2%80%93Berry_Computer" id="w">Atanasoff–Berry Computer</a> (ABC) (shown working in December 1939) was the first electronic digital computer. It implemented binary computation with <a href="/wiki/Vacuum_tubes" id="w">vacuum tubes</a> but was not general purpose, being limited to solving systems of linear equations.  It also did not exploit electronic computing speeds, being limited by a rotating <a href="/wiki/Capacitor" id="w">capacitor</a> drum memory and an input-output system that was intended to write intermediate results to paper cards.</li>
<li>The German <a href="/wiki/Z3" id="w">Z3</a> (shown working in May 1941) was designed by <a href="/wiki/Konrad_Zuse" id="w">Konrad Zuse</a>.  It was the first general-purpose digital computer, but it was electromechanical, rather than electronic, as it used <a href="/wiki/Relay" id="w">relays</a> for all functions.  Like the ABC, it computed logically using binary math.  Unlike the ABC, it was <a href="/wiki/Turing-complete" id="w">Turing-complete</a> and fully programmable by punched tape.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/UK" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Colossus_computer" id="w">Colossus computer</a> (used for <a href="/wiki/Cryptanalysis" id="w">cryptanalysis</a> starting in 1943) was designed by <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Flowers" id="w">Tommy Flowers</a>.  Colossus was digital, all-electronic, and could be reprogrammed by rewiring, but was not fully general purpose as it was not Turing-complete.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Howard_Aiken" id="w">Howard Aiken</a>&#39;s 1944 <a href="/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I" id="w">Harvard Mark I</a> was programmed by punched tape and used relays.</li></ul> 
<p>{{Early computer characteristics}}</p>
<p>The ABC, ENIAC and Colossus all used <a href="/wiki/Vacuum_tube" id="w">thermionic valves (vacuum tubes)</a>. ENIAC&#39;s registers performed decimal arithmetic, rather than binary arithmetic like the Z3 or the Atanasoff-Berry Computer.</p>
<p>Until 1948, ENIAC required rewiring to reprogram, like the Colossus. The idea of the stored-program computer with combined memory for program and data was conceived during the development of the ENIAC, but it was not implemented at that time because World War II priorities required the machine to be completed quickly, and it was realized that 20 storage locations for memory and programs would be much too small.</p>

The Colossus machines were part of the UK&#39;s war effort, and were destroyed in 1945 to maintain secrecy.
