<p><b>Acrobatic Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll</b> refers to a very sporty, competitive form of <a href="/wiki/Dance" id="w">dance</a> that originated from the <a href="/wiki/Lindy_hop" id="w">lindy hop</a>. Unlike the lindy hop, however, it is a <a href="/wiki/Choreographed" id="w">choreographed</a> dance designed for performance. It is danced by both couples (usually of mixed gender) and formations, either all-female or 4-8 couples together.

<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> History</h2>

<p>Parallel with the musical <a href="/wiki/Genre" id="w">genre</a> <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" id="w">rock and roll</a>, suitable <a href="/wiki/Dance" id="w">dances</a> were developed. From <a href="/wiki/Swing_(dance)" id="w">swing</a>, which came into being around <a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/USA" id="w">USA</a> the <a href="/wiki/Lindy_Hop" id="w">Lindy Hop</a> very soon emerged, the first <a href="/wiki/Partner_dance" id="w">partner dance</a> ever to feature <a href="/wiki/Acrobatics" id="w">acrobatic</a> elements. The Lindy Hop was again modified around <a href="/wiki/1940" id="w">1940</a> to suit faster music: <a href="/wiki/Boogie_woogie_(dance)" id="w">boogie woogie</a> was born. With rock and roll music coming into fashion around <a href="/wiki/1955" id="w">1955</a>, its adherents converted boogie woogie to the even more athletic rock and roll dance.</p>
<a id="Technique_and_basics" name="Technique_and_basics"></a><h2> Technique and basics </h2>

<p>The most obvious feature of rock and roll are its <b>kicks</b> (into thin air) and its acrobatical elements like <i>lifts</i>, <i>jumps</i>, <i>throws</i> and <i>flips</i>. Today&#39;s rock and roll is a mere <a href="/wiki/Show_dance" id="w">show</a> and <a href="/wiki/Competition_dance" id="w">competition dance</a> and - with the exception of its name - has nearly nothing in common with the former rock and roll movement. It is being danced in pairs or as <a href="/wiki/Formation_dancing" id="w">formation dancing</a>. Over the years rock and roll has experienced several important changes, e. g. the former 6-basic step being converted into the modern tournament&#39;s 9-basic step with its typical <a href="/wiki/Kick_ball_change" id="w">kick ball change</a>. Other characteristics are basic techniques such as the gentleman&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Body_wave_(dance_move)" id="w">body wave</a> movement, that he uses to fling his lady from a sitting position upwards, and the <a href="/wiki/Throwing_basic" id="w">throwing basic</a> movement, where she steps onto his hands and is being catapulted upwards into neck breaking jumps. Because of its demanding technique, high speed and strength consuming acrobatics rock and roll is a straining high-performance sport and therefore is being performed mostly by young dancers.</p>
<p>The name of the basic comes from the number of separate actions. With the 6-basic one counts <i>(1)step (2)step (3)kick (4)settle (5)kick (6)settle</i> or <i>(1)kick (2)settle (3)kick (4)settle (5)kick (6)settle</i>, with the 9-basic it is <i>(1)kick (2)ball (3)change (4)kick (5)settle (6)settle (7)kick (8)settle (9)settle.</i> That means during a kick the technical correctness is achieved when the <a href="/wiki/Ballroom_glossary#Supporting foot" id="w">supporting foot</a> settles on the floor a tiny moment before the kicking foot settles on the floor.</p>
<a id="Dance_categories" name="Dance_categories"></a><h2> Dance categories</h2>

<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Rocknroll-dancing-swan.jpg" title="The &#34;swan&#34;, a popular acrobatic in the Junior class."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocknroll-dancing-swan.jpg" alt="The &#34;swan&#34;, a popular acrobatic in the Junior class." title="The &#34;swan&#34;, a popular acrobatic in the Junior class." class="location-none type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The &#34;swan&#34;, a popular acrobatic in the Junior class.</div></p>
<p>Dance categories
Youth: No acrobatics allowed. Couples are 12 years old or younger.
Juniors: A maximum of three acrobatics allowed under the category&#39;s safety regulations. Couples are between 12 and 17 years of age.
B-Class: Two choreographies per couple. One is a dance program with no acrobatics allowed. The acrobatic program requires six acrobatics. The male may throw the female into the air, but no flips are allowed.
Main Class: Two choreographies as well, with the dance program allowing no acrobatics. The acrobatic program requires six acrobatics as well, though flips are allowed.</p>
<a id="Rhythm_and_music" name="Rhythm_and_music"></a><h2> Rhythm and music </h2>

<p>Rock and roll bases on the 4/4 measure. One basic comprises six beats and therefore one and a half measures. In contrary to the offbeat of rock and roll music, the dance puts stress on the beats one and three of each measure. The music is very fast, at 176 to 208 <a href="/wiki/Bpm" id="w">bpm</a>. Due to non-offbeat stressing and speed traditional rock and roll music has been replaced by modern disco and pop music.</p>
<a id="Clothes" name="Clothes"></a><h2> Clothes </h2>

<p>Nowadays advanced tournament rock and roll dancers don&#39;t wear <a href="/wiki/Petticoats" id="w">petticoats</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jeans" id="w">jeans</a> - as in the beginnings - but rather multi-colored costumes, that are made of elastic artificial <a href="/wiki/Fibre" id="w">fibre</a> and can only be purchased as odd pieces by special <a href="/wiki/Tailor" id="w">tailors</a>. One reason for that is that acrobatic elements have grown more and more dangerous, requiring both freedom of movement and durability to not tear. The most common footwear are light jazz shoes for the dance programs. The acrobatic programs require more support for the female so sneakers made for aerobic dancers are usually chosen.</p>
<a id="Organization" name="Organization"></a><h2> Organization </h2>

<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/World_Rock_%E2%80%99n%E2%80%99_Roll_Confederation" id="w">World Rock’n’Roll Confederation</a></i> is the organization that takes care of national and international rules and guidelines for tournaments. They organize the world cups, european championships, and world championships that occur every year for couples and formations. All international competitors are ranked according to points acquired during competitions.</p>
