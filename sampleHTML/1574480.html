<p><b><i>Californication</i></b> is the seventh studio album by <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Alternative_rock" id="w">alternative rock</a> band <a href="/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" id="w">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>, released on <a href="/wiki/June_8" id="w">June 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a> on <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records" id="w">Warner Bros. Records</a>. Produced by <a href="/wiki/Rick_Rubin" id="w">Rick Rubin</a>, <i>Californication</i> marked the return of <a href="/wiki/John_Frusciante" id="w">John Frusciante</a>, who had previously appeared on <i><a href="/wiki/Mother%26%2339%3Bs_Milk" id="w">Mother&#39;s Milk</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Blood_Sugar_Sex_Magik" id="w">Blood Sugar Sex Magik</a></i>, to replace <a href="/wiki/Dave_Navarro" id="w">Dave Navarro</a> as the band&#39;s guitarist. With his return, Frusciante was credited with changing the band&#39;s style altogether, resulting in a radically different recording than what was produced with Navarro. The album&#39;s subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band, but introduced themes of lust, death, contemplations of suicide, and drugs.</p>
<p><i>Californication</i> produced several hits for the band, including &#34;<a href="/wiki/Around_the_World_(Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_song)" id="w">Around the World</a>&#34;, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Otherside" id="w">Otherside</a>&#34;, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Californication_(song)" id="w">Californication</a>&#34; and the <a href="/wiki/Grammy" id="w">Grammy</a>-award winning &#34;<a href="/wiki/Scar_Tissue" id="w">Scar Tissue</a>&#34;. <i>Californication</i> peaked at #3 on the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Billboard_200" id="w">Billboard 200</a>. It is the Chili Peppers&#39; most commercially successful album to date, selling more than fifteen million copies worldwide;<sup id="_ref-bbc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc" title="">[1]</a></sup> a commercial revitalization in comparison to their previous album, <i>One Hot Minute</i>. The record marked a change in style for the band; <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" id="w">Rolling Stone</a></i>&#39;s Greg Tate noted that &#34;while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited, <i>Californication</i> dares to be spiritual and epiphanal.&#34;<sup id="_ref-rsreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rsreview" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h2>Background</h2>
<p>Guitarist <a href="/wiki/John_Frusciante" id="w">John Frusciante</a> departed from the band mid-tour in 1992, due to his heroin addiction that increasingly worsened, attributed in part to their critically acclaimed album <i><a href="/wiki/Blood_Sugar_Sex_Magik" id="w">Blood Sugar Sex Magik</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> It took over a year before the band found a new guitarist to officially begin recording with. <a href="/wiki/Dave_Navarro" id="w">Dave Navarro</a>, formerly of <a href="/wiki/Jane%26%2339%3Bs_Addiction" id="w">Jane&#39;s Addiction</a>, was invited to join the Chili Peppers after Arik Marshall, who had finished the remaining tour dates for <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>, was fired.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Navarro influenced the band&#39;s ensuing album, <i><a href="/wiki/One_Hot_Minute" id="w">One Hot Minute</a></i>, by incorporating various elements of <a href="/wiki/Heavy_metal_music" id="w">heavy metal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Psychedelic_rock" id="w">psychedelic rock</a>,<sup id="_ref-AMGOHM_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AMGOHM" title="">[5]</a></sup> which was something that the Chili Peppers had not previously been notable for. <i>One Hot Minute</i> was a commercial success, selling roughly five million copies (although a let down compared to <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>).<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Critics, however, dismissed the album, claiming it was weak and unfocused.<sup id="_ref-AMGOHM_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AMGOHM" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Shortly after the release of <i>One Hot Minute</i>, Navarro was fired due to internal differences.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the years following Frusciante&#39;s departure from the Chili Peppers, he had developed a heroin addiction that left him in poverty and near death.<sup id="_ref-redux_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-redux" title="">[9]</a></sup> He was talked into admitting himself to drug rehabilitation in January 1998.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> In April 1998, following Frusciante&#39;s three month completion, Flea visited his former band-mate and openly invited him to re-join the band, an invitation an emotional Frusciante readily accepted. Within the week, and for the first time in six years, the foursome gathered to play, and jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

A substantial amount of the album&#39;s formation took place in the band member&#39;s homes in the summer of 1998. Kiedis and Frusciante often spent days together discussing song creation, guitar riffs and lyrical content. Bass and percussion aspects of the record were constructed through jam sessions and the individual work of Flea and Smith.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Californication&#39;s</i> lyrics were derived from Anthony Kiedis&#39; ideas, outlooks, and perceptions of life and its meaning. &#34;Porcelain&#34; resulted after Kiedis met a young mother at the <a href="/wiki/YMCA" id="w">YMCA</a>, who was attempting to battle her alcohol addiction whilst living with her infant daughter.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Sarcasm had also been lingering in his mind for quite some time and he decided to devote an entire song to the concept. Kiedis found inspiration from former band mate <a href="/wiki/Dave_Navarro" id="w">Dave Navarro</a>, who he considered the &#34;King of Sarcasm&#34;.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Frusciante began playing a poignant guitar riff, which Kiedis immediately saw integrating smoothly into &#34;Scar Tissue&#34;. Running outside with joy, he saw birds flying gracefully overhead which inspired the lyric, &#34;With the birds I&#39;ll share this lonely view&#34;.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>

While most of the album progressed rapidly, &#34;Californication&#34; itself remained a difficult song to complete. Frusciante felt compelled to write an appropriate guitar ensemble to accompany the powerful lyrics, but encountered difficulty.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> The song was barely making progress, and was nearly scrapped had it not been for Kiedis&#39; urgency to include it on the album. Only two days prior to recording did Frusciante set the final riff into place, and taught the rest of the band how to perform it.&#34;Californication&#34; was intended to represent Californian lifestyles, and more specifically, the &#34;fake&#34; nature which is associated with much of <a href="/wiki/Hollywood" id="w">Hollywood</a>.</p>
<p>The record was a change of style for the Chili Peppers, especially when compared to their previous album, <i><a href="/wiki/One_Hot_Minute" id="w">One Hot Minute</a></i>, which combined various elements of <a href="/wiki/Psychedelic_rock" id="w">psychedelic rock</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hard_Rock" id="w">hard rock</a>. Although <i>Californication</i> still contained traces of their once ubiquitous &#34;punk funk&#34; sound (such as &#34;Purple Stain&#34;, &#34;Get On Top&#34;, &#34;I Like Dirt&#34;, &#34;Around the World&#34;, and &#34;Right on Time&#34;), it leaned towards more melodic oriented riffs (for example, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Scar_Tissue" id="w">Scar Tissue</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Otherside" id="w">Otherside</a>&#34;) and focused on songs with implemented structure rather than <a href="/wiki/Jam_session" id="w">jams</a>. Experimental guitar work is consistent in &#34;Savior&#34;, and &#34;This Velvet Glove&#34;, as a <a href="/wiki/Mellotron" id="w">Mellotron</a> and other distortion methods were employed. The album includes multiple references to drugs and <a href="/wiki/Hollywood" id="w">Hollywood</a>.<sup id="_ref-eweekly_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eweekly" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Promotion_and_release" name="Promotion_and_release"></a><h2>Promotion and release</h2>
<p>The Chili Peppers decided to look for other options in who would produce <i>Californication</i>, after working with <a href="/wiki/Rick_Rubin" id="w">Rick Rubin</a> for two consecutive albums.<sup id="_ref-pg420_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pg420" title="">[18]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/David_Bowie" id="w">David Bowie</a> had shown great interest in working with the band and asked to produce the album; however, the Chili Peppers chose to remain with Rubin for <i>Californication</i>.<sup id="_ref-pg420_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pg420" title="">[18]</a></sup> Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought necessary for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Recording took place at Cello Studios in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles%2C_California" id="w">Los Angeles</a>. Following the recording process, the band played &#34;Scar Tissue&#34;, &#34;Otherside&#34;, and &#34;Californication&#34; to their managers, in early 1999, where it was decided that &#34;Scar Tissue&#34; would be the lead single for the album.<sup id="_ref-srtisspg422_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-srtisspg422" title="">[20]</a></sup> To support their reunited line-up, the band played various proms across the country in order to promote <i>Californication</i>.<sup id="_ref-srtisspg422_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-srtisspg422" title="">[20]</a></sup> It sprouted a competition, which called upon high school students to write essays on &#34;...how they could make their schools better, safer, happier, more rocking places, so that they didn&#39;t have to go to school afraid. If you wrote the essay, you got a free ticket to the show&#34;.<sup id="_ref-srtisspg422_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-srtisspg422" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Californication</i> was released on <a href="/wiki/June_8" id="w">June 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a>, debuting at #5 but peaking at #3 on the <a href="/wiki/Billboard_Top_200" id="w">Billboard Top 200</a>. In Europe, the album peaked at #5 on the UK Top 40, #1 on the Finnish, Austrian, Swedish and New Zealand charts, and #2 on the French Top 40.

<p>In March 2006, the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#39; albums were made available to purchase on the <a href="/wiki/ITunes_Music_Store" id="w">iTunes Music Store</a>.<sup id="_ref-itunesrelease_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-itunesrelease" title="">[23]</a></sup> Albums bought there included new previously unreleased tracks (&#34;Fat Dance&#34;, &#34;Over Funk&#34;, and &#34;Quixoticelixer&#34;). The original tracks, unlike the bonus tracks, were not remastered.</p>
<a id="Critical_reception" name="Critical_reception"></a><h2>Critical reception</h2>
<p><i>Californication</i> gained positive critical acceptance in contrast to its less popular predecessor, <i>One Hot Minute</i>, and was a greater success worldwide.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" id="w">Rolling Stone</a></i> credited Kiedis for his drastically improved vocals: &#34;[his] vocal cords have apparently been down to some crossroads and over the rehab, and returned with heretofore unheard-of range, body, pitch, soulfulness, and melodic sensibility.&#34;<sup id="_ref-rsreview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rsreview" title="">[2]</a></sup> Songs such as &#34;Otherside&#34; and &#34;Porcelain&#34; were called &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins" id="w">Pumpkins</a>-esque&#34;, (in reference to their similarity in style to the work of the <a href="/wiki/Smashing_Pumpkins" id="w">Smashing Pumpkins</a>) while the album as a whole was &#34;epiphinal&#34; and that the &#34;RHCP furthermuckers are now moving toward funk&#39;s real Holy Grail: that salty marriage of esoteric mythology and insatiable musicality that salvages souls, binds communities and heals the sick.&#34;<sup id="_ref-rsreview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rsreview" title="">[2]</a></sup> Other critics credited the album&#39;s success to the return of Frusciante. <a href="/wiki/All_Music_Guide" id="w">All Music Guide</a>&#39;s Greg Prato said that the &#34;obvious reason for [the band&#39;s] rebirth is the reappearance of guitarist John Frusciante&#34;, considering him to be the &#34;quintessential RHCP guitarist&#34;.<sup id="_ref-AMGCalif_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AMGCalif" title="">[25]</a></sup> The album as a whole was &#34;a bona fide Chili Peppers classic&#34;.<sup id="_ref-AMGCalif_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AMGCalif" title="">[25]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" id="w">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> also credits Frusciante with transforming the band&#39;s sound into a &#34;more relaxed, less grating, and, in their own way, more introspective album than ever before&#34;.<sup id="_ref-eweekly_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eweekly" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>And while many critics found the band&#39;s new sound refreshing, <i><a href="/wiki/NME" id="w">NME</a></i> scrutinized the Chili Peppers&#39; for rarely utilizing their trademark funk sound, asking: &#34;Can we have our brain-dead, half-dressed funk-hop rock animals back now, please? All this false empathy is starting to make my removed rib tingle.&#34;<sup id="_ref-NMEreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NMEreview" title="">[26]</a></sup> <i>Pitchfork</i>, while considering the album a triumph over <i>One Hot Minute</i>, felt <i>Californication</i> lacked the funk that was ever-present in <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>.<sup id="_ref-pitchfrkreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pitchfrkreview" title="">[27]</a></sup> It went on to scrutinize some lyrics for being overly sexual, but also considered Frusciante to be &#34;the best big- time American rock guitarist going right now&#34;.<sup id="_ref-pitchfrkreview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pitchfrkreview" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>The album received criticism for what Tim Anderson of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" id="w">The Guardian</a></i> called &#34;excessive compression and distortion&#34; in the process of digital remastering,<sup id="_ref-guardianquality_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardianquality" title="">[28]</a></sup> and was the subject of an online petition which garnered over 1,000 signatures.<sup id="_ref-soundpetition_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-soundpetition" title="">[29]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Stylus_Magazine" id="w">Stylus Magazine</a></i> labeled it as one of the victims of the <a href="/wiki/Loudness_war" id="w">loudness war</a> and commented that it suffered from digital clipping so much that &#34;even non-audiophile consumers complained about it&#34;.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Over the years, <i>Californication</i> has maintained its popularity. &#34;Scar Tissue&#34; won a <a href="/wiki/Grammy" id="w">Grammy</a> award for best rock song in 2000.<sup id="_ref-2000grammys_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2000grammys" title="">[31]</a></sup> The album was ranked number 399 on <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" id="w">Rolling Stone</a></i> magazine&#39;s, 2003 list, of <a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone%26%2339%3Bs_500_Greatest_Albums_of_All_Time" id="w">the 500 greatest albums of all time</a> and, in 2006, the Chili Peppers recorded a five-set playlist for <a href="/wiki/AOL_Sessions" id="w">AOL Sessions</a> that included &#34;Californication&#34; and &#34;Scar Tissue&#34;.<sup id="_ref-aolsessions_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aolsessions" title="">[32]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-rsgreatest_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rsgreatest" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-acclaimed_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-acclaimed" title="">[34]</a></sup> The album produced many staple hits for the Chili Peppers; five of the sixteen songs on their <i><a href="/wiki/Greatest_Hits_(Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_album)" id="w">Greatest Hits</a></i> album were taken from <i>Californication</i>.<sup id="_ref-greasthitstracklisting_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-greasthitstracklisting" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

Immediately following the release of <i>Californication</i>, the band embarked on a world tour to support the record, beginning in the United States. To culminate the US leg of their tour, the Chili Peppers were asked to close <a href="/wiki/Woodstock_%26%2339%3B99" id="w">Woodstock &#39;99</a>, which became infamous for the violence it resulted in.<sup id="_ref-scrtisspg423_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scrtisspg423" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> The band was informed minutes before arriving that the crowds and bonfires in the fields had gone out of control.<sup id="_ref-scrtisspg423_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scrtisspg423" title="">[36]</a></sup> When the Chili Peppers performed a tribute to Jimi Hendrix&#39;s song &#34;Fire&#34; to finish their set, the disruption escalated into violence when several women who had been &#39;<a href="/wiki/Crowd_surfing" id="w">crowd surfing</a>&#39; were raped and nearby property was looted and destroyed.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Kiedis felt that &#34;It was clear that this situation had nothing to do with Woodstock anymore. It wasn&#39;t symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and cashing in... We woke up to papers and radio stations vilifying us for playing &#39;Fire&#39;.&#34;<sup id="_ref-p424_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p424" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>To kick off the band&#39;s European tour, the band staged a free show in <a href="/wiki/Moscow" id="w">Moscow</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Red_Square" id="w">Red Square</a>, on <a href="/wiki/August_14" id="w">August 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a>, to a crowd of over 200,000.<sup id="_ref-scrtisspage426_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scrtisspage426" title="">[43]</a></sup> Kiedis recalled the situation: &#34;Red Square was so filled with wall-to-wall Russians that we needed a police escort to get near the stage.&#34;<sup id="_ref-scrtisspage426_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scrtisspage426" title="">[43]</a></sup> Following the European leg, the group did a show in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>, at the <a href="/wiki/Windows_on_the_World" id="w">Windows on the World</a>, for <a href="/wiki/KROQ-FM" id="w">K-Rock</a> radio contest-winners, and then at the <a href="/wiki/Big_Day_Out" id="w">Big Day Out</a> festival in Australia following several Japanese tour dates.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> Flea, however, began to feel the repercussions of touring causing the band to set up concerts that were less strenuous, and consequently less financially rewarding, for them.
