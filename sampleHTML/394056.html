The town is the headquarters of the Kalimpong subdivision, a part of the <a href="/wiki/Darjeeling_District" id="w">district of Darjeeling</a>. A major <a href="/wiki/Military_base" id="w">forward base</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Indian_Army" id="w">Indian Army</a> is located on the outskirts of the town.</p>
<p>Kalimpong is well known for its many educational institutions, which attract students from all over <a href="/wiki/North-East_India" id="w">North East India</a>, <a href="/wiki/West_Bengal" id="w">West Bengal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bhutan" id="w">Bhutan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nepal" id="w">Nepal</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh" id="w">Bangladesh</a>. Some of these famous good education institutes are Dr. Graham&#39;s Homes (co-ed, existing for more than 100 years, {{convert}} of land), St. Augustine School (only for boys), St. Joseph Convent (for girls only), Rockvale Academy (co-ed).  In recent times, Kalimpong has become an important tourist destination owing to its <a href="/wiki/Temperate" id="w">temperate climate</a> and proximity to popular tourist locations in the region. Kalimpong is famous for its <a href="/wiki/Flower" id="w">flower</a> market, especially the wide array of <a href="/wiki/Orchidaceae" id="w">orchids</a>.

The precise <a href="/wiki/Etymology" id="w">etymology</a> of the name <i>Kalimpong</i> remains unclear. The most widely accepted origin of the name <i>Kalimpong</i> is &#34;Assembly (or Stockade) of the King&#39;s Ministers&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Tibetan_language" id="w">Tibetan</a>, derived from <i>kalon</i> (&#34;King&#39;s ministers&#34;) and <i>pong</i> (&#34;<a href="/wiki/Stockade" id="w">stockade</a>&#34;).<sup id="_ref-etymosikkim_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-etymosikkim" title="">[1]</a></sup> Another possible origin to the name comes from the translation &#34;ridges where we play&#34; from <a href="/wiki/Lepcha_language" id="w">Lepcha</a>, derived from the region&#39;s traditional tribal gathering for summer sporting events.<sup id="_ref-etymosikkim_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-etymosikkim" title="">[1]</a></sup> People from the hills also call the area <i>Kalibong</i> (&#34;the black spurs&#34;).<sup id="_ref-etymosikkim_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-etymosikkim" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>According to K.P. Tamsang, author of <i>The Untold and Unknown Reality about the Lepchas</i>, the term Kalimpong is deduced from the name <i>Kalenpung</i>, which in Lepcha means &#34;Hillock of Assemblage&#34;;<sup id="_ref-kalidarjhist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kalidarjhist" title="">[2]</a></sup> in time, the name was distorted to <i>Kaleebung</i> and later corrupted to Kalimpong. Another possible derivation points to Kaulim, a fibrous plant found in profusion in the region.<sup id="_ref-etymosikkim_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-etymosikkim" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The above etymologies point to the original pronunciation as ka-ley-bong which later got corrupted to Kalimpong, most probably due to the inability of the British to pronounce the word.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Morgan House, is a classic example of colonial architecture in Kalimpong.</div>
Until the mid-19th century, the area around Kalimpong was ruled intermittently by the <a href="/wiki/Sikkim" id="w">Sikkimese</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bhutan" id="w">Bhutanese</a> kingdoms. Present-day Kalimpong is believed to have once been the forward position of the Bhutanese in the 18th century, overlooking the Teesta Valley. The area was sparsely populated by the indigenous <a href="/wiki/Lepcha_people" id="w">Lepcha</a> community and migrant <a href="/wiki/Bhutia" id="w">Bhutia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Limbu_people" id="w">Limbu</a> tribes. After the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Bhutan_War" id="w">Anglo-Bhutan War</a> in 1864, the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Sinchula" id="w">Treaty of Sinchula</a> (1865) was signed in which Bhutanese held territory east of the <a href="/wiki/Teesta_River" id="w">Teesta River</a> was ceded to the <a href="/wiki/British_East_India_Company" id="w">British East India Company</a>. At that time, Kalimpong was a hamlet, with only two or three families known to reside there.<sup id="_ref-tribunekalim_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tribunekalim" title="">[3]</a></sup> The first recorded mention of the town was a fleeting reference made that year by <a href="/wiki/Ashley_Eden" id="w">Ashley Eden</a>, a government official with the Bengal Civil Service.</p>
<p>After the war, the region was made into a subdivision of the <a href="/wiki/Western_Duars" id="w">Western Duars</a> district, and the following year it was merged with the district of Darjeeling.<sup id="_ref-kalidarjhist_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kalidarjhist" title="">[2]</a></sup> The temperate climate prompted the British to develop the town as an alternative hill station to <a href="/wiki/Darjeeling" id="w">Darjeeling</a>, to escape the scorching summer heat in the <a href="/wiki/Indo-Gangetic_plain" id="w">plains</a>. Kalimpong&#39;s proximity to the <a href="/wiki/Nathula" id="w">Nathula</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jelepla" id="w">Jelepla</a> passes, offshoots of the ancient <a href="/wiki/Silk_Road" id="w">Silk Road</a>, was an added advantage and it soon became an important trading outpost in the trade of <a href="/wiki/Fur" id="w">furs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wool" id="w">wools</a> and food grains between India and Tibet. The increase in population attracted large numbers of migrants from Nepal, leading to a sudden population increase and economic prosperity.</p>
<p>The arrival of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scottish</a> <a href="/wiki/Missionary" id="w">missionaries</a> saw the construction of schools and welfare centres for the British. Rev. W. Macfarlane in the early 1870s established the first schools in the area.<sup id="_ref-tribunekalim_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tribunekalim" title="">[3]</a></sup> The Scottish University Mission Institution was opened in 1886, followed by the Kalimpong Girls High School. In 1900, Reverend J.A. Graham founded the <a href="/wiki/Dr._Graham%26%2339%3Bs_Homes" id="w">Dr. Graham&#39;s Homes</a> for destitute <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Indian" id="w">Anglo-Indian</a> students. By 1907, most schools in Kalimpong also started offering education to Indian students. By 1911, the population had swelled to 7,880.</p>
<p>Following <a href="/wiki/Indian_independence_movement" id="w">India&#39;s independence</a> in 1947, Kalimpong became part of the state of West Bengal, after Bengal was partitioned between India and <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a>. With <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Republic_of_China" id="w">China&#39;s</a> annexation of Tibet in 1959, many Buddhist monks fled <a href="/wiki/Tibet" id="w">Tibet</a> and established monasteries in Kalimpong. These monks also brought many rare Buddhist scriptures with them. In 1962, the permanent closure of the Jelepla Pass after the <a href="/wiki/Sino-Indian_War" id="w">Sino-Indian War</a> led to a slowdown in Kalimpong&#39;s economy, which relied heavily in trade between Tibet and India. In 1976, the visiting <a href="/wiki/Dalai_Lama" id="w">Dalai Lama</a> consecrated the <a href="/wiki/Zang_Dhok_Palri_Phodang" id="w">Zang Dhok Palri Phodang</a> monastery, which houses many of the scriptures.</p>

Between 1986 and 1988, the demand for a separate state of <a href="/wiki/Gorkhaland" id="w">Gorkhaland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kamtapur" id="w">Kamtapur</a> based on ethnic lines grew strong. Riots between the <a href="/wiki/Gorkha_National_Liberation_Front" id="w">Gorkha National Liberation Front</a> (GNLF), led by <a href="/wiki/C_K_Pradhan" id="w">C K Pradhan</a>, and the West Bengal government reached a standoff after a forty-day strike. The town was virtually under a siege, leading the state government to call in the Indian army to maintain law and order. This led to the formation of the <a href="/wiki/Darjeeling_Gorkha_Hill_Council" id="w">Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council</a>, a body that was given semi-autonomous powers to govern the district. Though Kalimpong is now peaceful, the issue of a separate state still lingers. In July 2004, the generally tranquil town was catapulted into national and international headlines after <a href="/wiki/Maninder_Pal_Singh_Kohli" id="w">Maninder Pal Singh Kohli</a>, a murderer wanted by <a href="/wiki/Scotland_Yard" id="w">Scotland Yard</a>, was traced and found to be residing in Kalimpong.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

Kalimpong has five distinct seasons: spring, summer, autumn, winter and the <a href="/wiki/Monsoon" id="w">monsoons</a>. Summers are mild, with the highs usually never crossing 30&#160;°<a href="/wiki/Celsius" id="w">C</a> (86&#160;°<a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit" id="w">F</a>), and last between May and June. Summers are followed by the monsoon rains which lash the town between June and September. The monsoons are severe, often causing landslides which sequester the town from the rest of India. Winter lasts from December to February, with the maximum temperature being around 15&#160;°C (59&#160;°F). During the monsoon and winter seasons, Kalimpong is often enveloped by <a href="/wiki/Fog" id="w">fog</a>. The annual temperature ranges from a high of 30&#160;°C to a low of −4&#160;°C (25&#160;°F).</p>

<p>The most significant contributor to the Kalimpong economy is tourism. The summer and spring seasons are the most popular with tourists, keeping many of Kalimpong&#39;s residents employed directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>Farming on <a href="/wiki/Terrace_(agriculture)" id="w">terraced slopes</a> is a major source of livelihood for its rural populace and it supplies the town with fruits and vegetables. Education used to be the primary driver of the economy of the town but in recent years its contributions to the economy have stagnated.</p>
<p>Many establishments cater to the Indian army base near the town, providing it with essential supplies. Small contributions to the economy come by the way of the sale of traditional arts and crafts of <a href="/wiki/Sikkim" id="w">Sikkim</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tibet" id="w">Tibet</a>. Government efforts related to <a href="/wiki/Sericulture" id="w">sericulture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Seismology" id="w">seismology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fisheries" id="w">fisheries</a> etc. provide a steady source of employment to many of its residents.

<p>The economic mainstay of Kalimpong is its many schools. These schools besides imparting education to the locals also cater to a significant number of students from the plains, the neighbouring state of Sikkim and also foreign countries such as Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Thailand. Besides providing livelihood to those directly involved with education, such as teachers, paying guest-keepers and other school staff, they also provide a good source of income to book sellers, hawkers, canteen wallahs, restaurant owners, garment sellers and drivers. In fact during the winters when schools shut for vacations, the economy of the town goes into a low scale hibernation mode.</p>

Most people live fairly close to the market and so they walk between their homes and the market.
