<b>Hurricane Isis</b> was the deadliest <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">tropical cyclone</a> and only <a href="/wiki/Pacific_hurricane" id="w">hurricane</a> to make landfall during the <a href="/wiki/1998_Pacific_hurricane_season" id="w">1998 Pacific hurricane season</a>. The ninth tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the season, Isis developed on <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a> out of the interaction between a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> and a large low-level circulation to the southwest of <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a>. It moved northward, striking the extreme southeastern portion of the <a href="/wiki/Baja_California_Peninsula" id="w">Baja California Peninsula</a> before attaining hurricane status in the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_California" id="w">Gulf of California</a>. Isis made landfall at <a href="/wiki/Topolobampo" id="w">Topolobampo</a> in the state of <a href="/wiki/Sinaloa" id="w">Sinaloa</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_3" id="w">September 3</a> and quickly lost its low-level circulation. The remnants persisted for several days before dissipating in the <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">U.S. state</a> of <a href="/wiki/Idaho" id="w">Idaho</a>.</p>
<p>In Mexico, Isis destroyed over 700&#160;houses and killed 14&#160;people, primarily due to its heavy rainfall which peaked at over 20&#160;inches (500&#160;mm) in southern <a href="/wiki/Baja_California_Sur" id="w">Baja California Sur</a>. The rainfall caused widespread damage to roads and railways, stranding thousands of people. Moisture from the remnants of Isis extended into the southwestern <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, resulting in light rainfall, dozens of traffic accidents, and power outages to thousands of residents in <a href="/wiki/San_Diego_County%2C_California" id="w">San Diego County</a>.</p>

A <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> moved off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_14" id="w">August 14</a>. It traveled westward, and on <a href="/wiki/August_19" id="w">August 19</a> developed into the tropical depression which eventually became <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Bonnie_(1998)" id="w">Hurricane Bonnie</a>.<sup id="_ref-bonnietcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bonnietcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> The wave axis continued westward across the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> and <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a>, and crossed <a href="/wiki/Central_America" id="w">Central America</a> into the eastern <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_25" id="w">August 25</a>. The wave decreased its forward speed while approaching a large low-level circulation over southern <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a>. A broad area of disturbed weather formed in association with the wave and the low-level circulation, and after persisting for several days developed a smaller low-level circulation on <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a> about 575&#160;miles (925&#160;km) south-southeast of <a href="/wiki/Cabo_San_Lucas" id="w">Cabo San Lucas</a>. On <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a>, the two primary areas of convection were well-removed from the center, and by early on <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a>, even though deep convection was still not well-organized, the low-cloud circulation was sufficiently well-defined that the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> designated it as Tropical Depression Ten-E while centered slightly less than 350&#160;miles (565&#160;km) south of Cabo San Lucas.<sup id="_ref-tcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> Operationally, the system was not classified until 21&#160;hours later.<sup id="_ref-disc1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The depression initially tracked slowly north-northwestward and gradually strengthened. Late on <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a> it intensified into Tropical Storm Isis while located about 200&#160;miles (320&#160;km) south of Cabo San Lucas.<sup id="_ref-tcr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> Upon becoming a tropical storm, the deep convection was not organized, with one forecaster describing Isis as a large <a href="/wiki/Monsoon" id="w">monsoon</a>-like system.<sup id="_ref-disc1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc1" title="">[3]</a></sup> A mid-level <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">trough</a> extending southward from the <a href="/wiki/Arizona" id="w">Arizona</a>/<a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a> border resulted in the storm to accelerate northward. The storm quickly strengthened; six hours after Isis became a tropical storm it reached winds of 70&#160;mph (115&#160;km/h).<sup id="_ref-tcr_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> Very deep, symmetrical convection developed over the poorly-defined center of circulation while <a href="/wiki/Rainband" id="w">banding features</a> began to form, though ill-defined <a href="/wiki/Outflow_(meteorology)" id="w">outflow</a> and land interaction with the <a href="/wiki/Baja_California_Peninsula" id="w">Baja California Peninsula</a> initially prevented further strengthening.<sup id="_ref-disc3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc3" title="">[4]</a></sup> At 1200 <a href="/wiki/UTC" id="w">UTC</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a>, Isis made <a href="/wiki/Landfall_(meteorology)" id="w">landfall</a> on extreme southeastern <a href="/wiki/Baja_California_Sur" id="w">Baja California Sur</a> as a strong tropical storm, and subsequently turned to the north-northeast.<sup id="_ref-tcr_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>After entering the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_California" id="w">Gulf of California</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)" id="w">eye</a> began to become apparent on visible satellite imagery, and it is estimated Isis attained hurricane status late on September 2. It maintained its intensity as it continued northward, and struck <a href="/wiki/Topolobampo" id="w">Topolobampo</a> in the state of <a href="/wiki/Sinaloa" id="w">Sinaloa</a> early on <a href="/wiki/September_3" id="w">September 3</a> as a minimal hurricane. Isis weakened to a tropical storm a few hours after landfall, and subsequent to turning to the north-northwest the low-level circulation dissipated over <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Madre_Occidental" id="w">Sierra Madre Occidental</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> The remnants entered southern <a href="/wiki/Arizona" id="w">Arizona</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_4" id="w">September 4</a> and tracked around an upper-level low. After entering <a href="/wiki/Nevada" id="w">Nevada</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_5" id="w">September 5</a>, the remnants of Isis passed into <a href="/wiki/Oregon" id="w">Oregon</a> before dissipating in <a href="/wiki/Idaho" id="w">Idaho</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_8" id="w">September 8</a>.<sup id="_ref-rain_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rain" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Preparations" name="Preparations"></a><h2>Preparations</h2>
<p>Coinciding with the issuance of the first advisory on Isis, the government of <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a> issued a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" id="w">tropical storm warning</a> from <a href="/wiki/Dolores%2C_Baja_California_Sur" id="w">Dolores</a> to <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Cortez%2C_Baja_California_Sur" id="w">Puerto Cortex</a> along the <a href="/wiki/Baja_California_Peninsula" id="w">Baja California Peninsula</a>.

Isis first affected <a href="/wiki/Baja_California_Sur" id="w">Baja California Sur</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a> as a tropical storm. Shortly after making landfall, a weather reporting station at <a href="/wiki/San_Jos%C3%A9_del_Cabo" id="w">San José del Cabo</a> recorded sustained winds of 26&#160;mph (42&#160;km/h), with gusts reaching up to 46&#160;mph (74&#160;km/h).

<a id="United_States" name="United_States"></a><h3>United States</h3>
<p>Thunderstorms from the remnants of Isis dropped more than 2&#160;inches (50&#160;mm) of rainfall across southern <a href="/wiki/Arizona" id="w">Arizona</a>, resulting in some flash flood warnings and flooding on roadways.<sup id="_ref-ap905_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ap905" title="">[13]</a></sup> The heaviest rainfall fell across the <a href="/wiki/Santa_Catalina_Mountains" id="w">Santa Catalina</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rincon_Mountains" id="w">Rincon Mountains</a> near <a href="/wiki/Tucson%2C_Arizona" id="w">Tucson</a>, which saw precipitation amounts of up to 3&#160;inches (75&#160;mm).

Low-level moisture dissipated as it continued inland, due to dry air, though upper-level moisture produced light rain across the <a href="/wiki/Northwestern_United_States" id="w">Northwestern United States</a>; <a href="/wiki/Pocatello%2C_Idaho" id="w">Pocatello, Idaho</a> recorded 0.59&#160;inches (15&#160;mm), while <a href="/wiki/Missoula%2C_Montana" id="w">Missoula, Montana</a> recorded 0.39&#160;inches (10&#160;mm).<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Aftermath" name="Aftermath"></a><h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>Aid programs began immediately after Isis moved ashore and dissipated to provided support to the affected population. The Comisión Nacional del Agua distributed 1.6&#160;million gallons (6&#160;million <a href="/wiki/Liter" id="w">liters</a>) of water and provided repair equipment to the 173&#160;localites whose water systems were damaged. More than 650&#160;health workers worked to combat the spread of diseases, including monitoring sanitary conditions of water and foods, and sprayed nearly 9,900&#160;acres (40&#160;km²) of land to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. The force also disinfected more than 6,600&#160;latrines and removed more than 850 tons of sewage to prevent the spread of epidemic. No medical-related deaths occurred as a result of this attention.<sup id="_ref-gob_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gob" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>By 24&#160;hours after the passage of the hurricane, workers had restored power to 70% of the affected residents in <a href="/wiki/Sinaloa" id="w">Sinaloa</a>, and by six days after the storm, electrical service was completely restored. The damage to the federal highway between <a href="/wiki/Culiac%C3%A1n" id="w">Culiacán</a> and <a href="/wiki/Los_Mochis" id="w">Los Mochis</a> along the coastal region of Sinaloa was restored about 48&#160;hours after the passage of the hurricane. The rehabilitation of the agricultural infrastructure began immediately, and most of the drainage networks were repaired by about two weeks after the hurricane. About half of the damaged railways were repaired by about a month after the storm. The total cost for reconstruction and aid amounted to about $18.5&#160;million (1998&#160;<a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">USD</a>, 175&#160;million 1998&#160;<a href="/wiki/MXN" id="w">MXN</a>, $23.3&#160;million 2007&#160;USD), about 94% from federal funds and the rest from state funding.
