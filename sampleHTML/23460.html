<p>The <b>history of Puerto Rico</b> began with the settlement of the <a href="/wiki/Archipelago" id="w">archipelago</a> of <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico" id="w">Puerto Rico</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Ortoiroid_people" id="w">Ortoiroid people</a> between 3000 and 2000 BC. Other tribes, such as the <a href="/wiki/Saladoid" id="w">Saladoid</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arawak" id="w">Arawak</a> Indians, populated the island between 430 BC and 1000 AD. At the time of <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Columbus" id="w">Christopher Columbus</a>&#39;s arrival in the <a href="/wiki/New_World" id="w">New World</a> in 1492, the dominant indigenous culture was that of the <a href="/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno" id="w">Taínos</a>. The Taíno culture died out during the latter half of the 16th century because of exploitation by <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spanish</a> settlers, the war they waged on the Taíno, and diseases introduced by the invaders.</p>
<p>Located in the northeastern <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a>, Puerto Rico formed a key part of the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Empire" id="w">Spanish Empire</a> from the early years of the exploration, conquest and colonization of the <a href="/wiki/New_World" id="w">New World</a>. The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European powers for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The smallest of the <a href="/wiki/Greater_Antilles" id="w">Greater Antilles</a>, Puerto Rico was a stepping-stone in the passage from Europe to <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a>, <a href="/wiki/Central_America" id="w">Central America</a>, and the northern territories of South America. Throughout most of the 19th century until the conclusion of the <a href="/wiki/Spanish-American_War" id="w">Spanish–American War</a>, Puerto Rico and Cuba were the last two Spanish colonies in the New World; they served as Spain&#39;s final outposts in a strategy to regain control of the American continents. </p>
<p>In 1898, during the Spanish–American war, Puerto Rico was invaded and subsequently became a possession of the United States. The first half of the 20th century was marked by the struggle to obtain greater <a href="/wiki/Democratic" id="w">democratic</a> rights from the United States. The <a href="/wiki/Foraker_Act" id="w">Foraker Act</a> of 1900, which established a civil government, and the <a href="/wiki/Jones-Shafroth_Act" id="w">Jones Act</a> of 1917, which granted Puerto Ricans <a href="/wiki/United_States_citizenship" id="w">U.S. citizenship</a>, paved the way for the drafting of <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Puerto Rico&#39;s Constitution</a> and the establishment of democratic elections in 1952. However, the political status of Puerto Rico, a <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_(U.S._insular_area)" id="w">Commonwealth</a> controlled by the United States, remains an anomaly more than 500 years after the first Europeans settled the island.</p>

The settlement of Puerto Rico began with the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/Ortoiroid_people" id="w">Ortoiroid</a> culture from the <a href="/wiki/Orinoco" id="w">Orinoco region</a> in South America. Some scholars suggest that their settlement dates back 4000 years.<sup id="_ref-Rouse_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rouse" title="">[1]</a></sup> An archeological dig at the island of <a href="/wiki/Vieques%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Vieques</a> in 1990 found the remains of what is believed to be an Ortoiroid man (named Puerto Ferro man) which was dated to around 2000 BC.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The Ortoiroid were displaced by the <a href="/wiki/Saladoid" id="w">Saladoid</a>, a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 BC.<sup id="_ref-Rouse_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rouse" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Between the seventh and eleventh centuries <a href="/wiki/Arawak" id="w">Arawaks</a> are thought to have settled the island. During this time the Taíno culture developed, and by approximately 1000 AD it had become dominant. Taíno culture has been traced to the village of Saladero at the basin of the <a href="/wiki/Orinoco" id="w">Orinoco River</a> in <a href="/wiki/Venezuela" id="w">Venezuela</a>;<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> the Taínos migrated to Puerto Rico by crossing the <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Antilles" id="w">Lesser Antilles</a>. </p>
<p>At the time of Columbus&#39; arrival, an estimated 30 to 60 thousand Taíno Amerindians, led by <i><a href="/wiki/Cacique" id="w">cacique</a></i> (chief) Agüeybaná, inhabited the island. They called it Boriken, &#34;the great land of the valiant and noble Lord&#34;.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The natives lived in small villages led by a cacique and subsisted on hunting, fishing and gathering of indigenous <a href="/wiki/Cassava" id="w">cassava</a> root and fruit.  When the <a href="/wiki/Spaniard" id="w">Spaniards</a> arrived in 1493, conflicts with raiding <a href="/wiki/Carib" id="w">Caribs</a>, who were moving up the <a href="/wiki/Antilles" id="w">Antilles</a> chain, were taking place. The Taíno domination of the island was nearing its end and the Spanish arrival would mark the beginning of their extinction. Their culture, however, remains strongly embedded in that of contemporary Puerto Rico. Musical instruments such as <i><a href="/wiki/Maraca" id="w">maracas</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/G%C3%BCiro" id="w">güiro</a></i>, the <a href="/wiki/Hammock" id="w">hammock</a>, and words such as <a href="/wiki/Mayag%C3%BCez%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Mayagüez</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arecibo%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Arecibo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Iguana" id="w">iguana</a>, and <i>huracán</i> (hurricane) are examples of the legacy left by the Taíno.</p>

The first settlement, <a href="/wiki/Caparra" id="w">Caparra</a>, was founded on <a href="/wiki/August_8" id="w">August 8</a> <a href="/wiki/1508" id="w">1508</a> by <a href="/wiki/Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n" id="w">Juan Ponce de León</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant" id="w">lieutenant</a> under Columbus, who later became the first <a href="/wiki/Governor" id="w">governor</a> of the island.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> The following year, the settlement was abandoned in favor of a nearby islet on the coast, named Puerto Rico (Rich Port), which had a suitable harbor. In 1511, a second settlement, <a href="/wiki/San_Germ%C3%A1n%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">San Germán</a> was established in the southwestern part of the island. During the 1520s, the island took the name of Puerto Rico while the port became <a href="/wiki/San_Juan%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">San Juan</a>. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Colonization" id="w">Colonization</a> took the form of <i><a href="/wiki/Encomienda" id="w">encomienda</a></i> settlements, where settlers enslaved Taínos, providing them with military protection in return for labor.<sup id="_ref-Rouse_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rouse" title="">[1]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/December_27" id="w">December 27</a> <a href="/wiki/1512" id="w">1512</a>, under pressure from the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic Church</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon" id="w">Ferdinand II of Aragon</a> issued the <a href="/wiki/Leyes_de_Burgos" id="w">Burgos&#39; Laws</a>, which modified the <i>encomiendas</i> into a system called <i><a href="/wiki/Repartimiento" id="w">repartimientos</a></i>, aimed at ending the exploitation. The laws prohibited the use of any form of punishment toward the indigenous people, regulated their work hours, pay, hygiene, and care, and ordered them to be <a href="/wiki/Catechism" id="w">catechized</a>. In 1511, the Taínos revolted against the Spanish; cacique <a href="/wiki/Urayo%C3%A1n" id="w">Urayoán</a>, as planned by <a href="/wiki/Ag%C3%BCeyban%C3%A1" id="w">Agüeybaná II</a>, ordered his warriors to drown the Spanish soldier <a href="/wiki/Diego_Salcedo_(soldier)" id="w">Diego Salcedo</a> to determine whether the Spaniards were immortal.

<p>The Roman Catholic Church, realizing the opportunity to expand its influence, also participated in colonizing the island. On <a href="/wiki/August_8" id="w">August 8</a> <a href="/wiki/1511" id="w">1511</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Julius_II" id="w">Pope Julius II</a> established three <a href="/wiki/Diocese" id="w">dioceses</a> in the New World, one in Puerto Rico and two on the island of <a href="/wiki/Hispaniola" id="w">Hispaniola</a> under the <a href="/wiki/Archbishop" id="w">archbishop</a> of <a href="/wiki/Seville" id="w">Seville</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The Canon of <a href="/wiki/Salamanca" id="w">Salamanca</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alonso_Manso" id="w">Alonso Manso</a>, was appointed bishop of the Puerto Rican diocese. On <a href="/wiki/September_26" id="w">September 26</a> <a href="/wiki/1512" id="w">1512</a>, before his arrival on the island, the first school of advanced studies was established by the bishop.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Taking possession in 1513, he became the first bishop to arrive in the Americas. Puerto Rico would also become the first ecclesiastical headquarters in the New World during the reign of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Leo_X" id="w">Pope Leo X</a> and the general headquarters of the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition" id="w">Spanish Inquisition</a> in the New World.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>As part of the colonization process, <a href="/wiki/African_slave_trade" id="w">African slaves</a> were brought to the island in 1513.

The Caribs, a raiding tribe of the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" id="w">Caribbean</a>, attacked Spanish settlements along the banks of the Daguao and Macao rivers in 1514 and again in 1521 but each time they were easily repelled by the superior Spanish firepower. However, these would not be the last attempts at control of Puerto Rico. The European powers quickly realized the potential of the newly discovered lands and attempted to gain control of them.</p>

Sparked by the possibility of immense wealth, many European powers made attempts to wrest control of the Americas from Spain in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Success in invasion varied, and ultimately all Spanish opponents failed to maintain permanent control of the island. In 1528, the <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a>, recognizing the strategic value of Puerto Rico, sacked and burned the southwestern town of San Germán. They also destroyed many of the island&#39;s first settlements, including <a href="/wiki/Gu%C3%A1nica%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Guánica</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aguada%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Sotomayor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ceiba%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Daguao</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lo%C3%ADza%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Loíza</a> before the local militia forced them to retreat. The only settlement that remained was the capital, San Juan. French corsairs would again sack San Germán in 1538 and 1554. </p>
<p>Spain, determined to defend its possession, began the fortification of the inlet of San Juan in the early 16th century. In 1532, construction of the first fortifications began with <i><a href="/wiki/La_Fortaleza" id="w">La Fortaleza</a></i> (the Fortress) near the entrance to San Juan bay.<sup id="_ref-WorldHeritage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WorldHeritage" title="">[12]</a></sup> Seven years later the construction of massive defenses around San Juan began, including Fort San Felipe del Morro astride the entrance to San Juan bay.<sup id="_ref-WorldHeritage_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WorldHeritage" title="">[12]</a></sup> Later, <a href="/wiki/Fort_San_Crist%C3%B3bal" id="w">Fort San Cristóbal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fort_San_Jer%C3%B3nimo" id="w">Fort San Jerónimo</a>—built with a financial subsidy from the Mexican mines—garrisoned troops and defended against land attacks. In 1587, engineers <a href="/wiki/Juan_de_Tejada" id="w">Juan de Tejada</a> and <a href="/wiki/Juan_Bautista_Antonelli" id="w">Juan Bautista Antonelli</a> redesigned Fort San Felipe del Morro; these changes endure.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

Knowing Drake had failed to overcome the city&#39;s defenses by sea, on <a href="/wiki/June_15" id="w">June 15</a> <a href="/wiki/1598" id="w">1598</a>, the <a href="/wiki/British_Navy" id="w">British Navy</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/George_Clifford" id="w">George Clifford</a>, <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Cumberland" id="w">Earl of Cumberland</a>, landed troops from 21 ships to the east in <a href="/wiki/Santurce" id="w">Santurce</a>.  Clifford and his men met Spanish resistance while attempting to cross the San Antonio bridge (from an area known today as <a href="/wiki/Condado" id="w">Condado</a>) into the islet of San Juan. Nonetheless, the British conquered the island and held it for several months. They were forced to abandon the island owing to an outbreak of <a href="/wiki/Dysentery" id="w">dysentery</a> among the troops. The following year Spain sent soldiers, cannons, and a new governor, <a href="/wiki/Alonso_de_Mercado" id="w">Alonso de Mercado</a>, to rebuild the city of San Juan.</p>
<p>The 17th and 18th centuries saw more attacks on the island. On <a href="/wiki/September_25" id="w">September 25</a> <a href="/wiki/1625" id="w">1625</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Dutch</a>, under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/Boudewijn_Hendrick" id="w">Boudewijn Hendrick</a> (Balduino Enrico), attacked San Juan, besieging Fort San Felipe del Morro and La Fortaleza. Residents fled the city but the Spanish, led by Governor <a href="/wiki/Juan_de_Haro" id="w">Juan de Haro</a>, were able to repel the Dutch troops from Fort San Felipe del Morro. In their retreat the Dutch set the city ablaze. The fortification of San Juan continued; in 1634, <a href="/wiki/Philip_IV_of_Spain" id="w">Philip IV of Spain</a> fortified Fort San Cristóbal, along with six fortresses linked by a line of sandstone walls surrounding the city. In 1702, the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_England" id="w">English</a> assaulted the town of Arecibo, located on the north coast, west of San Juan, with no success. In 1797, the French and Spanish declared war on the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain" id="w">United Kingdom</a>. The British attempted again to conquer the island, attacking San Juan with an invasion force of 7,000 troops and an <a href="/wiki/Armada" id="w">armada</a> consisting of 64 warships<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> under the command of General <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Abercromby" id="w">Ralph Abercromby</a>.

<div class="thumbcaption">Royal Decree of Graces, 1815, which allowed foreigners to enter Puerto Rico</div>
The 19th century brought many changes to Puerto Rico, both political and social. In 1809, the Spanish government, in opposition to <a href="/wiki/Napoleon" id="w">Napoleon</a>, was convened in Cádiz in southern Spain. While still swearing allegiance to the king, the <i><a href="/wiki/Cortes_Generales" id="w">Cortes Generales</a></i> invited voting representatives from the colonies. <a href="/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Power_y_Giralt" id="w">Ramón Power y Giralt</a> was nominated as the local delegate to the <i><a href="/wiki/C%C3%A1diz_Cortes" id="w">Cádiz Cortes</a></i>. The <a href="/wiki/Power_Law" id="w">Power Law</a> soon followed, which designated five ports for free commerce—<a href="/wiki/Fajardo%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Fajardo</a>, Mayagüez, <a href="/wiki/Aguadilla%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Aguadilla</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cabo_Rojo%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Cabo Rojo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ponce%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Ponce</a>—and established economic reforms with the goal of developing a more efficient economy.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> In 1812, the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Constitution_of_1812" id="w">Cádiz Constitution</a> was adopted, dividing Spain and its territories into provinces, each with a local corporation or council to promote its prosperity and defend its interests; this granted Puerto Ricans conditional citizenship. </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_10" id="w">August 10</a> <a href="/wiki/1815" id="w">1815</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Decree_of_Graces_of_1815" id="w">Royal Decree of Grace</a> was issued, allowing foreigners to enter Puerto Rico (including French refugees from Hispaniola), and opening the port to trade with nations other than Spain. This was the beginning of agriculture-based economic growth, with sugar, tobacco and coffee being the main products. The Decree also gave free land to anyone who swore their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and their allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church. Thousands of families from all regions of Spain (particularly Asturias, Catalonia, Majorca and Galicia), <a href="/wiki/German_immigration_to_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Corsican_immigration_to_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Corsica</a>, <a href="/wiki/Irish_immigration_to_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Ireland</a>, <a href="/wiki/French_immigration_to_Puerto_Rico" id="w">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portugal</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Canary_Islands" id="w">Canary Islands</a> and other locations, escaping from harsh economic times in Europe and lured by the offer of free land, soon immigrated to Puerto Rico. However, these small gains in autonomy and rights were short lived. After the fall of Napoleon, <a href="/wiki/Absolute_monarchy" id="w">absolute power</a> returned to Spain, which revoked the Cádiz Constitution and reinstated Puerto Rico to its former condition as a <a href="/wiki/Colony" id="w">colony</a>, subject to the unrestricted power of the Spanish <a href="/wiki/Monarch" id="w">monarch</a>. </p>
<p>The integration of immigrants into Puerto Rican culture and other events changed Puerto Rican society. On <a href="/wiki/June_25" id="w">June 25</a> <a href="/wiki/1835" id="w">1835</a>, Queen <a href="/wiki/Maria_Christina_of_Bourbon-Two_Sicilies" id="w">María Cristina</a> abolished the <a href="/wiki/Slave_trade" id="w">slave trade</a> to Spanish colonies. In 1851, Governor <a href="/wiki/Juan_de_la_Pezuela_Cevallos" id="w">Juan de la Pezuela Cevallos</a> founded the Royal Academy of Belles Letters. The academy licensed primary school teachers, formulated school methods, and held literary contests that promoted the intellectual and literary progress of the island.  In 1858, the telegraph was introduced on the island with the assistance of <a href="/wiki/Samuel_F._B._Morse" id="w">Samuel F. B.

The latter half of the 19th century was marked by the Puerto Rican struggle for <a href="/wiki/Autonomous_entity" id="w">autonomy</a>. A census conducted in 1860 revealed a population of 583,308. Of these, 300,406 (51.5%) were white and 282,775 (48.5%) were persons of color, the latter including people of primarily African heritage, <a href="/wiki/Mulatto" id="w">mulattos</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mestizo" id="w">mestizos</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> The majority of the population in Puerto Rico was illiterate (83.7%) and lived in poverty, and the agricultural industry—at the time, the main source of income—was hampered by lack of road infrastructure, adequate tools and equipment, and natural disasters, including hurricanes and droughts.<sup id="_ref-Brás_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brás" title="">[21]</a></sup> The economy also suffered from increasing tariffs and taxes imposed by the Spanish Crown. Furthermore, Spain had begun to exile or jail any person who called for liberal reforms. </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_23" id="w">September 23</a> <a href="/wiki/1868" id="w">1868</a>, hundreds of men and women in the town of <a href="/wiki/Lares%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Lares</a>—stricken by poverty and politically estranged from Spain—revolted against Spanish rule, seeking <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rican_independence" id="w">Puerto Rican independence</a>. The <i><a href="/wiki/Grito_de_Lares" id="w">Grito de Lares</a></i> (&#34;Lares Cry&#34; or &#34;Lares Uprising&#34;) was planned by a group led by Dr. <a href="/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Emeterio_Betances" id="w">Ramón Emeterio Betances</a>, at the time exiled to the <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" id="w">Dominican Republic</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Segundo_Ruiz_Belvis" id="w">Segundo Ruiz Belvis</a>.<sup id="_ref-Brás_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brás" title="">[21]</a></sup> Dr. Betances had founded the <i>Comité Revolucionario de Puerto Rico</i> (<a href="/wiki/Revolutionary_Committee_of_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico</a>) in January 1868.

In March 1887, the <i>Partido Federal Reformista</i> was reformed and named the <i>Partido Autonomista Puertorriqueño</i> (<a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rican_Autonomist_Party" id="w">Puerto Rican Autonomist Party</a>); it tried to create a political and legal identity for Puerto Rico while emulating Spain in all political matters. It was led by Román Baldorioty de Castro, <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Celso_Barbosa" id="w">José Celso Barbosa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rosendo_Matienzo_Cintr%C3%B3n" id="w">Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón</a> and <a href="/wiki/Luis_Mu%C3%B1oz_Rivera" id="w">Luis Muñoz Rivera</a>.</p>
<p>The struggle for autonomy came close to achieving its goal on <a href="/wiki/November_25" id="w">November 25</a> <a href="/wiki/1897" id="w">1897</a>, when the <i>Carta Autonómica</i> (<a href="/wiki/Autonomic_Charter" id="w">Autonomic Charter</a>), which conceded political and administrative autonomy to the island, was approved in Spain. In the past 400-plus years, after centuries of colonial rule, <a href="/wiki/Pr%C3%A1xedes_Mateo_Sagasta" id="w">Práxedes Mateo Sagasta</a>, the Prime Minister of Spain granted the island an independent government on November 25, 1897 in the empire’s legislative body in Cádiz, Spain and trade was opened up with the United States and European colonies. The charter maintained a governor appointed by Spain, who held the power to veto any legislative decision he disagreed with, and a partially elected parliamentary structure.<sup id="_ref-LOC_Chronology_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LOC_Chronology" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> That same year, the <i>Partido Autonomista Ortodoxo</i> (<a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Autonomist_Party" id="w">Orthodox Autonomist Party</a>), led by José Celso Barbosa and <a href="/wiki/Manuel_Fern%C3%A1ndez_Juncos" id="w">Manuel Fernández Juncos</a>, was founded.

They accepted or rejected commercial treaties concluded by Spain. In February of 1898, Governor General Manuel Macías inaugurated the new government of Puerto Rico under the Autonomous Charter which gave town councils complete autonomy in local matters. Subsequently, the governor had no authority to intervene in civil and political matters unless authorized to do so by the Cabinet. General elections were held in March and on July 17, 1898 Puerto Rico&#39;s autonomous government began to function, but not for long. The government can be compared with the present-day Autonomous Community of the <a href="/wiki/Canary_Islands" id="w">Canary Islands</a>.</p>

After the ratification of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, Puerto Rico came under the military control of the United States of America. This brought about significant changes: the name of the island was changed to <i>Porto Rico</i> (it would be changed back to Puerto Rico in 1932) and the currency was changed from the <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rican_peso" id="w">Puerto Rican peso</a> to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">United States dollar</a>.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Freedom of assembly, speech, press, and religion were decreed and an <a href="/wiki/Eight-hour_day" id="w">eight-hour day</a> for government employees was established. A public school system was begun and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service" id="w">U.S. Postal service</a> was extended to the island. The highway system was enlarged, and bridges over the more important rivers were constructed. The government lottery was abolished, <a href="/wiki/Cockfight" id="w">cockfighting</a> was forbidden, and a centralized public health service established.<sup id="_ref-ASPIRA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ASPIRA" title="">[30]</a></sup> Health conditions were poor at the time, with high rates of infant mortality and numerous endemic diseases.  </p>
<p>The beginning of the military government also marked the creation of new political groups. The <i><a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rican_Republican_Party" id="w">Partido Republicano</a></i> (Republican Party) and the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Party_(Puerto_Rico)" id="w">American Federal Party</a> were created, led by José Celso Barbosa and Luis Muñoz Rivera, respectively. Both groups supported annexation by the United States as a solution to the colonial situation. The island&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Criollo" id="w">Creole</a> sugar planters, who had suffered from declining prices, greeted U.S. rule, hoping to gain access to the North American market.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup>   </p>
<p>Disaster struck in August 1899, when two hurricanes ravaged the island: <a href="/wiki/1899_Hurricane_San_Ciriaco" id="w">Hurricane San Ciriaco</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_8" id="w">August 8</a>, and an unnamed hurricane on <a href="/wiki/August_22" id="w">August 22</a>.

The military government in Puerto Rico was short lived; it was disbanded on <a href="/wiki/April_2" id="w">April 2</a> <a href="/wiki/1900" id="w">1900</a> when the U.S. Congress enacted the <a href="/wiki/Foraker_Act" id="w">Foraker Act</a> (also known as the Organic Act of 1900), sponsored by Senator <a href="/wiki/Joseph_B._Foraker" id="w">Joseph B. Foraker</a>.<sup id="_ref-LOC_Foraker_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LOC_Foraker" title="">[33]</a></sup> This act established a civil government and free commerce between the island and the United States. The structure of the insular government included a governor appointed by the president, an executive council (the equivalent of a senate), and a legislature with 35 members, though the executive veto required a two-thirds vote to override. The first appointed civil governor, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Herbert_Allen" id="w">Charles Herbert Allen</a>, was inaugurated on <a href="/wiki/May_1" id="w">May 1</a> <a href="/wiki/1900" id="w">1900</a>.<sup id="_ref-LOC_Foraker_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LOC_Foraker" title="">[33]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/June_5" id="w">June 5</a>, President McKinley appointed an Executive Council which included five Puerto Rican members and six U.S. members.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> The act also established the creation of a judicial system headed by the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Supreme Court of Puerto Rico</a> and allowed Puerto Rico to send a <a href="/wiki/Resident_Commissioner_of_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Resident Commissioner</a> as a representative to Congress.<sup id="_ref-LOC_Foraker_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LOC_Foraker" title="">[33]</a></sup> The Department of Education was subsequently formed, headed by Dr. M. G. Brumbaugh (later governor of <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a>). Teaching was conducted entirely in English with Spanish treated as a special subject. However, both Spanish and English were official languages in the island. On <a href="/wiki/November_6" id="w">November 6</a>, the first elections under the Foraker Act were held and on <a href="/wiki/December_3" id="w">December 3</a>, the first <a href="/wiki/Legislative_Assembly" id="w">Legislative Assembly</a> took office. <a href="/wiki/Federico_Degetau" id="w">Federico Degetau</a> took office in Washington as the first Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico on <a href="/wiki/March_14" id="w">March 14</a> <a href="/wiki/1901" id="w">1901</a>. </p>
<p>The new political status sparked the creation of more political groups on the island. In 1900, the <i>Partido Federal</i> (<a href="/wiki/Federal_Party_(Puerto_Rico)" id="w">Federal Party</a>) and the <i>Partido Obrero Socialista de Puerto Rico</i> (<a href="/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Socialist Labor Party of Puerto Rico</a>) were founded. The former campaigned for Puerto Rico to become one of the states in the United States while the latter followed the ideals of the <a href="/wiki/Socialist_Labor_Party_of_America" id="w">Socialist Labor Party of America</a>. Four years later, in 1904, Luis Muñoz Rivera and <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_de_Diego" id="w">José de Diego</a> restructured the American Federal Party into the <i>Partido Unionista de Puerto Rico</i> (<a href="/wiki/Union_of_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Unionist Party of Puerto Rico</a>) with the intention of fighting against the colonial government established under the Foraker Act. In 1909, <a href="/wiki/Rosendo_Matienzo_Cintr%C3%B3n" id="w">Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón</a>, <a href="/wiki/Manuel_Zeno_Gand%C3%ADa" id="w">Manuel Zeno Gandía</a>, <a href="/wiki/Luis_Llorens_Torres" id="w">Luis Llorens Torres</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eugenio_Ben%C3%ADtez_Casta%C3%B1o" id="w">Eugenio Benítez Castaño</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pedro_Franceschi" id="w">Pedro Franceschi</a> founded the <i>Partido Independentista</i> (<a href="/wiki/Independence_Party_(Puerto_Rico)" id="w">Independence Party</a>). It was the first political party whose agenda was the <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rican_independence" id="w">independence of Puerto Rico</a>.</p>
<p>The status quo was again altered in 1909 when the Foraker Act, due to weaknesses and a small crisis in Puerto Rico&#39;s government, was modified by the <a href="/wiki/Olmsted_Amendment" id="w">Olmsted Amendment</a>. This Amendment placed the supervision of Puerto Rican affairs in the jurisdiction of an executive department to be designated by the president.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> In 1914, the first Puerto Rican officers, <a href="/wiki/Martin_Travieso" id="w">Martin Travieso</a> (Secretary) and <a href="/wiki/Manuel_V._Domenech" id="w">Manuel V. Domenech</a> (Commissioner of Interiors), were assigned to the Executive Cabinet, allowing islanders a majority. A 1915 delegation from Puerto Rico, accompanied by the Governor <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Yager" id="w">Arthur Yager</a>, traveled to Washington, D.C. to ask Congress to grant the island more autonomy. This delegation and speeches made by Resident Commissioner Luis Muñoz Rivera in Congress, coupled with political and economic interests, led to the drafting of the <a href="/wiki/Jones-Shafroth_Act" id="w">Jones-Shafroth Act</a> of 1917 (Jones Act).</p>

On <a href="/wiki/October_11" id="w">October 11</a> <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a>, an <a href="/wiki/1918_Puerto_Rico_Earthquake" id="w">earthquake</a> occurred, with an approximate magnitude of 7.3 on the <a href="/wiki/Richter_scale" id="w">Richter scale</a>, accompanied by a <a href="/wiki/Tsunami" id="w">tsunami</a> reaching 6.1&#160;<a href="/wiki/Metre" id="w">metres</a> (20&#160;feet) in height.<sup id="_ref-Quake1918_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Quake1918" title="">[37]</a></sup> The epicenter was located northwest of Aguadilla in the Mona Canyon (between Puerto Rico and the <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" id="w">Dominican Republic</a>).<sup id="_ref-Quake1918_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Quake1918" title="">[37]</a></sup> This earthquake caused great damage and loss of life at <a href="/wiki/Mayag%C3%BCez%2C_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Mayagüez</a>, and lesser damage along the west coast. Tremors continued for several weeks.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the Jones Act and the establishment of elections, a new political party, the <i>Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico</i> (<a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rican_Nationalist_Party" id="w">Puerto Rican Nationalist Party</a>), was founded on <a href="/wiki/September_17" id="w">September 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1922" id="w">1922</a>. In the 1930s, the Nationalist Party, led by <a href="/wiki/Pedro_Albizu_Campos" id="w">Pedro Albizu Campos</a> withdrew from political participation and increased conflict arose between their adherents and the authorities. They attacked <a href="/wiki/Blanton_Winship" id="w">Blanton Winship</a>, the appointed Governor of Puerto Rico, <a href="/wiki/Elisha_Francis_Riggs" id="w">Elisha Francis Riggs</a> Chief of Police, and <a href="/wiki/Robert_A._Cooper" id="w">Robert A. Cooper</a> Judge of the Federal Tribunal in Puerto Rico. On <a href="/wiki/February_23" id="w">February 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a>, two Nationalists <a href="/wiki/Hiram_Rosado" id="w">Hiram Rosado</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elias_Beauchamp" id="w">Elias Beauchamp</a>, in retaliation for the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Rio_Piedras_Massacre" id="w">Rio Piedras Massacre</a>&#34;, killed Police Chief Riggs in San Juan. They were apprehended and summarily executed at police headquarters. On <a href="/wiki/July_31" id="w">July 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a>, Pedro Albizu Campos, <a href="/wiki/Juan_Antonio_Corretjer" id="w">Juan Antonio Corretjer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Clemente_Soto_V%C3%A9lez" id="w">Clemente Soto Vélez</a> and other Nationalists were sentenced to six to 10 years in federal prison. Later, on <a href="/wiki/March_21" id="w">March 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1937" id="w">1937</a>, police opened fire at a <i>Nacionalista de Puerto Rico</i> (Puerto Rican Nationalist) Party parade, known as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Ponce_Massacre" id="w">Ponce Massacre</a>&#34;; 20 people (including two policemen) were killed and 100 were wounded.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1920s, the economy of Puerto Rico boomed. A drastic increase in the price of sugar, Puerto Rico&#39;s principal export, brought increasing revenues to the island. As a result the island&#39;s infrastructure was steadily upgraded. New schools, roads and bridges were constructed. The increase in private wealth was reflected in the erection of many residences, while the development of commerce and agriculture stimulated the extension of banking and transport facilities. The high infant mortality death rate of the late 19th century declined steadily, thanks in large measure to basic public health programs. However, the economic growth would come to a screeching halt in 1929 when the United States <a href="/wiki/Stock_market_crash" id="w">stock market crashed</a>.</p>
<p>This period of prosperity came to an end with the onset of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">Great Depression</a>. At the time, agriculture was the main contributor to the economy.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Industry and commerce slowed during the 1930s as well.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> The depression was further aggravated when on <a href="/wiki/September_27" id="w">September 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1932" id="w">1932</a>, <a href="/wiki/1932_San_Ciprian_Hurricane" id="w">Hurricane San Ciprián</a> struck the island. Exact figures of the destruction are not known but estimates say that 200–300 people were killed, more than a thousand were injured, and property damage escalated to $30–50 million.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> The agricultural production, the principal economic driver for the island, came to a standstill. However, the decline of the economy would not end there. A new federal <a href="/wiki/Minimum_wage" id="w">minimum wage</a> law of 25 cents an hour took effect in 1938. As a consequence, two-thirds of the island&#39;s textile factories closed because worker productivity was below that level.</p>

<p>In the years after World War II, social, political and economical changes began to take place that have continued to shape the island&#39;s character today. The late 1940s brought the beginning of a <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rican_migration_to_New_York" id="w">major migration</a> to the continental United States, mainly to <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>. The main reasons for this were an undesirable economic situation brought by the Great Depression, as well as heavy recruitment made by the <a href="/wiki/Military_of_the_United_States" id="w">U.S. armed forces</a> and U.S. companies.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> In 2004, approximately 3.8 million people of Puerto Rican background lived in the United States.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> Political changes began in 1946 when President Truman designated the first Puerto Rican, Commissioner Resident <a href="/wiki/Jes%C3%BAs_T._Pi%C3%B1ero" id="w">Jesús T. Piñero</a>, to serve as island governor. One year later the U.S. Congress passed an act allowing Puerto Ricans to vote for their own governor. The first elections under this act were performed on <a href="/wiki/November_2" id="w">November 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1948" id="w">1948</a>. <a href="/wiki/Luis_Mu%C3%B1oz_Mar%C3%ADn" id="w">Luis Muñoz Marín</a>, president of the Puerto Rican Senate, successfully campaigned and became the first democratically elected Governor of the island on <a href="/wiki/January_2" id="w">January 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a>. In the 1950s, an ambitious industrialization project dubbed <a href="/wiki/Operation_Bootstrap" id="w">Operation Bootstrap</a> was launched under governor Muñoz Marín. It was coupled with agrarian reform (land redistribution) that limited the area that could be held by large sugarcane interests. Operation Bootstrap enticed US mainland investors to transfer or create manufacturing plants by granting them local and federal tax concessions, but maintaining the access to US markets free of import duties. Another incentive was the lower wage scales in the densely populated island, which had a rising urban unemployed population. The program accelerated the shift from an agricultural to an industrial society.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> The 1950s saw the development of labor-intensive light industries, such as textiles; later manufacturing gave way to heavy industry, such as petrochemicals and oil refining, in the 1960s and 1970s.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> Muñoz Marín&#39;s development programs brought some prosperity for an emergent middle class. The industrialization was in part fueled by generous local incentives and freedom from federal taxation, while providing access to continental US markets without import duties. As a result, a rural agricultural society was transformed into an industrial working class.  </p>

On <a href="/wiki/July_4" id="w">July 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1950" id="w">1950</a>, President <a href="/wiki/Harry_S._Truman" id="w">Harry S. Truman</a> signed Public Act 600, which allowed Puerto Ricans to draft their own constitution establishing the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The U.S. Congress had granted <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_(U.S._insular_area)" id="w">commonwealth</a> status on Puerto Rico that enhanced Puerto Rico&#39;s political status from <a href="/wiki/Protectorate" id="w">protectorate</a> to commonwealth. This, coupled with Muñoz Marín&#39;s reversal on not pursuing Puerto Rican Independence angered some Puerto Ricans. On late October 1950, a group of Puerto Rican nationalists, led by Pedro Albizu Campos, staged several revolts, the most successful of which is known as the <a href="/wiki/Jayuya_Uprising" id="w">Jayuya Uprising</a>. The revolts included an attack on the governor&#39;s mansion, <i>La Fortaleza</i>, the United States Capitol and at Blair House, where nationalists attempted to assassinate United States President Harry S. Truman. These acts led Muñoz to crack down on Puerto Rican nationalists and advocates of Puerto Rican independence. The actions by both Muñoz and the United States&#39; Government would later be determined as infringing on constitutional rights.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/July_25" id="w">July 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1952" id="w">1952</a>, the Constitution of Puerto Rico was approved by voters in a referendum, and the island organized as the <i>Estado Libre Asociado</i> (Commonwealth of Puerto Rico).<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> That same year marked the first time that the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Flag of Puerto Rico</a> could be publicly displayed.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The <i>Partido Estadistas Unido</i> (United Statehooders Party) was founded by <a href="/wiki/Luis_A._Ferr%C3%A9" id="w">Luis A. Ferré</a> to campaign for statehood in the 1967 <a href="/wiki/Plebiscite" id="w">plebiscite</a>. On <a href="/wiki/July_23" id="w">July 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1967" id="w">1967</a>, the first plebiscite on the political status of Puerto Rico was held. Voters overwhelmingly affirmed continuation of Commonwealth status (Commonwealth&#8211;60.4% Statehood&#8211;39%; Independence&#8211;0.6%).<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> Other plebiscites have taken place to determine the political status of Puerto Rico, one in 1993 and another in 1998. Both times, although by smaller margins, the status quo has been upheld.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> However, the U.S. constitution does not mention this avenue of status, hence legally the island remains a territory of the United States, under congressional supervision. The <i>Partido Estadistas Unido</i> organized the <a href="/wiki/New_Progressive_Party_of_Puerto_Rico" id="w">Partido Nuevo Progresista</a> (New Progressive Party) under Ferré&#39;s leadership. The party campaigned for Puerto Rico to become the <a href="/wiki/51st_state" id="w">51st state</a> of the Union. Luis A. Ferré was elected governor on <a href="/wiki/November_5" id="w">November 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1968" id="w">1968</a>, with 43.6% of the vote, the first time a pro-statehood governor has received a plurality. The New Progressive Party, the Popular Democratic Party and the Independence Party constitute the current established political parties in the island. </p>
<p>Present-day Puerto Rico has become a major <a href="/wiki/Tourism" id="w">tourist</a> destination and a leading <a href="/wiki/Pharmaceutical_company" id="w">pharmaceutical</a> and manufacturing center. Still, Puerto Rico continues to struggle to define its political status. Even though Puerto Rico was granted local autonomy in 1952 it remains a <a href="/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States" id="w">territory of the United States</a>. Its ambiguous status continues to spark political debates which dominate Puerto Rican society. Economically, Puerto Rico has recently seen its credit rating downgraded to <a href="/wiki/Moody%26%2339%3Bs%23Long-Term_Obligation_Ratings#Investment grade" id="w">Baa2</a> by <a href="/wiki/Moody%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">Moody&#39;s Investor Services</a> with the possibility of more downgrades happening in the near future.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> This has led to fiscal measures to reduce government spending, increase revenues and balance the budget, and the implementation of a 5.5% sales tax. Additionally, municipalities have the option of imposing a city sales tax between 1% and 1.5%.</p>
