The story is an amalgamation of the first two games in the series, focusing on the first <a href="/wiki/Tekken" id="w">King of Iron Fist Tournament</a> while giving a prominent role to <a href="/wiki/Jun_Kazama" id="w">Jun Kazama</a>, who was introduced in <i><a href="/wiki/Tekken_2" id="w">Tekken 2</a></i>. The two OVA episodes were edited into one and released on <a href="/wiki/VHS" id="w">VHS</a> and <a href="/wiki/DVD" id="w">DVD</a> in <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a> by <a href="/wiki/ADV_Films" id="w">ADV Films</a> and has occasionally been aired on <a href="/wiki/Cable_television" id="w">cable television</a> in the U.S.</p>
<a id="Plot_outline" name="Plot_outline"></a><h1>Plot outline</h1>

<p>The film starts with a flashback featuring <a href="/wiki/Kazuya_Mishima" id="w">Kazuya Mishima</a>, a child studying martial arts under his father. He meets a young girl named <a href="/wiki/Jun_Kazama" id="w">Jun Kazama</a>, who is crying after seeing a <a href="/wiki/Bobcat" id="w">bobcat</a> kill a defenseless <a href="/wiki/Rabbit" id="w">rabbit</a>. When Kazuya offers to go fight the bobcat, Kazuya&#39;s father, <a href="/wiki/Heihachi_Mishima" id="w">Heihachi Mishima</a>, appears and drags Kazuya away. To make his son prove his strength, Heihachi throws Kazuya into a deep ravine, but not before ripping a locket containing a picture of Kazuya&#39;s mother from his son&#39;s neck and tossing it aside. Jun, who tried and failed to locate Kazuya, finds the locket and keeps it with her into adulthood.</p>
<p>On the day of the tournament, Kazuya and Jun fight their way through the other competitors on the island. Kazuya intends to fight his way to the center and kill his father, while Jun races to stop him. After catching up to him, Jun begins to make another appeal when they&#39;re attacked by monsters released by Lee, but they fight them off. Kazuya then continues on his way and quickly beats Lee in direct combat before squaring off against Heihachi.</p>
<p>The fighting is brutal, but Kazuya, who formed a pact with a devil to survive his fall into the ravine as a child, uses his demonic power to defeat his father. Before he can finish him off, however, Jun steps in one last time, and convinces Kazuya that he&#39;s going about things the wrong way. Kazuya is able to calm his spirit, and he takes mercy on his father. In the meantime, Lee, convinced that the Mishima Zaibatsu should be destroyed if he isn&#39;t allowed to inherit it, activates a self-destruct mechanism on the island. Kazuya, Jun and most of the other competitors are able to escape by ship, while Heihachi himself flees the island by air.</p>
<p>In a brief epilogue, Jun is by herself  sewing something among some trees with some animals when her young son, <a href="/wiki/Jin_Kazama" id="w">Jin Kazama</a>, who bears a strong resemblance to Kazuya, runs up to her,telling that he wants to read the story she read to him yesterday. Then Jun sensed that the winds just changed, then Jin asked what&#39;s wrong then Jun replied that it&#39;s just nothing and every thing&#39;s gonna be just fine and they walk off together.</p>
<p>The other major subplot, which runs concurrently with the rest of the film, features <a href="/wiki/Lei_Wulong" id="w">Lei Wulong</a> working as Jun&#39;s partner, who investigates the weapons lab located below the surface of the island with the help of the combat android <a href="/wiki/Jack_(Tekken)#Jack-2" id="w">Jack-2</a>, who wants to cure a little girl of her illness. A few other fighters from the games, most notably <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Irvin" id="w">Bruce Irvin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Baek_Doo_San" id="w">Baek Doo San</a>, <a href="/wiki/Michelle_Chang" id="w">Michelle Chang</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anna_Williams_(Tekken)" id="w">Anna Williams</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nina_Williams" id="w">Nina Williams</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jack_(Tekken)#Prototype Jack" id="w">Prototype Jack</a>, <a href="/wiki/Roger_(Tekken)" id="w">Roger</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ganryu_(Tekken)" id="w">Ganryu</a> play small parts in the story. Most of the other game characters like <a href="/wiki/King_(Tekken)" id="w">King</a>, <a href="/wiki/Armor_King" id="w">Armor King</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yoshimitsu_(Namco)" id="w">Yoshimitsu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Law_(Tekken)" id="w">Marshall Law</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Paul_Phoenix_(Tekken)" id="w">Paul Phoenix</a> appear in background cameos with no direct influence on the story.</p>

<a id="Notable_differences_from_game_to_film" name="Notable_differences_from_game_to_film"></a><h1>Notable differences from game to film</h1>
The <i>Tekken</i> motion picture takes several liberties with its source material. Along with combining events from the first two games in the series, it also rewrites important events and appearances of some of the characters.

<ul>
<li>Jun and Kazuya met for the very first time as children. There is no evidence of this in the games.</li>
<li>Numerous continuity discrepancies related to the meshing of the Tekken 1 &#38; 2 storylines. Some examples include:
<ul>
<li>After defeating Heihachi in the first <i>Tekken</i>, Kazuya becomes the head of the Mishima Zaibatsu in <i>Tekken 2</i>, but despite the presence of <i>Tekken 2</i> elements, Kazuya never becomes head of the Zaibatsu.</li>
<li>In the film, Michelle seeks revenge against Heihachi for destroying her village. However, in the first game, she seeks revenge for Heihachi&#39;s murder of her father, and Kazuya and Ganryu kidnap her mother in <i>Tekken 2</i>.</li></ul></li>
<li>Anna Williams is given a rather gruesome death (apparently eaten alive by an &#34;Alex&#34; dinosaur), but she remains alive and well in the <a href="/wiki/Tekken_6" id="w">sixth game in the series</a>. However, due to the fact that the anime has twisted storyline that is different from the game, in the anime storyline, it is most likely that she has died permanently.</li>
<li>Jack-2 is stated as the prototype while <a href="/wiki/Jack_(Tekken)#Prototype Jack" id="w">Prototype Jack</a> is shown as the final version.</li>
<li>There are multiple Prototype Jacks and multiple dinosaurs based on <a href="/wiki/Alex_(Tekken)" id="w">Alex</a>.</li>
<li>Due to the art style of the anime, several characters (most notably Kazuya) bear little resemblance to their video game counterparts.</li>
<li>Dr. Abel does not appear in the film, despite being an important character in Jack-2&#39;s storyline.</li>
<li>Bruce is Lee&#39;s bodyguard instead of being Kazuya&#39;s bodyguard.</li></ul>
Aside from its quality as an adaptation, <i>Tekken</i> is generally seen as a <a href="/wiki/Cult_film" id="w">cult film</a> or guilty pleasure to its relatively small group of supporters. Some fans also use the film to help explain how Kazuya and Jun conceived their son Jin, who would go on to become the lead protagonist of the video games in <i><a href="/wiki/Tekken_3" id="w">Tekken 3</a></i>, since the video games have remained rather ambiguous on those details. Because of the number of liberties that the film takes with the storyline, the film cannot be considered completely <a href="/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" id="w">canon</a>, but the possibility that Jun and Kazuya&#39;s storyline as depicted in the film may share parallels with the video games remains open.

<a id="Reaction" name="Reaction"></a><h1>Reaction</h1>
<i>Tekken: The Motion Picture</i> has been variously hailed and panned by fans and critics alike. The root of the movie&#39;s popularity stems from the action and the fighting, which fans consider to be outstandingly realistic. But the designs and English voices for some of the characters have led others to dislike the film, especially for Kazuya&#39;s incredibly deep voice and striking resemblance to <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z" id="w">Dragon Ball Z&#39;s</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Vegeta" id="w">Vegeta</a>.

<a id="Tekken_(2009_film)" name="Tekken_(2009_film)"></a><h1> Tekken (2009 film) </h1>
According to various websites, <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Sky_Studios" id="w">Crystal Sky Studios</a> has announced that a new Tekken film is currently in development with a release date around 2009. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Tekken is being written by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Werb" id="w">Michael Werb</a>, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Colleary" id="w">Michael Colleary</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hans_Rodinoff" id="w">Hans Rodinoff</a>. It has been said that <a href="/wiki/Charles_Stone_III" id="w">Charles Stone III</a> will be one of the directors.

IGN Movies and IMDb posted the summary as:<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>

&#34;In order to put to rest the ghosts of his past, Jin Kazama enters the Tekken tournament, a fierce and dangerous competition featuring the world’s best martial artists. Following close behind him is Zheng, a rebel monk looking to save Jin from his own inner demons. While on the surface Tekken appears to be the corporation of the future, Jin and Zheng expose a dark underbelly that could threaten the very threads of humanity.&#34;

On December 20, 2007, it was announced that Dwight Little has signed on to direct the film. Little commented on the plot for the movie saying that: &#34;The film plays out as a science fiction story set in the near future, about a rebel who rises up against the Tekken Corp. to seize freedom for his people. It&#39;s a gladiator story, but the videogame has a complicated enough storyline that it provides the template for a martial arts spectacular.&#34; <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>.
