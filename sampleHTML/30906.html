<p>A <b>transformer</b> is a device that transfers <a href="/wiki/Electrical_energy" id="w">electrical energy</a> from one <a href="/wiki/Electrical_network" id="w">circuit</a> to another through <a href="/wiki/Inductive_coupling" id="w">inductively coupled</a> wires. A changing <a href="/wiki/Electric_current" id="w">current</a> in the first circuit (the <i>primary</i>) creates a changing magnetic field; in turn, this magnetic field <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction" id="w">induces</a> a changing voltage in the second circuit (the <i>secondary</i>). By adding a <a href="/wiki/Electrical_load" id="w">load</a> to the secondary circuit, one can make current flow in the transformer, thus transferring energy from one circuit to the other.</p>
<p>The secondary induced voltage <i>V<sub>S</sub></i> is scaled from the primary <i>V<sub>P</sub></i> by a factor ideally equal to the ratio of the number of turns of wire in their respective windings:</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">
\frac{V_{S}}{V_{P}} = \frac{N_{S}}{N_{P}}
</span></dd></dl>
<p>By appropriate selection of the numbers of turns, a transformer thus allows an <a href="/wiki/Alternating_current" id="w">alternating voltage</a> to be stepped up &#8212; by making <i>N<sub>S</sub></i> more than <i>N<sub>P</sub></i> &#8212; or stepped down, by making it less.</p>
<p>A key application of transformers is to reduce the current before transmitting electrical energy over long distances through wires. Most wires have <a href="/wiki/Electrical_resistance" id="w">resistance</a> and so dissipate electrical energy at a rate proportional to the square of the current through the wire.  By transforming electrical power to a high-voltage, and therefore low-current form for transmission and back again afterwards, transformers enable the economic <a href="/wiki/Electric_power_transmission" id="w">transmission of power</a> over long distances. Consequently, transformers have shaped the <a href="/wiki/Electrical_power_industry" id="w">electricity supply industry</a>, permitting <a href="/wiki/Electrical_generator" id="w">generation</a> to be located remotely from points of <a href="/wiki/Electrical_load" id="w">demand</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> All but a fraction of the world&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Electric_power" id="w">electrical power</a> has passed through a series of transformers by the time it reaches the consumer.<sup id="_ref-nailen_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nailen" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Transformers are some of the most <a href="/wiki/Electrical_efficiency" id="w">efficient</a> electrical &#39;machines&#39;,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> with some large units able to transfer 99.75% of their input power to their output.<sup id="_ref-energie_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-energie" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Transformers come in a range of sizes from a thumbnail-sized coupling transformer hidden inside a stage <a href="/wiki/Microphone" id="w">microphone</a> to huge units weighing hundreds of tonnes used to interconnect portions of national <a href="/wiki/Power_grid" id="w">power grids</a>. All operate with the same basic principles, though a variety of designs exist to perform specialized roles throughout home and industry.

<a id="Basic_principles" name="Basic_principles"></a><h2>Basic principles</h2>

<p>The transformer is based on two principles: first, that an <a href="/wiki/Electric_current" id="w">electric current</a> can produce a <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_field" id="w">magnetic field</a> (<a href="/wiki/Electromagnetism" id="w">electromagnetism</a>) and, second, that a changing magnetic field within a coil of wire induces a voltage across the ends of the coil (<a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction" id="w">electromagnetic induction</a>).  By changing the current in the primary coil, one changes the strength of its magnetic field; since the secondary coil is wrapped around the same magnetic field, a voltage is induced across the secondary.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">An ideal step-down transformer showing magnetic flux in the core</div></div>
</p>
<p>A simplified transformer design is shown to the right.  A current passing through the primary coil creates a <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_field" id="w">magnetic field</a>. The primary and secondary coils are wrapped around a core of very high <a href="/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)" id="w">magnetic permeability</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Iron" id="w">iron</a>; this ensures that most of the magnetic field lines produced by the primary current are within the iron and pass  through the secondary coil as well as the primary coil.</p>
<a id="Induction_law" name="Induction_law"></a><h3>Induction law</h3>

<p>The voltage induced across the secondary coil may be calculated from <a href="/wiki/Faraday%26%2339%3Bs_law_of_induction" id="w">Faraday&#39;s law of induction</a>, which states that </p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">
V_{S} = N_{S} \frac{d\Phi}{dt}
</span></dd></dl>
<p>where <i>V<sub>S</sub></i> is the instantaneous <a href="/wiki/Voltage" id="w">voltage</a>, <i>N</i><sub><i>S</i></sub> is the number of turns in the secondary coil and <i>Î¦</i> equals the total <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_flux" id="w">magnetic flux</a> through one turn of the coil.  If the turns of the coil are oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field lines, the flux is the product of the <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_field" id="w">magnetic field</a> strength <i>B</i> and the area <i>A</i> through which it cuts.  The area is constant, being equal to the cross-sectional area of the transformer core, whereas the magnetic field varies with time according to the excitation of the primary.  </p>
<p>Since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary coils in an ideal transformer,<sup id="_ref-flanagan_p2.1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-flanagan_p2.1" title="">[5]</a></sup> the instantaneous voltage across the primary winding equals </p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">
V_{P} = N_{P} \frac{d\Phi}{dt}
</span></dd></dl>
<p>Taking the ratio of the two equations for <i>V<sub>S</sub></i> and <i>V<sub>P</sub></i> gives the basic equation<sup id="_ref-winders_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-winders" title="">[6]</a></sup> for stepping up or stepping down the voltage</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">

<div class="thumbcaption">The ideal transformer as a circuit element</div></div>
</p>
<p>If the secondary coil is attached to a load that allows current to flow, electrical power is transmitted from the primary circuit to the secondary circuit.  Ideally, the transformer is perfectly efficient; all the incoming energy is transformed from the primary circuit to the <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_field" id="w">magnetic field</a> and thence to the secondary circuit.  If this condition is met, the incoming <a href="/wiki/Electric_power" id="w">electric power</a> must equal the outgoing power</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">
P_{\mathrm{incoming}} = I_{P} V_{P} = P_{\mathrm{outgoing}} = I_{S} V_{S}

<p>giving the ideal transformer equation</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">
\frac{V_{S}}{V_{P}} = \frac{N_{S}}{N_{P}} = \frac{I_{P}}{I_{S}}
</span></dd></dl>
<p>Thus, if the voltage is stepped up (<i>V<sub>S</sub></i> &#62; <i>V<sub>P</sub></i>), then the current is stepped down (<i>I<sub>S</sub></i> &#60; <i>I<sub>P</sub></i>) by the same factor.  In practice, most transformers are very efficient (see below), so that this formula is a good approximation.</p>
<p>The impedance in one circuit is transformed by the <i>square</i> of the turns ratio.<sup id="_ref-flanagan_p2.1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-flanagan_p2.1" title="">[5]</a></sup> For example, if an impedance <i>Z<sub>S</sub></i> is attached across the terminals of the secondary coil, it appears to the primary circuit to have an impedance of <span class="math">Z_S\!\left(\!\tfrac{N_P}{N_S}\!\right)^2\!\!</span>. This relationship is reciprocal, so that the impedance <i>Z<sub>P</sub></i> of the primary circuit appears to the secondary to be <span class="math">Z_P\!\left(\!\tfrac{N_S}{N_P}\!\right)^2\!\!</span>.</p>
<a id="Technical_discussion" name="Technical_discussion"></a><h3>Technical discussion</h3>
<p>The simplified description above avoids several complicating factors, in particular the primary current required to establish a magnetic field in the core, and the contribution to the field due to current in the secondary circuit.</p>
<p>Models of an ideal transformer typically assume a core of negligible <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_reluctance" id="w">reluctance</a> with two windings of zero <a href="/wiki/Electrical_resistance" id="w">resistance</a>.<sup id="_ref-say_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-say" title="">[7]</a></sup> When a voltage is applied to the primary winding, a small current flows, driving  <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_flux" id="w">flux</a> around the <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_circuit" id="w">magnetic circuit</a> of the core.<sup id="_ref-say_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-say" title="">[7]</a></sup>. The current required to create the flux is termed the <i>magnetising current</i>; since the ideal core has been assumed to have near-zero reluctance, the magnetising current is negligible, although a presence is still required to create the magnetic field. </p>
<p>The changing magnetic field induces an <a href="/wiki/Electromotive_force" id="w">electromotive force</a> (EMF) across each winding.<sup id="_ref-J&P_p2-3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-J&P_p2-3" title="">[8]</a></sup> Since the ideal windings have no impedance, they have no associated voltage drop, and so the voltages V<sub>P</sub> and V<sub>S</sub> measured at the terminals of the transformer, are equal to the corresponding EMFs. The primary EMF, acting as it does in opposition to the primary voltage, is sometimes termed the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Counter-electromotive_force" id="w">back EMF</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-calvert_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-calvert" title="">[9]</a></sup> This is due to <a href="/wiki/Lenz%26%2339%3Bs_law" id="w">Lenz&#39;s law</a> which states that the induction of EMF would always be such that it will oppose development of any such change in magnetic field.</p>

</p><a id="Flux_leakage" name="Flux_leakage"></a><h3>Flux leakage</h3>
<p>{{main}}
The ideal transformer model assumes that all flux generated by the primary winding links all the turns of every winding, including itself. In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings.<sup id="_ref-mclaren_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mclaren" title="">[10]</a></sup> Such flux is termed <i>leakage flux</i>, and manifests itself as <a href="/wiki/Self-inductance" id="w">self-inductance</a> in <a href="/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits" id="w">series</a> with the mutually coupled transformer windings.<sup id="_ref-calvert_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-calvert" title="">[9]</a></sup> Leakage results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_field" id="w">magnetic fields</a> with each cycle of the power supply. It is not itself directly a source of power loss, but results in poorer <a href="/wiki/Voltage_regulation" id="w">voltage regulation</a>, causing the secondary voltage to fail to be directly proportional to the primary, particularly under heavy load.<sup id="_ref-mclaren_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mclaren" title="">[10]</a></sup> Distribution transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low <a href="/wiki/Leakage_inductance" id="w">leakage inductance</a>. </p>
<p>However, in some applications, leakage can be a desirable property, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may be deliberately introduced to a transformer&#39;s design to limit the <a href="/wiki/Short-circuit" id="w">short-circuit</a> current it will supply.<sup id="_ref-calvert_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-calvert" title="">[9]</a></sup> Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit <a href="/wiki/Negative_resistance" id="w">negative resistance</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Electric_arc" id="w">electric arcs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mercury_vapor_lamp" id="w">mercury vapor lamps</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Neon_sign" id="w">neon signs</a>; or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as <a href="/wiki/Arc_welding" id="w">electric arc welders</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Air gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency transformers that have a DC component added.</p>
<a id="Effect_of_frequency" name="Effect_of_frequency"></a><h3>Effect of frequency</h3>
<p>The time-derivative term in <a href="/wiki/Faraday%26%2339%3Bs_law_of_induction" id="w">Faraday&#39;s Law</a> shows that the flux in the core is the <a href="/wiki/Integral" id="w">integral</a> of the applied voltage.<sup id="_ref-dixon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dixon" title="">[12]</a></sup> An ideal transformer would, at least hypothetically, work under direct-current excitation, with the core flux increasing linearly with time.<sup id="_ref-billings_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-billings" title="">[13]</a></sup> In practice, the flux would rise very rapidly to the point where <a href="/wiki/Saturation_(magnetic)" id="w">magnetic saturation</a> of the core occurred, causing a huge increase in the magnetising current and overheating the transformer. All practical transformers must therefore operate under alternating (or pulsed) current conditions.<sup id="_ref-billings_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-billings" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<b>Transformer universal EMF equation</b>

If the flux in the core is <a href="/wiki/Sinusoidal" id="w">sinusoidal</a>, the relationship for either winding between its <a href="/wiki/Root_mean_square" id="w">rms</a> EMF <i>E</i>, and the supply frequency <i>f</i>, number of turns <i>N</i>, core cross-sectional area <i>a</i> and peak <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_flux_density" id="w">magnetic flux density</a> <i>B</i> is given by the universal EMF equation:<sup id="_ref-say_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-say" title="">[7]</a></sup>

<p /></div>
<p>The EMF of a transformer at a given flux density increases with frequency, an effect predicted by the <a href="/wiki/Transformer#Transformer universal EMF equation" id="w">universal transformer EMF equation</a>.<sup id="_ref-say_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-say" title="">[7]</a></sup>  By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation, and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance. However properties such as core loss and conductor <a href="/wiki/Skin_effect" id="w">skin effect</a> also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment traditionally employ 400&#160;Hz power supplies which are less efficient but this is more than offset by the reduction in core and winding weight.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In general, operation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetising current. At a frequency lower than the design value, with the rated voltage applied, the magnetising current may increase to an excessive level. Operation of a transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. For example, transformers may need to be equipped with &#34;volts per hertz&#34; over-excitation <a href="/wiki/Relay" id="w">relays</a> to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.</p>
<p>Knowledge of natural frequencies of transformer windings is of importance for the determination of the transient response of the windings to impulse and switching surge voltages.

<a id="Energy_losses" name="Energy_losses"></a><h3>Energy losses</h3>
<p>An ideal transformer would have no energy losses, and would therefore be 100% efficient. Despite the transformer being amongst the most efficient of electrical machines, with experimental models using <a href="/wiki/Superconductivity" id="w">superconducting</a> windings achieving efficiencies of 99.85%,<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> energy is dissipated in the windings, core, and surrounding structures. Larger transformers are generally more efficient, and those rated for electricity distribution usually perform better than 95%.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> A small transformer, such as a plug-in &#34;power brick&#34; used for low-power consumer electronics, may be no more than 85% efficient; although individual power loss is small, the aggregate losses from the very large number of such devices is coming under increased scrutiny.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Transformer losses are attributable to several causes and may be differentiated between those originating in the windings, sometimes termed <i><a href="/wiki/Copper_loss" id="w">copper loss</a></i>, and those arising from the magnetic circuit, sometimes termed <i><a href="/wiki/Iron_loss" id="w">iron loss</a></i>. The losses vary with load current, and may furthermore be expressed as &#34;no-load&#34; or &#34;full-load&#34; loss, respectively.  Winding <a href="/wiki/Electrical_resistance" id="w">resistance</a> dominates load losses, whereas <a href="/wiki/Hysteresis" id="w">hysteresis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eddy_current" id="w">eddy currents</a> losses contribute to over 99% of the no-load loss. The no-load loss can be significant, meaning that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on an electrical supply, and lending impetus to development of low-loss transformers (also see <a href="/wiki/Energy_efficient_transformer" id="w">energy efficient transformer</a>).<sup id="_ref-j&p_p41-42_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-j&p_p41-42" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

An <a href="/wiki/Autotransformer" id="w">autotransformer</a> has only a single winding with two end terminals, plus a third at an intermediate tap point. The primary voltage is applied across two of the terminals, and the secondary voltage taken from one of these and the third terminal. The primary and secondary circuits therefore have a number of windings turns in common.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> Since the volts-per-turn is the same in both windings, each develops a voltage in proportion to its number of turns.

<a id="Resonant_transformers" name="Resonant_transformers"></a><h3> Resonant transformers </h3>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Electrical_resonance" id="w">resonant</a> transformer uses the inductance of its windings in combination with external capacitors connected in series or parallel with the windings, and/or the capacitance of the windings themselves, to create one or more <a href="/wiki/Resonant_circuit" id="w">resonant circuits</a>.  For example, it may use the inductance of the primary winding in series with a capacitor.  Resonance can aid in achieving a very high voltage across the secondary. Resonant transformers such as the <a href="/wiki/Tesla_coil" id="w">Tesla coil</a> can generate very high voltages, and are able to provide much higher current than electrostatic high-voltage generation machines such as the <a href="/wiki/Van_de_Graaff_generator" id="w">Van de Graaff generator</a>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Another application of the resonant transformer is to couple between stages of a <a href="/wiki/Superheterodyne_receiver" id="w">superheterodyne receiver</a>, where the selectivity of the receiver is provided by tuned transformers in the intermediate-frequency amplifiers.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Leakage_transformers" name="Leakage_transformers"></a><h3> Leakage transformers </h3>
<p>A leakage transformer, also called a stray-field transformer, has a significantly higher <a href="/wiki/Leakage_inductance" id="w">leakage inductance</a> than other transformers, sometimes increased by a magnetic bypass or shunt in its core between primary and secondary, which is sometimes adjustable with a set screw. This provides a transformer with an inherent current limitation due to the loose coupling between its primary and the secondary windings. The output and input currents are low enough to prevent thermal overload under all load conditions &#8211; even if the secondary is shorted.</p>
<p>Leakage transformers are used for <a href="/wiki/Arc_welding" id="w">arc welding</a> and high voltage discharge lamps (<a href="/wiki/Cold_cathode_fluorescent_lamp" id="w">cold cathode fluorescent lamps</a>, which are series-connected up to 7.5&#160;kV AC). It acts then both as a voltage transformer and as a <a href="/wiki/Electrical_ballast#Reactive_ballasts" id="w">magnetic ballast</a>.</p>

</p><a id="Laminated_steel_cores" name="Laminated_steel_cores"></a><h4> Laminated steel cores </h4>
<p>Transformers for use at power or audio frequencies typically have cores made of high <a href="/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)" id="w">permeability</a> <a href="/wiki/Silicon_steel" id="w">silicon steel</a>.<sup id="_ref-hindmarsh_29-31_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hindmarsh_29-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> The steel has a permeability many times that of <a href="/wiki/Free_space" id="w">free space</a>, and the core thus serves to greatly reduce the magnetising current, and confine the flux to a path which closely couples the windings.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Early transformer developers soon realised that cores constructed from solid iron resulted in prohibitive eddy-current losses, and their designs mitigated this effect with cores consisting of bundles of insulated iron wires.<sup id="_ref-allan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-allan" title="">[33]</a></sup> Later designs constructed the core by stacking layers of thin steel laminations, a principle that has remained in use. Each lamination is insulated from its neighbors by a thin non-conducting layer of insulation.<sup id="_ref-k&k_p36-7_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-k&k_p36-7" title="">[24]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Transformer#Transformer universal EMF equation" id="w">universal transformer equation</a> indicates a minimum cross-sectional area for the core to avoid saturation.</p>
<p>The effect of laminations is to confine eddy currents to highly elliptical paths that enclose little flux, and so reduce their magnitude. Thinner laminations reduce losses,<sup id="_ref-hindmarsh_29-31_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hindmarsh_29-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> but are more laborious and expensive to construct.<sup id="_ref-mcLyman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcLyman" title="">[34]</a></sup> Thin laminations are generally used on high frequency transformers, with some types of very thin steel laminations able to operate up to 10&#160;kHz. </p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Laminating the core greatly reduces eddy-current losses</div></div>

One common design of laminated core is made from interleaved stacks of <a href="/wiki/E-shaped" id="w">E-shaped</a> steel sheets capped with <a href="/wiki/I-shaped" id="w">I-shaped</a> pieces, leading to its name of &#34;E-I transformer&#34;.<sup id="_ref-mcLyman_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcLyman" title="">[34]</a></sup> Such a design tends to exhibit more losses, but is very economical to manufacture. The cut-core or C-core type is made by winding a steel strip around a rectangular form and then bonding the layers together. It is then cut in two, forming two C shapes, and the core assembled by binding the two C halves together with a steel strap.<sup id="_ref-mcLyman_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcLyman" title="">[34]</a></sup> They have the advantage that the flux is always oriented parallel to the metal grains, reducing reluctance.</p>
<p>A steel core&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Remanence" id="w">remanence</a> means that it retains a static magnetic field when power is removed. When power is then reapplied, the residual field will cause a high <a href="/wiki/Inrush_current" id="w">inrush current</a> until the effect of the remanent magnetism is reduced, usually after a few cycles of the applied alternating current.<sup id="_ref-harlow_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harlow" title="">[35]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Relay" id="w">Overcurrent protection</a> devices such as <a href="/wiki/Fuse_(electrical)" id="w">fuses</a> must be selected to allow this harmless inrush to pass. On transformers connected to long, overhead power transmission lines, induced currents due to <a href="/wiki/Geomagnetically_induced_current" id="w">geomagnetic disturbances</a> during <a href="/wiki/Solar_storm" id="w">solar storms</a> can cause saturation of the core and operation of transformer protection devices.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Distribution transformers can achieve low no-load losses by using cores made with low-loss high-permeability <a href="/wiki/Silicon_steel" id="w">silicon steel</a> or <a href="/wiki/Amorphous#Metallic glass" id="w">amorphous (non-crystalline) metal alloy</a>. The higher initial cost of the core material is offset over the life of the transformer by its lower losses at light load.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Solid_cores" name="Solid_cores"></a><h4> Solid cores </h4>
<p>Powdered <a href="/wiki/Iron" id="w">iron</a> cores are used in circuits (such as switch-mode power supplies) that operate above main frequencies and up to a few tens of kilohertz. These materials combine high magnetic <a href="/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)" id="w">permeability</a> with high bulk electrical <a href="/wiki/Resistivity" id="w">resistivity</a>. For frequencies extending beyond the <a href="/wiki/Very_high_frequency" id="w">VHF band</a>, cores made from non-conductive magnetic <a href="/wiki/Ceramic" id="w">ceramic</a> materials called <a href="/wiki/Ferrite_(magnet)" id="w">ferrites</a> are common.<sup id="_ref-mcLyman_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcLyman" title="">[34]</a></sup> Some radio-frequency transformers also have moveable cores (sometimes called &#39;slugs&#39;) which allow adjustment of the coupling coefficient (and bandwidth) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.</p>
<a id="Toroidal_cores" name="Toroidal_cores"></a><h4> Toroidal cores </h4>

<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Small_toroidal_transformer.jpg" title="Small transformer with toroidal core"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_toroidal_transformer.jpg" alt="Small transformer with toroidal core" title="Small transformer with toroidal core" class="location-right type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Small transformer with toroidal core</div>
Toroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which, depending on operating frequency, is made from a long strip of silicon <a href="/wiki/Steel" id="w">steel</a> or <a href="/wiki/Permalloy" id="w">permalloy</a> wound into a coil, powdered iron, or <a href="/wiki/Ferrite_(magnet)" id="w">ferrite</a>.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> A strip construction ensures that the <a href="/wiki/Grain_boundary" id="w">grain boundaries</a> are optimally aligned, improving the transformer&#39;s efficiency by reducing the core&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Reluctance" id="w">reluctance</a>. The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimises the length of wire needed, and also provides screening to minimize the core&#39;s magnetic field from generating <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference" id="w">electromagnetic interference</a>.  </p>
<p>Toroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited rating. </p>
<p>Ferrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to a megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of <a href="/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply" id="w">switch-mode power supplies</a>. A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher cost of windings. As a consequence, toroidal transformers are uncommon above ratings of a few kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.</p>
<a id="Air_cores" name="Air_cores"></a><h4> Air cores </h4>
<p>A physical core is not an absolute requisite and a functioning transformer can be produced simply by placing the windings in close proximity to each other, an arrangement termed an &#34;air-core&#34; transformer. The air which comprises the magnetic circuit is essentially lossless, and so an air-core transformer eliminates loss due to <a href="/wiki/Hysteresis" id="w">hysteresis</a> in the core material.<sup id="_ref-calvert_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-calvert" title="">[9]</a></sup> The leakage inductance is inevitably high, resulting in very poor regulation, and so such designs are unsuitable for use in power distribution.<sup id="_ref-calvert_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-calvert" title="">[9]</a></sup> They have however very high <a href="/wiki/Bandwidth" id="w">bandwidth</a>, and are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications,<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> for which a satisfactory coupling coefficient is maintained by carefully overlapping the primary and secondary windings.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Electrical_conductor" id="w">conducting material</a> used for the windings depends upon the application, but in all cases the individual turns must be electrically insulated from each other to ensure that the current travels throughout every turn.<sup id="_ref-dixon_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dixon" title="">[12]</a></sup> For small power and signal transformers, in which currents are low and the potential difference between adjacent turns is small, the coils are often wound from <a href="/wiki/Enameled_wire" id="w">enamelled magnet wire</a>, such as Formvar wire. Larger power transformers operating at high voltages may be wound with copper rectangular strip conductors insulated by oil-impregnated paper and blocks of <a href="/wiki/Transformerboard" id="w">pressboard</a>.<sup id="_ref-cegb_1982_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cegb_1982" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>High-frequency transformers operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided <a href="/wiki/Skin_effect#Mitigation" id="w">litz wire</a> to minimize the skin-effect and <a href="/wiki/Proximity_effect" id="w">proximity effect</a> losses.<sup id="_ref-dixon_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dixon" title="">[12]</a></sup> Large power transformers use multiple-stranded conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings.<sup id="_ref-cegb_1982_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cegb_1982" title="">[41]</a></sup> Each strand is individually insulated, and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.<sup id="_ref-cegb_1982_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cegb_1982" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>For signal transformers, the windings may be arranged in a way to minimise leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high-frequency response. This can be done by splitting up each coil into sections, and those sections placed in layers between the sections of the other winding. This is known as a stacked type or interleaved winding.</p>
<p>Both the primary and secondary windings on power transformers may have external connections, called <a href="/wiki/Tap_(transformer)" id="w">taps</a>, to intermediate points on the winding to allow selection of the voltage ratio. The taps may be connected to an automatic on-load <a href="/wiki/Tap_changer" id="w">tap changer</a> for voltage regulation of distribution circuits. Audio-frequency transformers, used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers, have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker. A <a href="/wiki/Center_tap" id="w">center-tapped transformer</a> is often used in the output stage of an audio power <a href="/wiki/Amplifier" id="w">amplifier</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Push-pull_converter" id="w">push-pull circuit</a>. Modulation transformers in <a href="/wiki/Amplitude_modulation" id="w">AM</a> transmitters are very similar.</p>
<p>Certain transformers have the windings protected by epoxy resin. By <a href="/wiki/Resin_casting" id="w">impregnating</a> the transformer with epoxy under a <a href="/wiki/Vacuum" id="w">vacuum</a>, one can replace air spaces within the windings with epoxy, thus sealing the windings and helping to prevent the possible formation of corona and absorption of dirt or water.

<p>Very small transformers will have wire leads connected directly to the ends of the coils, and brought out to the base of the unit for circuit connections. Larger transformers may have heavy bolted terminals, bus bars or high-voltage insulated <a href="/wiki/Bushing_(electrical)" id="w">bushings</a> made of polymers or porcelain. A large bushing can be a complex structure since it must provide careful control of the <a href="/wiki/Electric_field_gradient" id="w">electric field gradient</a> without letting the transformer leak oil.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>The transformer principle was demonstrated in 1831 by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Faraday" id="w">Michael Faraday</a>, although he used it only to demonstrate the principle of <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction" id="w">electromagnetic induction</a> and did not foresee its practical uses. Viable designs would not appear until the 1880s.<sup id="_ref-Coltman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Coltman" title="">[50]</a></sup>  Within less than a decade, the transformer was instrumental during the &#34;<a href="/wiki/War_of_Currents" id="w">War of Currents</a>&#34; in seeing <a href="/wiki/Alternating_current" id="w">alternating current</a> systems triumph over their <a href="/wiki/Direct_current" id="w">direct current</a> counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant. </p>
<p><sup id="_ref-Coltman_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Coltman" title="">[50]</a></sup> Russian engineer <a href="/wiki/Pavel_Yablochkov" id="w">Pavel Yablochkov</a> in 1876 invented a lighting system based on a set of <a href="/wiki/Induction_coil" id="w">induction coils</a>, where primary windings were connected to a source of alternating current and secondary windings could be connected to several <a href="/wiki/Yablochkov_candle" id="w">&#34;electric candles&#34;</a>. The patent claimed the system could &#34;provide separate supply to several lighting fixtures with different luminous intensities from a single source of electric power&#34;. Evidently, the induction coil in this system operated as a transformer.  </p>

<p><a href="/wiki/William_Stanley_(physicist)" id="w">William Stanley</a>, an engineer for Westinghouse, built the first commercial device in 1885 after George Westinghouse had bought Gaulard and Gibbs&#39; patents.

<p>While new technologies have made transformers in some electronics applications obsolete, transformers are still found in many electronic devices. Transformers are essential for high voltage <a href="/wiki/Power_transmission" id="w">power transmission</a>, which makes long distance transmission economically practical.</p>
