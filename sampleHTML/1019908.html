<a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>HPAI A(H5N1) is an avian disease. There is no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission or of <a href="/wiki/Airborne_transmission" id="w">airborne transmission</a> of HPAI A(H5N1) to humans. In almost all cases, those infected with H5N1 had extensive physical contact with infected birds. Still, around 60% of humans known to have been infected with the current Asian strain of HPAI A(H5N1) have died from it, and H5N1 may <a href="/wiki/Mutation" id="w">mutate</a> or <a href="/wiki/Reassortment" id="w">reassort</a> into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. In 2003, world-renowned virologist <a href="/wiki/Robert_Webster" id="w">Robert Webster</a> published an article titled &#34;The world is teetering on the edge of a pandemic that could kill a large fraction of the human population&#34; in <i><a href="/wiki/American_Scientist" id="w">American Scientist</a></i>.

<p>Due to the high lethality and <a href="/wiki/Virulence" id="w">virulence</a> of HPAI A(H5N1), its endemic presence, its increasingly large <a href="/wiki/Host_(biology)" id="w">host</a> reservoir, and its significant ongoing mutations, the H5N1 virus is the world&#39;s largest current pandemic threat, and billions of dollars are being spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential <a href="/wiki/Influenza_pandemic" id="w">influenza pandemic</a>.<sup id="_ref-Rosenthal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rosenthal" title="">[5]</a></sup> At least 12 companies and 17 governments are developing pre-pandemic <a href="/wiki/Influenza_vaccine" id="w">influenza vaccines</a> in 28 different clinical trials that, if successful, could turn a deadly pandemic infection into a nondeadly one.

The first known strain of HPAI A(H5N1) (called A/chicken/Scotland/59) killed two flocks of chickens in Scotland in 1959; but that strain was very different from the current highly pathogenic strain of H5N1. The dominant strain of HPAI A(H5N1) in 2004 <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">evolved</a> from 1999 to 2002 creating the Z genotype.<sup id="_ref-Harder_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Harder" title="">[11]</a></sup> It has also been called &#34;Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1)&#34;.</p>
<p>Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1) is divided into two <a href="/wiki/Antigen" id="w">antigenic</a> clades. &#34;Clade 1 includes human and bird isolates from <a href="/wiki/Vietnam" id="w">Vietnam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thailand" id="w">Thailand</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cambodia" id="w">Cambodia</a> and bird isolates from <a href="/wiki/Laos" id="w">Laos</a> and <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" id="w">Malaysia</a>. Clade 2 viruses were first identified in bird isolates from <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" id="w">Indonesia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>, and <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" id="w">South Korea</a> before spreading westward to the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" id="w">Middle East</a>, <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a>. The clade 2 viruses have been primarily responsible for human H5N1 infections that have occurred during late 2005 and 2006, according to WHO. Genetic analysis has identified six subclades of clade 2, three of which have a distinct geographic distribution and have been implicated in human infections: <span class="image"><img alt="Map" rel="nofollow" src="http://content.nejm.org/content/vol355/issue21/images/large/03f1.jpeg" /></span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Subclade 1, Indonesia</li>
<li>Subclade 2, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (called EMA)</li>
<li>Subclade 3, China&#34;<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p />
<p>A 2007 study focused on the EMA subclade has shed further light on the EMA mutations. &#34;The 36 new isolates reported here greatly expand the amount of whole-genome sequence data available from recent avian influenza (H5N1) isolates. Before our project, GenBank contained only 5 other complete genomes from Europe for the 2004–2006 period, and it contained no whole genomes from the Middle East or northern Africa. Our analysis showed several new findings. First, all European, Middle Eastern, and African samples fall into a clade that is distinct from other contemporary Asian clades, all of which share common ancestry with the original 1997 Hong Kong strain. Phylogenetic trees built on each of the 8 segments show a consistent picture of 3 lineages, as illustrated by the HA tree shown in Figure 1. Two of the clades contain exclusively Vietnamese isolates; the smaller of these, with 5 isolates, we label V1; the larger clade, with 9 isolates, is V2. The remaining 22 isolates all fall into a third, clearly distinct clade, labeled EMA, which comprises samples from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Trees for the other 7 segments display a similar topology, with clades V1, V2, and EMA clearly separated in each case. Analyses of all available complete influenza (H5N1) genomes and of 589 HA sequences placed the EMA clade as distinct from the major clades circulating in People&#39;s Republic of China, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia.&#34;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>As with other avian flu viruses, H5N1 has strains called &#34;highly pathogenic&#34; (HP) and &#34;low-pathogenic&#34; (LP). Avian influenza viruses that cause HPAI are highly <a href="/wiki/Virulence" id="w">virulent</a>, and mortality rates in infected flocks often approach 100%. LPAI viruses have negligible virulence, but these viruses can serve as progenitors to HPAI viruses. The current strain of H5N1 responsible for the deaths of birds across the world is an HPAI strain; all other current strains of H5N1, including a North American strain that causes no disease at all in any species, are LPAI strains. All HPAI strains identified to date have involved H5 and H7 subtypes. The distinction concerns pathogenicity in poultry, not humans. Normally a highly pathogenic avian virus is not highly pathogenic to either humans or non-poultry birds. This current deadly strain of H5N1 is unusual in being deadly to so many species, including some, like domestic cats, never previously susceptible to any <a href="/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae" id="w">influenza virus</a>.</p>

<a id="Low_pathogenic_H5N1" name="Low_pathogenic_H5N1"></a><h3>Low pathogenic H5N1</h3>
<p>Low pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (LPAI H5N1) also called &#34;North American&#34; H5N1 commonly occurs in wild birds. In most cases, it causes minor sickness or no noticeable signs of disease in birds. It is not known to affect humans at all. The only concern about it is that it is possible for it to be transmitted to poultry and in poultry mutate into a highly pathogenic strain.</p>

<ul>
<li>1975 – LPAI H5N1 was detected in a wild mallard duck and a wild blue goose in Wisconsin.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>1981 and 1985 – LPAI H5N1 was detected in ducks by the University of Minnesota conducting a sampling procedure in which sentinel ducks were monitored in cages placed in the wild for a short period of time.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>1983 – LPAI H5N1 was detected in ring-billed gulls in Pennsylvania.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>1986 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in a wild mallard duck in Ohio.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>2005 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in ducks in Manitoba, Canada.</li></ul>
<p>&#34;In the past, there was no requirement for reporting or tracking LPAI H5 or H7 detections in wild birds so states and universities tested wild bird samples independently of USDA. Because of this, the above list of previous detections might not be all inclusive of past LPAI H5N1 detections. However, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) recently changed its requirement of reporting detections of avian influenza. Effective in 2006, all confirmed LPAI H5 and H7 AI subtypes must be reported to the OIE because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains. Therefore, USDA now tracks these detections in wild birds, backyard flocks, commercial flocks and live bird markets.&#34;<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

<p>H5N1 is easily transmissible between birds facilitating a potential <a href="/wiki/Global_spread_of_H5N1" id="w">global spread of H5N1</a>. While H5N1 undergoes mutation and reassortment, creating variations which can infect species not previously known to carry the virus, not all of these variant forms can infect humans. H5N1 as an avian virus preferentially binds to a type of <a href="/wiki/Galactose" id="w">galactose</a> receptors that populate the avian respiratory tract from the nose to the lungs and are virtually absent in humans, occurring only in and around the <a href="/wiki/Alveoli" id="w">alveoli</a>, structures deep in the lungs where oxygen is passed to the blood. Therefore, the virus is not easily expelled by coughing and sneezing, the usual route of transmission.<sup id="_ref-Shinya_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shinya" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Riel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Riel" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Forbes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Forbes" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p>Infected birds transmit H5N1 through their <a href="/wiki/Saliva" id="w">saliva</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mucus" id="w">nasal secretions</a>, <a href="/wiki/Feces" id="w">feces</a> and <a href="/wiki/Blood" id="w">blood</a>. Other animals may become infected with the virus through direct contact with these bodily fluids or through contact with surfaces contaminated with them. H5N1 remains infectious after over 30 days at 0 °C ( 32.0 °F) (over one month at freezing temperature) or 6 days at 37 °C ( 98.6 °F) (one week at human body temperature) so at ordinary temperatures it lasts in the environment for weeks. In Arctic temperatures, it doesn&#39;t degrade at all.</p>
<p>Because migratory birds are among the carriers of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, it is spreading to all parts of the world. H5N1 is different from all previously known highly pathogenic avian flu viruses in its ability to be spread by animals other than poultry.</p>
<p>In October 2004, researchers discovered that H5N1 is far more dangerous than was previously believed. <a href="/wiki/Waterfowl" id="w">Waterfowl</a> were revealed to be directly spreading the highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 to <a href="/wiki/Chicken" id="w">chickens</a>, <a href="/wiki/Crow" id="w">crows</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pigeon" id="w">pigeons</a>, and other birds, and the virus was increasing its ability to infect mammals as well. From this point on, avian flu experts increasingly referred to containment as a strategy that can delay, but not ultimately prevent, a future avian flu pandemic.</p>
<p>&#34;Since 1997, studies of influenza A (H5N1) indicate that these viruses continue to evolve, with changes in antigenicity and internal gene constellations; an expanded host range in avian species and the ability to infect felids; enhanced pathogenicity in experimentally infected mice and ferrets, in which they cause systemic infections; and increased environmental stability.&#34;<sup id="_ref-biegel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-biegel" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>The New York Times</i>, in an article on transmission of H5N1 through smuggled birds, reports Wade Hagemeijer of Wetlands International stating, &#34;We believe it is spread by both bird migration and trade, but that trade, particularly illegal trade, is more important&#34;.<sup id="_ref-rosenthal2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rosenthal2" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>On August 22, 2007, a 28-year-old <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" id="w">Indonesian</a> chicken trader was the 2nd person to die of bird flu on the island of <a href="/wiki/Bali" id="w">Bali</a>, after 4 days of hospitalization, raising the death toll due to the disease in Indonesia to 84. Tests in 2 local laboratories were positive for the H5N1 strain of the disease. 194 people — the majority of them in Indonesia -- have died since 2003, according to the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" id="w">World Health Organization</a>. <sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The H5N1 bird flu virus can also pass through a pregnant woman&#39;s placenta to infect the fetus, researchers reported on Thursday 27 Sep 2007.
They also found evidence of what doctors had long suspected -- that the virus not only affects the lungs, but also passes throughout the body into the gastrointestinal tract, the brain, liver, and blood cells.

<a id="High_mutation_rate" name="High_mutation_rate"></a><h3>High mutation rate</h3>
<p>Influenza viruses have a relatively high mutation rate that is characteristic of <a href="/wiki/RNA_virus" id="w">RNA viruses</a>.  The segmentation of its <a href="/wiki/Genome" id="w">genome</a> facilitates <a href="/wiki/Genetic_recombination" id="w">genetic recombination</a> by segment <a href="/wiki/Reassortment" id="w">reassortment</a> in hosts infected with two different influenza viruses at the same time.<sup id="_ref-WHOinfluenza_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WHOinfluenza" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Kou_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kou" title="">[26]</a></sup> A previously uncontagious strain may then be able to pass between humans, one of several possible paths to a pandemic.</p>
<p>The ability of various influenza strains to show species-selectivity is largely due to variation in the <a href="/wiki/Hemagglutinin" id="w">hemagglutinin</a> genes. Genetic <a href="/wiki/Mutation" id="w">mutations</a> in the hemagglutinin gene that cause single <a href="/wiki/Amino_acid" id="w">amino acid</a> substitutions can significantly alter the ability of viral hemagglutinin proteins to bind to <a href="/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)" id="w">receptors</a> on the surface of host cells. Such mutations in avian H5N1 viruses can change virus strains from being inefficient at infecting human cells to being as efficient in causing human infections as more common human influenza virus types.<sup id="_ref-Gambaryan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gambaryan" title="">[34]</a></sup> This doesn&#39;t mean that one amino acid substitution can cause a pandemic, but it does mean that one amino acid substitution can cause an avian flu virus that is not pathogenic in humans to become pathogenic in humans.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/H3N2" id="w">H3N2</a> (&#34;<a href="/wiki/Swine_flu" id="w">swine flu</a>&#34;) is endemic in pigs in China, and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. The dominant strain of annual flu virus in January 2006 was <a href="/wiki/H3N2" id="w">H3N2</a>, which is now resistant to the standard antiviral drugs <a href="/wiki/Amantadine" id="w">amantadine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rimantadine" id="w">rimantadine</a>. The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment is a major concern. If a reassortment in H5N1 occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype, or it could shift subtypes, as <a href="/wiki/H2N2" id="w">H2N2</a> did when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of <a href="/wiki/H3N2" id="w">H3N2</a>.</p>
<p>Both the <a href="/wiki/H2N2" id="w">H2N2</a> and <a href="/wiki/H3N2" id="w">H3N2</a> pandemic strains contained <a href="/wiki/Avian_influenza" id="w">avian influenza</a> virus RNA segments. &#34;While the pandemic human influenza viruses of 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) clearly arose through reassortment between human and avian viruses, the influenza virus causing the &#39;Spanish flu&#39; in 1918 appears to be entirely derived from an avian source&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Harder_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Harder" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Humans_and_H5N1" name="Humans_and_H5N1"></a><h2>Humans and H5N1</h2>
<p>The earliest infections of humans by H5N1 coincided with an <a href="/wiki/Epizootic" id="w">epizootic</a> (an epidemic in nonhumans) of H5N1 influenza in Hong Kong&#39;s poultry population. This <a href="/wiki/Panzootic" id="w">panzootic</a> (a disease affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area) outbreak was stopped by the killing of the entire domestic poultry population within the territory.</p>

<p>Avian influenza <a href="/wiki/Hemagglutinin" id="w">hemagglutinin</a> bind alpha 2-3 <a href="/wiki/Sialic_acid" id="w">sialic acid</a> receptors while human influenza <a href="/wiki/Hemagglutinin" id="w">hemagglutinin</a> bind alpha 2-6 sialic acid receptors. Usually other differences also exist. There is as yet no human form of H5N1, so all humans who have caught it so far have caught <b>avian</b> H5N1.</p>
<p>In general, humans who catch a humanized <a href="/wiki/Influenzavirus_A" id="w">Influenza A virus</a> (a <a href="/wiki/Human_flu" id="w">human flu</a> virus of type A) usually have symptoms that include <a href="/wiki/Fever" id="w">fever</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cough" id="w">cough</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sore_throat" id="w">sore throat</a>, <a href="/wiki/Myalgia" id="w">muscle aches</a>, <a href="/wiki/Conjunctivitis" id="w">conjunctivitis</a> and, in severe cases, breathing problems and <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" id="w">pneumonia</a> that may be fatal.  The severity of the infection depends to a large part on the state of the infected person&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Immune_system" id="w">immune system</a> and whether the victim has been exposed to the strain before (in which case they would be partially immune). No one knows if these or other symptoms will be the symptoms of a humanized <a href="/wiki/H5N1_flu" id="w">H5N1 flu</a>.</p>

Of particular concern is elevated levels of <a href="/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha" id="w">tumor necrosis factor-alpha</a>, a protein that is associated with tissue destruction at sites of infection and increased production of other cytokines. Flu virus-induced increases in the level of cytokines is also associated with flu symptoms including fever, chills, vomiting and headache. Tissue damage associated with pathogenic flu virus infection can ultimately result in death.<sup id="_ref-webster_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-webster" title="">[3]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Inflammation" id="w">inflammatory</a> cascade triggered by H5N1 has been called a &#39;<a href="/wiki/Cytokine_storm" id="w">cytokine storm</a>&#39; by some, because of what seems to be a <a href="/wiki/Positive_feedback" id="w">positive feedback</a> process of damage to the body resulting from <a href="/wiki/Immune_system" id="w">immune system</a> stimulation.

<p>There is no highly effective treatment for <a href="/wiki/H5N1_flu" id="w">H5N1 flu</a>, but <a href="/wiki/Oseltamivir" id="w">oseltamivir</a> (commercially marketed by <a href="/wiki/Hoffmann-La_Roche" id="w">Roche</a> as <b>Tamiflu</b>), can sometimes inhibit the influenza virus from spreading inside the user&#39;s body.  This drug has become a focus for some governments and organizations trying to be seen as making preparations for a possible H5N1 pandemic.<sup id="_ref-Tamiflu_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tamiflu" title="">[37]</a></sup> On April 20, 2006, Roche AG announced that a <a href="/wiki/Stockpile" id="w">stockpile</a> of three million treatment courses of Tamiflu is waiting at the disposal of the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" id="w">World Health Organization</a> to be used in case of a flu pandemic; separately Roche donated two million courses to the WHO for use in <a href="/wiki/Developing_nations" id="w">developing nations</a> that may be affected by such a pandemic but lack the ability to purchase large quantities of the drug.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>

</p><dl><dd>&#34;Even now, we remain unsure about Tamiflu&#39;s real effectiveness. As for a <a href="/wiki/Vaccine" id="w">vaccine</a>, work cannot start on it until the emergence of a new virus, and we predict it would take six to nine months to develop it.

<p>There are several H5N1 <a href="/wiki/Vaccine" id="w">vaccines</a> for several of the avian H5N1 varieties, but the continual mutation of H5N1 renders them of limited use to date:  while vaccines can sometimes provide  cross-protection against related flu strains, the best protection would be from a vaccine specifically produced for any future pandemic flu virus strain. Dr. Daniel Lucey, co-director of the Biohazardous Threats and Emerging Diseases graduate program at <a href="/wiki/Georgetown_University" id="w">Georgetown University</a> has made this point, &#34;There is no H5N1 <a href="/wiki/Pandemic" id="w">pandemic</a> so there can be no pandemic <a href="/wiki/Vaccine" id="w">vaccine</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-schultz_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-schultz" title="">[40]</a></sup> However, &#34;pre-pandemic vaccines&#34; have been created; are being refined and tested; and do have some promise both in furthering research and preparedness for the next pandemic.<sup id="_ref-Enserick_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Enserick" title="">[41]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Walker_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Walker" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-gao_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gao" title="">[43]</a></sup> Vaccine manufacturing companies are being encouraged to increase capacity so that if a pandemic vaccine is needed, facilities will be available for rapid production of large amounts of a vaccine specific to a new pandemic strain.</p>
<p>Animal and lab studies suggest that Relenza (<a href="/wiki/Zanamivir" id="w">zanamivir</a>), which is in the same class of drugs as Tamiflu, may also be effective against H5N1. In a study performed on mice in 2000, &#34;zanamivir was shown to be efficacious in treating avian influenza viruses H9N2, H6N1, and H5N1 transmissible to mammals&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Zanamvir_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zanamvir" title="">[44]</a></sup> While no one knows if zanamivir will be useful or not on a yet to exist pandemic strain of H5N1, it might be useful to stockpile zanamivir as well as oseltamivir in the event of an H5N1 influenza pandemic.

<p>People have reacted by buying less chicken causing poultry sales and prices to fall.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> Many individuals have stockpiled supplies for a possible flu pandemic. One of the best known experts on H5N1, Dr. <a href="/wiki/Robert_Webster" id="w">Robert Webster</a>, told ABC News he had a three month supply of food and water in his house as he prepared for what he considered a reasonably likely occurrence of a major pandemic.</p>

<p>However, Brown concedes that &#34;there are still huge gaps in our knowledge of the virus&#34; and there has been dearth of significant breakthroughs in research since 2003.
