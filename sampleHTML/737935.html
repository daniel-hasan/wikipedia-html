<a id="Plot_summary" name="Plot_summary"></a><h2>Plot summary</h2>

<p><i>Noble House</i> is set in <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Tai-pan" id="w">tai-pan</a>, Ian Dunross, struggles to rescue Struan&#39;s from the precarious financial position left over from his predecessor.  To do this, he seeks partnership with an American millionaire, while trying to ward off Quillan Gornt, who seeks to destroy Struan&#39;s once and for all.  Meanwhile, Chinese communists, Taiwanese nationalists, and Soviet spies illegally vie for influence in Hong Kong while the British government seeks to prevent this.  And nobody, it seems, can get anything done without enlisting the aid of Hong Kong&#39;s criminal underworld.</p>
<p>A major difference between the original novel and the later miniseries adaptation is the television version changes the setting from 1963 to the late 1980s, and updates visible technology accordingly.</p>
<p>Struan and Company is based on <a href="/wiki/Jardine_Matheson_Holdings" id="w">Jardine Matheson</a> which continues to exist to this day as an Asia based trading company. The chief character, Ian Dunross, is believed to have been a composite character of two Jardine tai-pans, Sir <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Barton" id="w">Hugh Barton</a> and Sir <a href="/wiki/Michael_Herries" id="w">Michael Herries</a>.</p>
