<p>The <i>tengu</i> in art appears in a large number of shapes, but it usually falls somewhere between a large, monstrous bird and a wholly <a href="/wiki/Anthropomorphism" id="w">anthropomorphized</a> being, often with a red face or an unusually large or long nose. Early depictions of <i>tengu</i> show them as <a href="/wiki/Kite_(bird)" id="w">kite</a>-like beings who can take a human-like form, often retaining avian wings, head or beak. The <i>tengu&#39;s</i> long nose seems to have been conceived sometime in the 14th century, likely as a humanization of the original bird&#39;s bill.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The <i>tengu&#39;s</i> long noses ally them with the <a href="/wiki/Shinto" id="w">Shinto</a> deity <a href="/wiki/Sarutahiko" id="w">Sarutahiko</a>, who is described in the Japanese historical text, the <i><a href="/wiki/Nihon_Shoki" id="w">Nihon Shoki</a></i>, with a similar proboscis measuring seven hand-spans in length.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  In village <a href="/wiki/Japanese_festivals" id="w">festivals</a> the two figures are often portrayed with identical red, phallic-nosed mask designs.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some of the earliest representations of <i>tengu</i> appear in Japanese picture scrolls, such as the {{nihongo}}, painted ca. 1296, which parodies high-ranking priests by endowing them the hawk-like beaks of <i>tengu</i> demons.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> <i>Tengu</i> are often pictured as taking the shape of some sort of priest. Beginning in the 13th century, <i>tengu</i> came to be associated in particular with the <i><a href="/wiki/Yamabushi" id="w">yamabushi</a></i>, the mountain ascetics who practice <a href="/wiki/Shugend%C5%8D" id="w">Shugendō</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The association soon found its way into Japanese art, where <i>tengu</i> are most frequently depicted in the <i>yamabushi&#39;s</i> distinctive costume, which includes a {{nihongo}} and a {{nihongo}}.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Tengu</i> are commonly depicted holding magical {{nihongo}}, fans made of feathers. In folk tales, these fans sometimes have the ability to grow or shrink a person&#39;s nose, but usually they are attributed the power to stir up great winds. Various other strange accessories may be associated with <i>tengu</i>, such as a type of tall, one-toothed <i><a href="/wiki/Geta_(footwear)" id="w">geta</a></i> sandal often called <i>tengu-geta</i>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>The term <i>tengu</i> and the characters used to write it are borrowed from the name of a fierce demon from Chinese folklore called <i><a href="/wiki/Tiangou" id="w">tiāngoǔ</a></i>. Chinese literature assigns this creature a variety of descriptions, but most often it is a fierce and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Anthropophagy">anthropophagous</a> canine monster that resembles a shooting star or comet. It makes a noise like thunder and brings war wherever it falls. One account from the <i>Shù Yì Jì</i> (述異記, &#34;A Collection of Bizarre Stories&#34;), written in 1791, describes a dog-like <i>tiāngoǔ</i> with a sharp beak and an upright posture, but usually <i>tiāngoǔ</i> bear little resemblance to their Japanese counterparts.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 23rd chapter of the <i><a href="/wiki/Nihon_Shoki" id="w">Nihon Shoki</a></i>, written in 720, is generally held to contain the first recorded mention of <i>tengu</i> in Japan. In this account a large shooting star appears and is identified by a Buddhist priest as a &#34;heavenly dog&#34;, and much like the <i>tiāngoǔ</i> of China, the star precedes a military uprising. Although the <a href="/wiki/Hanzi" id="w">Chinese characters</a> for <i>tengu</i> are used in the text, accompanying phonetic <a href="/wiki/Furigana" id="w">furigana</a> characters give the reading as <i>amatsukitsune</i> (<i>heavenly fox</i>). M.W. de Visser speculated that the early Japanese <i>tengu</i> may represent a conglomeration of two Chinese spirits: the <i>tiāngoǔ</i> and the fox spirits called <i><a href="/wiki/Huli_jing" id="w">huli jing</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>How the <i>tengu</i> was transformed from a dog-meteor into a bird-man is not clear. Some Japanese scholars have supported the theory that the <i>tengu&#39;s</i> image derives from that of the <a href="/wiki/Hindu" id="w">Hindu</a> eagle deity <a href="/wiki/Garuda" id="w">Garuda</a>, who was pluralized in Buddhist scripture as one of the major races of non-human beings. Like the <i>tengu</i>, the <i>garuda</i> are often portrayed in a human-like form with wings and a bird&#39;s beak. The name <i>tengu</i> seems to be written in place of that of the <i>garuda</i> in a Japanese <a href="/wiki/Sutra" id="w">sutra</a> called the <i>Enmyō Jizō Kyō</i> (延命地蔵経), but this was likely written in the <a href="/wiki/Edo_period" id="w">Edo period</a>, long after the <i>tengu&#39;s</i> image was established. At least one early story in the <i><a href="/wiki/Konjaku_Monogatari" id="w">Konjaku Monogatari</a></i> describes a <i>tengu</i> carrying off a dragon, which is reminiscent of the <i>garuda&#39;s</i> feud with the <i><a href="/wiki/N%C4%81ga" id="w">nāga</a></i> serpents. In other respects, however, the <i>tengu&#39;s</i> original behavior differs markedly from that of the <i>garuda</i>, which is generally friendly towards Buddhism. De Visser has speculated that the <i>tengu</i> may be descended from an ancient <a href="/wiki/Shinto" id="w">Shinto</a> bird-demon which was <a href="/wiki/Syncretism" id="w">syncretized</a> with both the <i>garuda</i> and the <i>tiāngoǔ</i> when Buddhism arrived in Japan. However, he found little evidence to support this idea.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>A later version of the <i><a href="/wiki/Kujiki" id="w">Kujiki</a></i>, an ancient Japanese historical text, writes the name of <a href="/wiki/Amanozako" id="w">Amanozako</a>, a monstrous female deity born from the god <a href="/wiki/Susanoo" id="w">Susanoo</a>&#39;s spat-out ferocity, with characters meaning <i>tengu deity</i> (天狗神). The book describes Amanozako as a raging creature capable of flight, with the body of a human, the head of a beast, a long nose, long ears, and long teeth that can chew through swords. An <a href="/wiki/18th_century" id="w">18th century</a> book called the {{nihongo}} suggests that this goddess may be the true predecessor of the <i>tengu</i>, but the date and authenticity of the <i>Kujiki</i>, and of that edition in particular, remain disputed.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Konjaku_Monogatari" id="w">Konjaku Monogatari</a></i>, a collection of stories published sometime during the late <a href="/wiki/Heian_Period" id="w">Heian Period</a>, contains some of the earliest tales of <i>tengu</i>, already characterized as they would be for centuries to come. These <i>tengu</i> are the troublesome opponents of Buddhism, who mislead the pious with false images of Buddha, carry off monks and drop them in remote places, possess women in an attempt to seduce holy men, rob temples, and endow those who worship them with unholy power. They often disguise themselves as priests or nuns, but their true form seems to be that of a kite.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Throughout the <a href="/wiki/12th_century" id="w">12th</a> and <a href="/wiki/13th_century" id="w">13th centuries</a>, accounts continued of <i>tengu</i> attempting to cause trouble in the world. They were now established as the ghosts of angry, vain, or heretical priests who had fallen on the &#34;<i>tengu</i>-road&#34; (天狗道, <i>tengudō</i>). They began to possess people, especially women and girls, and speak through their mouths  ( <i><a href="/wiki/Kitsune#Kitsunetsuki" id="w">kitsunetsuki</a></i>). Still the enemies of Buddhism, the demons also turned their attention to the royal family. The <a href="/wiki/Kojidan" id="w">Kojidan</a> tells of an Empress who was possessed, and the <a href="/wiki/Ōkagami" id="w">Ōkagami</a> reports that Emperor Sanjō was made blind by a <i>tengu</i>, the ghost of a priest who resented the throne. <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>One notorious <i>tengu</i> from the 12th century was himself the ghost of an emperor. The <i><a href="/wiki/Tale_of_H%C5%8Dgen" id="w">Hōgen Monogatari</a></i> tells the story of <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Sutoku" id="w">Emperor Sutoku</a>, who was forced by his father to abandon the throne.

According to legend he died in torment, having sworn to haunt the nation of Japan as a great demon, and thus became a fearsome <i>tengu</i> with long nails and eyes like a kite&#39;s. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In stories from the 13th century, <i>tengu</i> began to abduct young boys as well as the priests they had always targeted. The boys were often returned, while the priests would be found tied to the tops of trees or other high places. All of the <i>tengu&#39;s</i> victims, however, would come back in a state of near death or madness, sometimes after having been tricked into eating animal dung. <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>tengu</i> of this period were often conceived of as the ghosts of the arrogant, and as a result the creatures have became strongly associated with vanity and pride. Today the Japanese expression <i>tengu ni naru</i>, literally, &#34;he is turning into a <i>tengu</i>&#34;, is still used to describe a conceited person.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

He says that they fall onto the <i>tengu</i> road because, as Buddhists, they cannot go to <a href="/wiki/Di_Yu" id="w">Hell</a>, yet as people with bad principles, they also cannot go to <a href="/wiki/Nirvana" id="w">Heaven</a>. He describes the appearance of different types of <i>tengu</i>: the ghosts of priests, nuns, ordinary men, and ordinary women, all of whom in life possessed excessive pride.

<p><i>Daitengu</i> are often pictured in a more human-like form than their underlings, and due to their long noses, they may also called {{nihongo}}. <i>Kotengu</i> may conversely be depicted as more bird-like.

In the <a href="/wiki/1764" id="w">1764</a> collection of strange stories {{nihongo}}, a tale tells of a man who wanders into a deep valley while gathering leaves, only to be faced with a sudden and ferocious hailstorm. A group of peasants later tell him that he was in the valley where the <i>guhin</i> live, and anyone who takes a single leaf from that place will surely die. In the {{nihongo}}, written in <a href="/wiki/1849" id="w">1849</a>, the author describes the customs of the wood-cutters of <a href="/wiki/Mino_Province" id="w">Mino Province</a>, who used a sort of rice cake called <i>kuhin-<a href="/wiki/Mochi_(food)" id="w">mochi</a></i> to placate the <i>tengu</i>, who would otherwise perpetrate all sorts of mischief. In other provinces a special kind of fish called <i>okoze</i> was offered to the <i>tengu</i> by woodsmen and hunters, in exchange for a successful day&#39;s work.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> The people of <a href="/wiki/Ishikawa_Prefecture" id="w">Ishikawa Prefecture</a> have until recently believed that the <i>tengu</i> loathe <a href="/wiki/Mackerel" id="w">mackerel</a>, and have used this fish as a charm against kidnappings and hauntings by the mischievous spirits. <sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Tengu</i> are worshipped as beneficial <i><a href="/wiki/Kami" id="w">kami</a></i> (<i>gods</i> or <i>revered spirits</i>) in various Japanese religious cults. For example, the <i>tengu</i> Saburō of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Izuna" id="w">Izuna</a> is worshipped on that mountain and various others as {{nihongo}}, one of the primary deities in the <i>Izuna Shugen</i> cult, which also has ties to <a href="/wiki/Kitsune" id="w">fox</a> sorcery and the <a href="/wiki/Dakini" id="w">Dakini</a> of <a href="/wiki/Vajrayana" id="w">Tantric Buddhism</a>. Izuna Gongen is depicted as a beaked, winged figure with snakes wrapped around his limbs, surrounded by a halo of flame, riding on the back of a fox and brandishing a sword. Worshippers of <i>tengu</i> on other sacred mountains have adopted similar images for their deities, such as {{nihongo}} or {{nihongo}} of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Akiba" id="w">Akiba</a> and {{nihongo}} of Saijō-ji Temple in <a href="/wiki/Odawara%2C_Kanagawa" id="w">Odawara</a>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Tengu</i> appear frequently in the orally-transmitted tales collected by Japanese folklorists. As these stories are often humorous, they tend to portray <i>tengu</i> as ridiculous creatures who are easily tricked or confused by humans. Some common folk tales in which <i>tengu</i> appear include:</p>

<ul>
<li>{{nihongo}}: A boy looks through an ordinary piece of bamboo and pretends he can see distant places. A <i>tengu</i>, overwhelmed by curiosity, offers to trade it for a magic straw cloak that renders the wearer invisible. Having duped the <i>tengu</i>, the boy continues his mischief while wearing the cloak.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>{{nihongo}}: An old man has a lump or tumor on his face. In the mountains he encounters a band of <i>tengu</i> making merry and joins their dancing. He pleases them so much that they take the lump off his face, thinking that he will want it back and join them the next night. An unpleasant neighbor, who also has a lump, hears of the old man&#39;s good fortune and attempts to repeat it. The <i>tengu</i>, however, simply give him the first lump in addition to his own, either to keep their bargain, or because they are disgusted by his bad dancing.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>{{nihongo}} A scoundrel obtains a <i>tengu&#39;s</i> magic fan, which can shrink or grow noses. He secretly uses this item to grotesquely extend the nose of a rich man&#39;s daughter, and then shrinks it again in exchange for her hand in marriage. Later he accidentally fans himself while he dozes, and his nose grows so long it reaches heaven, resulting in painful misfortune for him.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>{{nihongo}}: A gambler meets a <i>tengu</i>, who asks him what he is most frightened of. The gambler lies, claiming that he is terrified of gold or <i><a href="/wiki/Mochi" id="w">mochi</a></i>. The <i>tengu</i> answers truthfully that he is frightened of a kind of plant or some other mundane item. The <i>tengu</i>, thinking he is playing a cruel trick, then causes money or rice cakes to rain down on the gambler. The gambler is of course delighted and proceeds to scare the <i>tengu</i> away with the thing he fears most. The gambler then obtains the <i>tengu&#39;s</i> magic gourd (or another treasured item) that was left behind.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>A <i>tengu</i> bothers a woodcutter, showing off his supernatural abilities by guessing everything the man is thinking. The woodcutter swings his axe, and a splinter of wood hits the <i>tengu</i> on the nose. The <i>tengu</i> flees in terror, exclaiming that humans are dangerous creatures who can do things without thinking about them.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></li></ul>

</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/14th_century" id="w">14th century</a>, the <i>tengu</i> began to trouble the world outside of the Buddhist clergy, and like their ominous ancestors the <i>tiāngoǔ</i>, the <i>tengu</i> became creatures associated with war.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> Legends eventually ascribed to them great knowledge in the art of skilled combat. </p>
<p>This reputation seems to have its origins in a legend surrounding the famous warrior <a href="/wiki/Minamoto_no_Yoshitsune" id="w">Minamoto no Yoshitsune</a>. When Yoshitsune was a young boy going by the name of Ushiwaka-maru, his father, <a href="/wiki/Minamoto_no_Yoshitomo" id="w">Yoshitomo</a>, was assassinated by the <a href="/wiki/Taira_clan" id="w">Taira clan</a>. <a href="/wiki/Taira_no_Kiyomori" id="w">Taira no Kiyomori</a>, head of the Taira, allowed the child to survive on the grounds that he be exiled to the temple on <a href="/wiki/Mount_Kurama" id="w">Mount Kurama</a> and become a monk. But one day in the Sōjō-ga-dani Valley, Ushiwaka encountered the mountain&#39;s <i>tengu</i>, <a href="/wiki/S%C5%8Dj%C5%8Db%C5%8D" id="w">Sōjōbō</a>. This spirit taught the boy the art of swordsmanship so that he might bring vengeance on the Taira.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Originally the actions of this <i>tengu</i> were portrayed as another attempt by demons to throw the world into chaos and war, but as Yoshitsune&#39;s renown as a legendary warrior increased, his monstrous teacher came to be depicted in a much more sympathetic and honorable light. In one of the most famous renditions of the story, the <a href="/wiki/Noh" id="w">Noh</a> play <i>Kurama Tengu</i>, Ushiwaka is the only person from his temple who does not give up an outing in disgust at the sight of a strange <i>yamabushi</i>. Sōjōbō thus befriends the boy and teaches him out of sympathy for his plight.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>Two stories from the <a href="/wiki/19th_century" id="w">19th century</a> continue this theme: In the <i>Sōzan Chomon Kishū</i>, a boy is carried off by a <i>tengu</i> and spends three years with the creature. He comes home with a magic gun that never misses a shot. A story from <a href="/wiki/Inaba_Province" id="w">Inaba Province</a>, related by <a href="/wiki/Inoue_Enry%C5%8D" id="w">Inoue Enryō</a>, tells of a girl with poor manual dexterity who is suddenly possessed by a <i>tengu</i>. The spirit wishes to rekindle the declining art of swordsmanship in the world. Soon a young samurai appears to whom the <i>tengu</i> has appeared in a dream, and the possessed girl instructs him as an expert swordsman.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Some rumors surrounding the <i><a href="/wiki/Ninja" id="w">ninja</a></i> indicate that they were also instructed by the <i>tengu</i>.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
