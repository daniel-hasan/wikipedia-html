<b>Interstate 35E</b> (I-35E) is an <a href="/wiki/Interstate_Highway" id="w">Interstate Highway</a> in the <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">U.S. state</a> of <a href="/wiki/Minnesota" id="w">Minnesota</a>, passing through downtown <a href="/wiki/Saint_Paul%2C_Minnesota" id="w">Saint Paul</a>. It is one of two through routes for <a href="/wiki/Interstate_35" id="w">Interstate 35</a> through the <a href="/wiki/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul" id="w">Twin Cities</a> of <a href="/wiki/Minneapolis%2C_MN" id="w">Minneapolis</a> and Saint Paul, the other being <a href="/wiki/Interstate_35W_(Minnesota)" id="w">Interstate 35W</a> through Minneapolis. Thus, both ends of I-35E are shared with I-35W and I-35. This is one of two pairs of <a href="/wiki/Suffixed_Interstates" id="w">suffixed Interstates</a> that has not been eliminated; I-35 also splits into <a href="/wiki/I-35E_(TX)" id="w">I-35E</a> and <a href="/wiki/I-35W_(TX)" id="w">I-35W</a> in <a href="/wiki/Dallas-Fort_Worth%2C_Texas" id="w">Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas</a>.</p>

In Minnesota, I-35E continues the <a href="/wiki/Exit_number" id="w">exit numbers</a> of I-35, while those of I-35W begin with 1 just north of the split. I-35E also carries the <a href="/wiki/Legislative_route_(Minnesota)" id="w">legislative route</a> of I-35 - Route 390 - through the Twin Cities. On the other hand, the portion of I-35E through the <a href="/wiki/West_End%2C_St._Paul" id="w">West End</a> of Saint Paul is a controversial four-lane <a href="/wiki/Parkway" id="w">parkway</a> that heavy trucks are prohibited from using.</p>

<p>The south end of I-35E is at exit 88A in <a href="/wiki/Burnsville%2C_MN" id="w">Burnsville</a>, where I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W. While I-35W heads north into Minneapolis, I-35E takes a northeasterly path into Saint Paul. There is no access between I-35E and I-35W here, but <a href="/wiki/County_Road_42_(Dakota_County%2C_Minnesota)" id="w">County Road 42</a> (exit 88B), immediately to the north, connects the two Interstates. Major interchanges south of Saint Paul include <a href="/wiki/Highway_77_(Minnesota)" id="w">Highway 77</a> (exit 92) and <a href="/wiki/Interstate_494_(Minnesota)" id="w">Interstate 494</a> (exit 99). Between exits 94 and 97, the highway deviates from its relatively straight path to avoid <a href="/wiki/Blackhawk_Lake" id="w">Blackhawk Lake</a>. As it crosses I-494, it turns more to the north, crossing <a href="/wiki/Highway_110_(Minnesota)" id="w">Highway 110</a> (exit 101) and <a href="/wiki/Highway_13_(Minnesota)" id="w">Highway 13</a> (exit 102) in <a href="/wiki/Mendota_Heights%2C_MN" id="w">Mendota Heights</a> before crossing the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Lexington_Bridge_(Mississippi_River)" id="w">Lexington Bridge</a> into Saint Paul. This portion is four lanes wide (two in each direction), except between Highway 77 and Highway 110, where it carries six lanes. The Lexington Bridge carries six lanes - four through lanes and the exit and entrance lanes for Highway 13 - as well as a <a href="/wiki/Bicycle_and_pedestrian_path" id="w">bicycle and pedestrian path</a>.<sup id="_ref-Google_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Google" title="">[1]</a></sup> The bridge has an innovative automatic <a href="/wiki/Anti-icing" id="w">anti-icing</a> system that sprays <a href="/wiki/Potassium_acetate" id="w">potassium acetate</a> onto the bridge surface to prevent frost and ice formation in inclement weather. </p>

The auxiliary lanes from Highway 13 leave at the first exit in Saint Paul, a half interchange with <a href="/wiki/Shepard_Road" id="w">Shepard Road</a> (exit 103A) with ramps toward the bridge. Shepard Road is a four-lane road with minimal intersections that follows the Mississippi River northeast into <a href="/wiki/Downtown_Saint_Paul" id="w">downtown Saint Paul</a>. Immediately after Shepard Road is <a href="/wiki/Highway_5_(Minnesota)" id="w">Highway 5</a> (West 7th Street) (exit 103B), which leads northeast to downtown through the heart of the <a href="/wiki/West_End%2C_St._Paul" id="w">West End</a>. The portion of I-35E between Highway 5 and downtown is a mostly sunken four-lane <a href="/wiki/Parkway" id="w">parkway</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Speed_limit" id="w">speed limit</a> of 45 miles per hour (70 km/h), a ban on trucks over 9000 lbs (4000 kg) <a href="/wiki/Gross_vehicle_weight" id="w">gross vehicle weight</a>, and median landscaping. This parkway was built instead of a typical six-lane freeway because of local opposition. Major interchanges on this section include <a href="/wiki/Ayd_Mill_Road" id="w">Ayd Mill Road</a> (exit 104B), a sunken four-lane road to the northwest, and <a href="/wiki/Kellogg_Boulevard" id="w">Kellogg Boulevard</a> (exit 106B), which extends in both directions as part of a loop around downtown.<sup id="_ref-Google_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Google" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The four lanes of I-35E pass through downtown in the center of the six lanes of I-94, with a short <a href="/wiki/Commons_(road)" id="w">commons</a> occupying the blocks between 11th and 12th Streets. Despite this short overlap, there is no weaving between the two highways, since an exit in each direction of I-35E - exit 107A from I-35E north to I-94 east, and exit 107B from I-35E south to I-94 west - takes traffic that would move to the right in the commons instead to the right of the entire roadway. There are no interchanges on the commons, and no direct access from I-35E northbound to I-94 west or I-94 eastbound to I-35E south. Kellogg Boulevard provides an indirect connection; Ayd Mill Road, further west, nears I-94 but does not connect without several turns and traffic lights. Unlike the west split of I-35E and I-94, all ramps are present at the east split; among other uses, the I-35E southbound to I-94 east and I-94 westbound to I-35E north ramps carry traffic following <a href="/wiki/U.S._Highway_10_(Minnesota)" id="w">U.S. Highway 10</a>, which overlaps I-35E north of downtown, and truck traffic using the <a href="/wiki/Lafayette_Freeway" id="w">Lafayette Freeway</a> (<a href="/wiki/U.S._Highway_52_(Minnesota)" id="w">U.S. Highway 52</a>) to avoid the parkway through the West End.<sup id="_ref-Google_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Google" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>From downtown Saint Paul north to the junction with <a href="/wiki/Interstate_694_(Minnesota)" id="w">Interstate 694</a> west (exit 113), where US 10 also leaves I-35E, the highway carries three lanes of traffic in each direction. Major interchanges here include Pennsylvania Avenue (exit 108), another part of the loop that includes Kellogg Boulevard, and <a href="/wiki/Highway_36_(Minnesota)" id="w">Highway 36</a> (exit 111). A commons of about one mile (1.5 km) exists between the two interchanges with I-694 (exits 113 and 115); unlike the one with I-94, traffic must weave to remain on either road. Heading northbound on I-35E, the three lanes split into two for I-694 westbound and two for I-35E northbound, and then one lane from I-694 eastbound enters on the left. These three lanes then split into two on the right for I-694 eastbound and two on the left for I-35E northbound; after the turn north, a lane joins on the right from I-694 westbound traffic. Thus through traffic on I-694 eastbound must move right at least one lane, and only the center lane of I-35E north continues through. The configuration in the other direction, where I-35E southbound and I-694 westbound merge, is similar, but two lanes of I-694 westbound enter the merge, and the rightmost of the two I-35E lanes ends, so all I-35E south traffic must move at least one lane to the left, while the right lane of I-694 west can continue straight through.<sup id="_ref-Google_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Google" title="">[1]</a></sup> A <a href="/wiki/Road_construction" id="w">construction</a> project, called &#34;Unweave the Weave&#34;, is in progress to eliminate this weaving in a similar method to the I-94 commons, with three I-35E lanes inside three I-694 lanes, and separate right-side ramps from I-35E to I-694.<sup id="_ref-unweave_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-unweave" title="">[2]</a></sup> Completion is planned for late 2008.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>I-35E is four lanes wide north of I-694; the third lane added northbound from the I-694 westbound ramp exits immediately onto County Road E (exit 115). Other than the north end of I-35E (exit 127) in <a href="/wiki/Columbus%2C_MN" id="w">Columbus</a>, where it merges with I-35W to re-form I-35, there are only four interchanges north of I-694, all for county roads, though one - <a href="/wiki/County_Road_96_(Ramsey_County%2C_Minnesota)" id="w">County Road 96</a> - was formerly part of <a href="/wiki/Trunk_Highway_96_(Minnesota)" id="w">Trunk Highway 96</a>.<sup id="_ref-Google_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Google" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">1955 plan for I-35E and other Twin Cities Interstates</div>
Early plans for the <a href="/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System" id="w">Interstate Highway System</a> include a route along roughly the same alignment as the present I-35 through the Twin Cities area, but are not detailed enough to show exactly how the cities would be served.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> When preliminary urban routes were laid out in 1955, a split alignment was chosen to serve both cities equally. South of the Twin Cities, I-35 followed the corridor of <a href="/wiki/U.S._Highway_65_(Minnesota)" id="w">U.S. Highway 65</a>, which passed through Minneapolis. I-35E was located parallel to <a href="/wiki/Highway_13_(Minnesota)" id="w">Highway 13</a>, which cut northeast to Saint Paul from US 65 south of the <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_River" id="w">Minnesota River</a>. North of the metropolitan area, I-35 followed <a href="/wiki/U.S._Highway_61_(Minnesota)" id="w">U.S. Highway 61</a>, which passed through Saint Paul; I-35W paralleled <a href="/wiki/U.S._Highway_8_(Minnesota)" id="w">U.S. Highway 8</a> from Minneapolis northeast to the merge with I-35E south of <a href="/wiki/Forest_Lake%2C_MN" id="w">Forest Lake</a>, near where US 8 joined US 61.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_Legislature" id="w">Minnesota Legislature</a> defined I-35E as part of <a href="/wiki/Legislative_Route_390_(Minnesota)" id="w">Legislative Route 390</a>, which stretched south to <a href="/wiki/Iowa" id="w">Iowa</a> and north to <a href="/wiki/Duluth%2C_MN" id="w">Duluth</a> along I-35.</p>
<p>I-35E was completed north of downtown Saint Paul in 1970. The first section of to open ran north from Maryland Avenue to <a href="/wiki/I-694_(MN)" id="w">I-694</a>; this was completed in the early 1960s, concurrently with I-694 west to <a href="/wiki/TH_49_(MN)" id="w">TH 49</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Later that decade, it was extended south to downtown, opening first to Pennsylvania Avenue and then to <a href="/wiki/I-94_(MN)" id="w">I-94</a>, including the I-94 <a href="/wiki/Overlap_(road)" id="w">overlap</a> (and I-94 in both directions<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>). In 1970,<sup id="_ref-politics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-politics" title="">[9]</a></sup> I-35E was extended north along the I-694 overlap and to its north end; the adjacent sections of <a href="/wiki/I-35_(MN)" id="w">I-35</a>, <a href="/wiki/I-35W_(MN)" id="w">I-35W</a>, and I-694 opened at about the same time.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-control_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-control" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The southern half of I-35E took a lot longer to build.

<div class="thumbcaption">The St. Peter Street bridge over the I-94 overlap</div>
The missing piece through the <a href="/wiki/West_End%2C_St._Paul" id="w">West End</a> of Saint Paul, from Highway 5 northeast to I-94 in downtown, was held up by controversy. Construction began in 1964, and was planned for completion in the 1970s as a typical six-lane freeway, but the <a href="/wiki/National_Environmental_Policy_Act" id="w">National Environmental Policy Act</a> was passed on <a href="/wiki/January_1" id="w">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a>. In late 1969, a group of neighbors in the area had formed <b>Residents in Protest 35E</b> (RIP 35E) to oppose the completion of I-35E. The group convinced the city to drop its support, and in August it filed a joint <a href="/wiki/Lawsuit" id="w">lawsuit</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_Highway_Department" id="w">Minnesota Highway Department</a> (MHD) and <a href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Transportation" id="w">U.S. Department of Transportation</a> along with four neighborhood associations and eight citizens. The parties quickly reached an agreement, favorable to the plaintiffs, to halt construction pending an <a href="/wiki/Environmental_impact_statement" id="w">environmental impact statement</a> (EIS).<sup id="_ref-politics_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-politics" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Saint Paul City Council decided in late 1974 to support I-35E, possibly due to the influence of proponents. RIP 35E proposed an alternative to the original plan, and convinced the city council to go along with it. The plan included a four-lane <a href="/wiki/Boulevard" id="w">boulevard</a> upgrade of Pleasant Avenue (the street chosen for the I-35E alignment), with another route such as <a href="/wiki/Shepard_Road" id="w">Shepard Road</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Lafayette_Freeway" id="w">Lafayette Freeway</a> forming part of I-35E. The group opposed any direct connection of this parkway to I-94 near the <a href="/wiki/State_Capitol%2C_Minnesota" id="w">State Capitol</a>, where I-35E and I-94 were to merge. The EIS was completed in early 1975, identifying <a href="/wiki/Noise_pollution" id="w">noise pollution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" id="w">air pollution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vibration" id="w">vibrations</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Slope_stability" id="w">slope stability</a> as the main concerns. In addition to the nearby location of historic districts, hospitals were worried about the effects of vibrations on sensitive operations; the MHD solved this problem while the report was being developed. The EIS identified the primary benefit of completing I-35E as connecting downtown Saint Paul to the Interstate Highway System, and determined that the original Pleasant Avenue corridor was the best choice, but with minor changes such as lowering the freeway below Grand Avenue and Ramsey Street.<sup id="_ref-politics_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-politics" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>A bill passed by the <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_Legislature" id="w">Minnesota Legislature</a> on <a href="/wiki/May_31" id="w">May 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a> imposed a  moratorium on building I-35E, as well as other area freeways such as <a href="/wiki/Interstate_335_(Minnesota)" id="w">Interstate 335</a> and <a href="/wiki/Highway_55_(Minnesota)" id="w">Highway 55</a> (<a href="/wiki/Hiawatha_Avenue" id="w">Hiawatha Avenue</a>). This law defined several new <a href="/wiki/Legislative_route_(Minnesota)" id="w">legislative routes</a>, which &#34;may be added by order of the commissioner of transportation to the trunk highway system&#34; (as opposed to other such routes, which were added to that system by the legislature):
</p><blockquote>Route No. 380. Beginning at a point on Route No. 390 [I-35E] at its intersection with Shepard Road in the city of Saint Paul; thence extending in a northeasterly direction generally following along the course of Shepard Road to a point on Route No. 112 [Lafayette Freeway]; thence extending in a northeasterly direction to a point on Route No. 392 [I-94] easterly of the downtown area of Saint Paul; providing a connector route between Route No. 390 and Routes No. 112 and 392;</blockquote>
<p /><blockquote>Route No. 381. Beginning at a point on Route No. 112 [Lafayette Freeway], northerly of the Lafayette Street bridge in the city of Saint Paul; thence extending in a northwesterly direction to a point on Route No. 390 [I-35E], southerly of Maryland Avenue in the city of Saint Paul; providing a connector route between Route No. 112 and Route No. 390; and</blockquote>
<p /><blockquote>Route No. 382. Beginning at a point on Route No. 390 [I-35E] at its junction with Route No. 111 [Highway 5], thence extending in a general northerly direction, within the corridor of the right of way already acquired on the effective date of this act, for Route No. 390, to a point on Short Line Road; thence extending in a northeasterly direction within said corridor of right of way to the intersection of Pleasant Avenue and Kellogg Boulevard in the city of Saint Paul.</blockquote>
<p>Routes 380 and 381 provided for an alternate alignment of I-35E along Shepard Road and a northerly extension of the Lafayette Freeway, while Route 382 was a &#34;four lane <a href="/wiki/Parkway" id="w">parkway</a> facility&#34; that the MHD could build along the original alignment of I-35E, but without a connection to I-94. The city announced its support of the parkway in August 1976.<sup id="_ref-politics_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-politics" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>An act passed on <a href="/wiki/April_5" id="w">April 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1978" id="w">1978</a> added a condition to the definition of Route 390 (I-35E):
</p><blockquote>Route No. 390 [I-35E] shall not include any portion of Route No. 382 [the parkway] as designated by section 161.117 or any portion of any route connecting Route No. 382 to Route No. 392 [I-94], nor shall it include any portion of <a href="/wiki/Trunk_Highway_3_(Minnesota)" id="w">trunk highway marked No. 3</a> from <a href="/wiki/Trunk_Highway_110_(Minnesota)" id="w">trunk highway marked No. 110</a> in Dakota county to East Seventh Street in the city of Saint Paul.</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that, at the time, Highway 3 was marked along the Lafayette Freeway.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>It also allowed a connection from the parkway to I-94, but this link could not be <a href="/wiki/Controlled_access" id="w">controlled access</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Council" id="w">Metropolitan Council</a> was to complete a draft EIS for the parkway and I-35E by <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1979" id="w">1979</a>, with the cooperation of Mn/DOT and Saint Paul. There was widespread support for a 45 mile-per-hour parkway, with landscaping and a truck restriction, but the non-connection to I-94 jeopardized federal Interstate funding, since it could no longer be part of the continuous I-35E. Two notable alternatives came out of the draft EIS - a parkway with or without an I-94 connection. The parkway with a connection would provide the same <a href="/wiki/Level_of_service" id="w">level of service</a> as a typical freeway.<sup id="_ref-politics_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-politics" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>RIP 35E and other citizens&#39; groups continued to oppose a direct connection, arguing that it would be no different from a typical freeway, since drivers would be more likely to exceed the speed limit if it was a continuous roadway to I-94. Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981, supporting a direct connection, along with Mn/DOT and the Metropolitan Council. A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I-94, and allowed Route 390 (I-35E) to use Route 382 (the parkway). The final EIS was approved at about that time, and several groups including RIP 35E filed suit in early 1983.<sup id="_ref-politics_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-politics" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The suit alleged that the EIS focused almost exclusively on the Pleasant Avenue alignment, and that it did not consider the effect of a direct connection on speed limit compliance; faster traffic would mean more noise. Judge <a href="/wiki/Paul_Magnuson" id="w">Paul Magnuson</a> ruled in February 1984 that the EIS was valid, stating that the Pleasant Avenue alternative was the only reasonable one that would meet goals. This court order has been interpreted as a legal contract, prohibiting the state from raising the speed limit or allowing trucks.<sup id="_ref-politics_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-politics" title="">[9]</a></sup> Construction went forward, and I-35E was opened from Highway 5 north to Saint Clair Avenue in 1984, using original bridges that had been built for three lanes in each direction. Further extensions, including all new bridges,<sup id="_ref-control_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-control" title="">[11]</a></sup> were opened to Grand Avenue in 1986, to Kellogg Boulevard in November 1988,<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> and to I-94 on <a href="/wiki/October_15" id="w">October 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a>, 26 years after construction began.

<p>The original plans for the I-94 commons in downtown Saint Paul did not include the right-side ramps that eliminate weaving.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The ramp from I-35E northbound to I-94 eastbound was added when I-35E was finally completed in 1990, and a five-year construction project that was completed in 1992 added the ramp from I-35E southbound to I-94 westbound, as well as a direct ramp from I-35E southbound to the Lafayette Freeway to avoid weaving across I-94 east.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> This project was done because the old &#34;Spaghetti Junction&#34; at the east split of I-35E and I-94 would not be able to handle the extra load from the completed I-35E parkway.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>When the first piece of the parkway opened in 1984, unused provisions, pending more study, were added for a direct link to <a href="/wiki/Ayd_Mill_Road" id="w">Ayd Mill Road</a>, a sunken four-lane road with minimal intersections that leads northwest from I-35E. The ramps were built and temporarily opened in 1992 for <a href="/wiki/High-occupancy_vehicle" id="w">high-occupancy vehicles</a>, due to the closure of the <a href="/wiki/Lafayette_Bridge" id="w">Lafayette Bridge</a> for reconstruction.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> The ramps were reopened on <a href="/wiki/June_12" id="w">June 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a> as a test,<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> and remain open <a href="/wiki/As_of_2007" id="w">as of 2007</a>. A controversial extension of Ayd Mill Road to I-94 remains on the table.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 1964 <a href="/wiki/Lexington_Bridge_(Mississippi_River)" id="w">Lexington Bridge</a> across the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a> was replaced by a new bridge, built from 2001 to 2004,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> due to deterioration of the old structure including cracks in steel beams.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Unweave the Weave, a project to eliminate weaving at the <a href="/wiki/I-694_(MN)" id="w">I-694</a> <a href="/wiki/Commons_(road)" id="w">commons</a>, is ongoing <a href="/wiki/As_of_2007" id="w">as of 2007</a>.<sup id="_ref-unweave_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-unweave" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 1965 bridge just north of downtown Saint Paul carrying a daily traffic volume of 148,000 vehicles over Cayuga Street and the <a href="/wiki/BNSF_Railway" id="w">BNSF Railway</a> line was rated by <a href="/wiki/Mn/DOT" id="w">Mn/DOT</a> as meeting minimum tolerable limits in 2006.  Its superstructure and substructure were described as poor with advanced section loss, deterioration, spalling, or scour.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> As the fourth busiest bridge in the state,<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> it was scrutinized following the collapse of the <a href="/wiki/I-35W_Mississippi_River_Bridge" id="w">I-35W Mississippi River Bridge</a> in 2007.</p>
