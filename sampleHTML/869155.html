<p><b><i>Quatermass II</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television" id="w">science-fiction</a> <a href="/wiki/Serial_(radio_and_television)" id="w">serial</a>, originally broadcast by <a href="/wiki/BBC_One" id="w">BBC Television</a> in the autumn of 1955.

It is also the earliest surviving complete British science-fiction television production.</p>
<p>The serial sees <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Quatermass" id="w">Professor Bernard Quatermass</a> of the British Experimental Rocket Group being asked to examine strange <a href="/wiki/Meteorite" id="w">meteorite</a> showers. His investigations lead to his uncovering a <a href="/wiki/Conspiracy_(political)" id="w">conspiracy</a> involving <a href="/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" id="w">alien</a> infiltration at the highest levels of the <a href="/wiki/Her_Majesty%26%2339%3Bs_Government" id="w">British Government</a>. As even some of Quatermass&#39;s closest colleagues fall victim to the alien influence, he is forced to use his own unsafe rocket prototype, which recently caused a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents" id="w">nuclear disaster</a> at an <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australian</a> testing range, to prevent the aliens from taking over <a href="/wiki/Mankind" id="w">mankind</a>.</p>

Strange objects are falling from the sky, one shower of which is observed by a military <a href="/wiki/Radar" id="w">radar</a> unit. After a farmer finds one of the objects in a country field, the soldiers become directly involved, and Captain John Dillon decides to unofficially ask the father of his fiancÃ©, Paula, to investigate. Paula&#39;s father is Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group &#8212; &#34;the rocket man!&#34;, as one of Dillon&#39;s troops puts it.</p>
<p>Following the events of <i>The Quatermass Experiment</i>, Quatermass is now working on a powerful new rocket named the &#34;Quatermass II&#34;. He is also planning a project to establish <a href="/wiki/Colonization_of_the_Moon" id="w">permanent bases on the moon</a>. However, as the serial begins Quatermass is recovering from the news that an accident at the Quatermass II project&#39;s Australian testing range has caused a devastating <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_explosion" id="w">nuclear explosion</a>.</p>
<p>Quatermass agrees to accompany Dillon on an investigation and the pair end up at the strange factory being built at Winnerden Flats, which seems to be the centre of the meteorite falls. There he finds a huge synthetic food plant which he is shocked to realise is an exact replica of one of his proposed moon bases. When Dillon becomes infected by &#34;the mark&#34; after going too close to a fallen meteorite, he begins opposing Quatermass, who finds that the factory is actually housing a growing alien creature rather than producing food.</p>
<p>As he tries to investigate further, Quatermass finds that figures in the highest levels of power in Britain have been &#34;marked&#34;, and are under alien control. With little time left to prevent a catastrophe, he and his assistant Dr Leo Pugh are forced to use Quatermass&#39;s experimental rocket and attempt to fight the alien menace in space, despite the known flaws in the rocket&#39;s design. When the rocket reaches the aliens&#39; asteroid base, Quatermass finds that Pugh has also been taken over by their influence; however, his colleague is sent floating helplessly off into space by the <a href="/wiki/Recoil" id="w">recoil</a> from a gun he uses attempting to shoot Quatermass. The Professor is able to destroy the asteroid and take off safely back to Earth in his rocket.</p>

<p>The BBC&#39;s own website regarded <i>Quatermass II</i> unfavourably when reviewing its <a href="/wiki/DVD" id="w">DVD</a> release in 2005. &#34;The script is too often let down by the production&#39;s rougher edges.

<p>Speaking in a 2003 <a href="/wiki/Television_documentary" id="w">television documentary</a> about Nigel Kneale&#39;s career, the writer and critic <a href="/wiki/Kim_Newman" id="w">Kim Newman</a> praised the underlying themes of <i>Quatermass II</i>, and their particular relevance to the British way of life. &#34;<i>Quatermass II</i> is the British <i>Invasion of the Bodysnatchers</i>, but I don&#39;t necessarily think that&#39;s a bad thing... What <i>Quatermass II</i> does is take that metaphor and apply it to the specific conditions of Britain in the 1950s; not just the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" id="w">Cold War</a> paranoia, but the traditional British grumbling resentment of bureaucracy as represented by <a href="/wiki/Local_government_in_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">the council</a>, or in this case big business.&#34;<sup id="_ref-tapes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tapes" title="">[37]</a></sup> The British Film Institute&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/Screenonline" id="w">Screenonline</a>&#34; website also offers praise in its analysis of the serial.</p><blockquote>&#34;With its tale of an invasion by an invisible enemy indistinguishable from ourselves, Kneale&#39;s story tapped into contemporary fears about the &#39;red&#39; (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Communist" id="w">communist</a>) threat, although in a less direct way than the American science fiction films of the 1950s, including <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>. At the same time, it reflected the widespread anxiety of the nuclear age &#8212; the story begins with a failed test of a nuclear-powered rocket in Australia (at a time when the country was in reality a site for a series of British <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapons" id="w">nuclear weapons</a> tests). In short, <i>Quatermass II</i> was the perfect cold-war drama.&#34;<sup id="_ref-screenonline_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-screenonline" title="">[4]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Some <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction_fandom" id="w">science-fiction fans</a> have speculated that the Quatermass serials in general, and <i>Quatermass II</i> in particular &#8212; with its elements including a conspiracy of silence in the government concerning extraterrestrial life, secret government facilities for alien use, and the silencing of any critic who opposes the government&#39;s plans &#8212; influenced the successful <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> series <i><a href="/wiki/The_X-Files" id="w">The X-Files</a></i> (1993&#8211;2002).<sup id="_ref-11th hour_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11th hour" title="">[38]</a></sup> Kneale was invited to write for <i>The X-Files</i> during the 1990s, but declined the offer.<sup id="_ref-timesobit_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timesobit" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other genre productions that have been compared with the serial include the 1970 <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who" id="w">Doctor Who</a></i> story <i><a href="/wiki/Spearhead_from_Space" id="w">Spearhead from Space</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-screenonline_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-screenonline" title="">[4]</a></sup> This serial features an alien entity falling to Earth in a meteorite shower; a factory taken over for the growth of the alien creature, and governmental institutions being inflitrated by servants of the aliens.<sup id="_ref-spearhead_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spearhead" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>

<p>As with <i>The Quatermass Experiment</i>, the film rights to the serial were purchased by <a href="/wiki/Hammer_Film_Productions" id="w">Hammer Film Productions</a> &#8212; in this case after they had only read the scripts, before the serial was even made.<sup id="_ref-dvdnotes18_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvdnotes18" title="">[19]</a></sup> Titled <i><a href="/wiki/Quatermass_2" id="w">Quatermass 2</a></i>, the film was released in 1957 and once again directed by <a href="/wiki/Val_Guest" id="w">Val Guest</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Brian_Donlevy" id="w">Brian Donlevy</a> starring; unlike the first film, Kneale wrote the <a href="/wiki/Screenplay" id="w">screenplay</a> himself.<sup id="_ref-quat2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-quat2" title="">[41]</a></sup> In the United States, the film was released under the title <i>Enemy From Space</i>.<sup id="_ref-quat2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-quat2" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shortly after <i>Quatermass II</i> finished its run, comedian <a href="/wiki/Bob_Monkhouse" id="w">Bob Monkhouse</a> included a spoof of the serial in an episode of his own BBC television series, which featured Monica Grey reprising her role as Paula Quatermass. Cartier and Kneale were greatly displeased with this, and complained to their superiors at the BBC about it.<sup id="_ref-murray52_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-murray52" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>Quatermass returned to the BBC in 1958 when Kneale&#39;s third serial, <i><a href="/wiki/Quatermass_and_the_Pit" id="w">Quatermass and the Pit</a></i>, began transmission.<sup id="_ref-screen_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-screen" title="">[43]</a></sup> That was the last television appearance of the character for twenty years, until Kneale brought Quatermass back for a final time in the 1979 serial <i><a href="/wiki/Quatermass_(TV_serial)" id="w">Quatermass</a></i>, this time produced for <a href="/wiki/Thames_Television" id="w">Thames Television</a>.<sup id="_ref-q79_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-q79" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>A serialised <a href="/wiki/Novelisation" id="w">novelisation</a> of <i>Quatermass II</i>, written by Kneale, ran in the <i>Daily Express</i> newspaper in the UK from <a href="/wiki/December_5" id="w">December 5</a> to <a href="/wiki/December_20" id="w">December 20</a> <a href="/wiki/1955" id="w">1955</a>, although Kneale was forced to draw the storyline to a premature conclusion as the paper lost interest in the project.<sup id="_ref-dvdnotes26_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvdnotes26" title="">[45]</a></sup> The television scripts were released by <a href="/wiki/Penguin_Books" id="w">Penguin Books</a> in 1960, with a selection of stills from the production also included.<sup id="_ref-dvdnotes38_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvdnotes38" title="">[46]</a></sup> The book was re-released in 1979, with a new introduction by Kneale, to coincide with the transmission of the Thames Television serial.<sup id="_ref-dvdnotes39_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvdnotes39" title="">[47]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In April 2005 <a href="/wiki/BBC_Worldwide" id="w">BBC Worldwide</a> released a DVD <a href="/wiki/Box_set" id="w">box set</a> of all their existing <i>Quatermass</i> material.<sup id="_ref-bbcdvd_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbcdvd" title="">[1]</a></sup> This included <a href="/wiki/Remaster" id="w">digitally restored</a> versions of all six episodes of <i>Quatermass II</i>,<sup id="_ref-restoration_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-restoration" title="">[16]</a></sup> with the sound and vision of the telerecording copies cleaned up as far as possible, and some of the existing <a href="/wiki/Special_effect" id="w">special effects</a> inserts that survived on their original film elements being re-inserted into the episodes.<sup id="_ref-restoration_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-restoration" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
