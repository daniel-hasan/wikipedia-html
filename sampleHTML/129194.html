<p><b>Brian Samuel Epstein</b> ({{IPAEng}}) (born in <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" id="w">Liverpool</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>; <a href="/wiki/19_September" id="w">19 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1934" id="w">1934</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/27_August" id="w">27 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1967" id="w">1967</a>) was the manager of <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles" id="w">The Beatles</a>. He also managed several other musical artists such as <a href="/wiki/Gerry_%26amp%3B_The_Pacemakers" id="w">Gerry &#38; The Pacemakers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Billy_J._Kramer" id="w">Billy J. Kramer</a> and the Dakotas, and <a href="/wiki/Cilla_Black" id="w">Cilla Black</a>. </p>
<p>The Beatles recorded a demo in <a href="/wiki/Decca_Records" id="w">Decca</a>&#39;s studios—paid for by Epstein—which he later persuaded <a href="/wiki/George_Martin" id="w">George Martin</a> to listen to. Epstein was then offered a contract (after Martin had auditioned the group) by <a href="/wiki/EMI" id="w">EMI</a>&#39;s small <a href="/wiki/Parlophone" id="w">Parlophone</a> label, even though they had previously been rejected by almost every other British record company.</p>
<p>Epstein died of an accidental drug overdose at his home in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> in August 1967. The Beatles&#39; early success has been attributed to Epstein&#39;s management and sense of style. <a href="/wiki/Paul_McCartney" id="w">Paul McCartney</a> said of Epstein: &#34;If anyone was the <a href="/wiki/Fifth_Beatle" id="w">Fifth Beatle</a>, it was Brian.&#34;</p>

Epstein was born into a <a href="/wiki/Jewish" id="w">Jewish</a> family in Rodney Street, Liverpool, England. His grandfather (Isaac Epstein) was from Hodan, <a href="/wiki/Lithuania" id="w">Lithuania</a>; he arrived in England with his wife Diana in the 1890s at the age of eighteen. He founded a <a href="/wiki/Furniture" id="w">furniture</a> dealership on Walton Road, Liverpool. Diana and Isaac&#39;s third son was Harry Epstein; the father of Brian Epstein.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp255_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp255" title="">[1]</a></sup> After Harry and his brothers had joined the family firm, Isaac Epstein founded &#34;I. Epstein and Sons&#34;, and expanded his furniture business by taking over an adjacent shop to sell a varied range of other goods, such as musical instruments and <a href="/wiki/Household_appliances" id="w">household appliances</a>.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp255_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp255" title="">[1]</a></sup> They called the new shop &#34;NEMS&#34; (North End Music Stores) from which McCartney&#39;s father once bought a piano.<sup id="_ref-SpitzPage71_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SpitzPage71" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-MilesPage23-24_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MilesPage23-24" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Epstein&#39;s mother was formally named Malka (although always known by her family as Queenie—Malka translating as &#34;queen&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Hebrew" id="w">Hebrew</a>) and was a member of the successful Hyman furniture family. Harry and Queenie also had another son, Clive. During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">WWII</a> the Epsteins moved to <a href="/wiki/Southport" id="w">Southport</a> to escape <a href="/wiki/The_Blitz" id="w">The Blitz</a>—where two schools expelled Epstein for laziness and poor performance—but returned to Liverpool in 1945.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp257_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp257" title="">[4]</a></sup> The Epsteins lived at 127 Queens Drive, <a href="/wiki/Childwall" id="w">Childwall</a>, in Liverpool, and stayed there for 30 years.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> 
After his parents had moved him from one <a href="/wiki/Boarding_school" id="w">boarding school</a> to another, the 14-year-old Epstein spent two years at <a href="/wiki/Wrekin_College" id="w">Wrekin College</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Shropshire" id="w">Shropshire</a>. Shortly before his sixteenth birthday in 1950, he sent a long letter to his father, explaining that he wanted to become a <a href="/wiki/Fashion_design" id="w">dress designer</a>, but Harry Epstein was adamantly opposed to this idea, and his son finally had to &#34;report for duty&#34; at the family&#39;s furniture shop.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp258-259_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp258-259" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In December 1951, Epstein was <a href="/wiki/Conscription" id="w">drafted</a>—as a <a href="/wiki/Data_entry_clerk" id="w">clerk</a>—into the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Army_Service_Corps" id="w">Royal Army Service Corps</a>, and was posted to the <a href="/wiki/Albany_Street_Barracks" id="w">Albany Street Barracks</a> near <a href="/wiki/Regent%26%2339%3Bs_Park" id="w">Regent&#39;s Park</a>, in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, where he was often reprimanded for not picking up his army <a href="/wiki/Salary" id="w">pay</a>.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp259_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp259" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1955, at the age of twenty-one, Epstein was made a director of NEMS. In September of 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend, but after being there for only one day, he was robbed of his <a href="/wiki/Passport" id="w">passport</a>, <a href="/wiki/Birth_certificate" id="w">birth certificate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cheque" id="w">chequebook</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wristwatch" id="w">wristwatch</a>, and all the money he had on him. As he did not want his parents to find out, he worked as <a href="/wiki/Department_store" id="w">department store</a> <a href="/wiki/Clerk" id="w">clerk</a> until he had earned enough money to buy a train ticket back to Liverpool.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp261_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp261" title="">[8]</a></sup> Back in Liverpool, he confessed &#34;everything&#34; to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions Epstein had revealed his ambition of becoming an <a href="/wiki/Actor" id="w">actor</a>, so his parents allowed him go to London to study.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp261_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp261" title="">[8]</a></sup>      </p>
<p>Epstein attended the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Academy_of_Dramatic_Art" id="w">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> (RADA) in London. His RADA classmates included actors <a href="/wiki/Susannah_York" id="w">Susannah York</a>, <a href="/wiki/Albert_Finney" id="w">Albert Finney</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peter_O%26%2339%3BToole" id="w">Peter O&#39;Toole</a>, but Epstein dropped out after the third term. Back in Liverpool, Harry Epstein put his son in charge of the record department of the newly-opened NEMS music store on Great Charlotte Street.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp263_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp263" title="">[9]</a></sup> Epstein worked &#34;day and night&#34; at the store to make it a success, and it became one of the biggest musical retail outlets in the North of England.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp264_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp264" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Epsteins opened a second store at 12-14 Whitechapel, and Epstein was put in charge of the entire operation. Epstein often walked across the road to the <a href="/wiki/Lewis%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">Lewis&#39;s</a> department store—which had a music section—where <a href="/wiki/Peter_Brown_(music_industry)" id="w">Peter Brown</a> was employed. He watched Brown&#39;s sales technique and was impressed enough to lure Brown to work for NEMS with the offer of a higher salary and a commission on sales.<sup id="_ref-Brownp63_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brownp63" title="">[11]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/3_August" id="w">3 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1961" id="w">1961</a>, Epstein started a regular music column in the <i><a href="/wiki/Mersey_Beat" id="w">Mersey Beat</a></i> magazine, called, &#39;Record Releases, by Brian Epstein of NEMS&#39;.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp257_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp257" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

The Beatles&#39; name was supposedly first noticed by Epstein in issues of Mersey Beat, and on numerous posters around Liverpool, before asking <a href="/wiki/Bill_Harry" id="w">Bill Harry</a> who they were (Harry had previously convinced Epstein to sell the Mersey Beat magazine at NEMS).<sup id="_ref-Milesp84_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp84" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Milesp84-85_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp84-85" title="">[13]</a></sup> The Beatles were featured on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp264-265_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp264-265" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-MilesPage88_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MilesPage88" title="">[15]</a></sup> The Beatles had recorded the &#39;<a href="/wiki/My_Bonnie" id="w">My Bonnie</a>&#39; <a href="/wiki/Single_(music)" id="w">single</a> with <a href="/wiki/Tony_Sheridan" id="w">Tony Sheridan</a> in <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>, and some months after its release Epstein asked <a href="/wiki/Alistair_Taylor" id="w">Alistair Taylor</a> about it in NEMS.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp265_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp265" title="">[16]</a></sup> Epstein&#39;s version of the story was that a customer—Raymond Jones—walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the &#34;My Bonnie&#34; single, which made Epstein curious about the group.<sup id="_ref-BiographyofEpstein_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BiographyofEpstein" title="">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Beatles were due to perform a lunchtime concert in the <a href="/wiki/Cavern_Club" id="w">Cavern Club</a> on <a href="/wiki/9_November" id="w">9 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1961" id="w">1961</a>, which was not far from the NEMS store. Epstein asked Bill Harry to arrange for Epstein and his assistant Taylor to watch them perform, and Epstein and Taylor were allowed into the club without queuing, with a welcome message being announced over the club&#39;s <a href="/wiki/PA_system" id="w">public-address system</a> by <a href="/wiki/Bob_Wooler" id="w">Bob Wooler</a>, who was the resident <a href="/wiki/DJ" id="w">DJ</a>.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp266-268_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp266-268" title="">[18]</a></sup> Epstein later talked about the performance: 
{{cquote}} 
After the performance, Epstein and Taylor went into the <a href="/wiki/Dressing_room" id="w">dressing room</a>—which was &#34;as big a broom cupboard&#34;—to talk to them.<sup id="_ref-”TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD”_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-”TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD”" title="">[19]</a></sup> The Beatles immediately recognised Epstein—as they were regular customers at NEMS—but before Epstein could congratulate them on their performance, <a href="/wiki/George_Harrison" id="w">George Harrison</a> said, &#34;And what brings <i>Mr. Epstein</i> here?&#34;<sup id="_ref-Spitzp268_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp268" title="">[20]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Beatles played at the Cavern over the next three weeks, and Epstein was always there to watch them. Epstein contacted their previous manager, <a href="/wiki/Allan_Williams" id="w">Allan Williams</a>, to confirm that Williams no longer had any ties to them, but Williams advised Epstein &#34;not to touch them with a <a href="/wiki/Barge_pole" id="w">barge pole</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Milesp75_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp75" title="">[21]</a></sup> In a meeting with the group at NEMS on <a href="/wiki/10_December" id="w">10 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1961" id="w">1961</a>, he proposed the idea of managing them.<sup id="_ref-MilesPage85_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MilesPage85" title="">[22]</a></sup> The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Epstein on <a href="/wiki/24_January" id="w">24 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a>.<sup id="_ref-MilesPage88_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MilesPage88" title="">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Although Epstein had had no prior experience of artist management, he had a strong influence on their early dress-code and attitude on stage. When Epstein discovered the band, they wore blue jeans and leather jackets, performing at rowdy <a href="/wiki/Rock_%26%2339%3Bn%26%2339%3B_roll" id="w">rock &#39;n&#39; roll</a> shows where they would stop and start songs when they felt like it, or when an audience member requested a certain song. Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties, insisted that they stop <a href="/wiki/Swearing" id="w">swearing</a>, smoking, drinking or eating onstage, and also suggested the famous synchronised bow at the end of their performances.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp279-280_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp279-280" title="">[23]</a></sup> McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein&#39;s ideas, believing it was—in part—due to Epstein&#39;s RADA training.<sup id="_ref-Milesp96_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp96" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Epstein made numerous trips to London to visit record companies with the hope of securing a record contract, but was rejected by many, including <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Records" id="w">Columbia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pye_Records" id="w">Pye</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philips_Records" id="w">Philips</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oriole_Records" id="w">Oriole</a>, and most famously, Decca [see <a href="/wiki/The_Decca_audition" id="w">The Decca audition</a>].<sup id="_ref-Milesp89_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp89" title="">[25]</a></sup> The Beatles later found out that Epstein had paid Decca producer <a href="/wiki/Tony_Meehan" id="w">Tony Meehan</a> (ex-drummer of the <a href="/wiki/The_Shadows" id="w">Shadows</a>) to produce the studio recordings.<sup id="_ref-Milesp89_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp89" title="">[25]</a></sup> While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he also approached <a href="/wiki/EMI" id="w">EMI</a> marketing executive Ron White, who later contacted EMI producers <a href="/wiki/Norrie_Paramor" id="w">Norrie Paramor</a>, Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell, but they all declined to record the group.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> White could not contact EMI&#39;s fourth staff producer (Martin) as he was on holiday.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/8_February" id="w">8 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a>, Epstein visited a <a href="/wiki/HMV" id="w">HMV</a> store in <a href="/wiki/Oxford_Street" id="w">Oxford Street</a>, London, to have the Decca audition tape transferred to disc. A <a href="/wiki/HMV" id="w">HMV</a> technician named Jim Foy liked the recordings, and suggested that Epstein should contact Parlophone&#39;s George Martin.<sup id="_ref-BeatlesHistory_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BeatlesHistory" title="">[29]</a></sup> The Beatles were signed by EMI&#39;s small Parlophone label after the group had been rejected by almost every other British record company, and without Martin ever having seen them play <a href="/wiki/Concert" id="w">live</a>.<sup id="_ref-Milesp90_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp90" title="">[30]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>Martin scheduled an audition—at <a href="/wiki/Abbey_Road_Studios" id="w">Abbey Road Studios</a>—which convinced Martin that they were good enough, but with one exception: Martin did not like drummer <a href="/wiki/Pete_Best" id="w">Pete Best</a>&#39;s playing.<sup id="_ref-Milesp90_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp90" title="">[30]</a></sup> When the news came that Martin wanted to replace Best on their recordings with a session drummer, <a href="/wiki/John_Lennon" id="w">John Lennon</a>, McCartney and Harrison asked Epstein to fire Best from the band. Epstein agonised about the decision, and asked Bob Wooler if it was a good idea, to which Wooler replied that Best was very popular with the fans and they wouldn&#39;t like it at all.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp329_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp329" title="">[31]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Ringo_Starr" id="w">Ringo Starr</a> took his place, as Starr had previously played with <a href="/wiki/Rory_Storm" id="w">Rory Storm and the Hurricanes</a>, and had previously stepped in to drum with them when Best was ill or unable to play.<sup id="_ref-Milesp90_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp90" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Beatles toured the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippines</a> in July 1966, but Epstein unintentionally snubbed the nation&#39;s first lady, <a href="/wiki/Imelda_Marcos" id="w">Imelda Marcos</a>, when presented with an invitation to a breakfast party.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp619_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp619" title="">[32]</a></sup> Epstein politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group&#39;s policy to accept such official invitations.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp620_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp620" title="">[33]</a></sup> The Beatles and their entourage were ejected from their hotel the same day and were given a police escort to the airport. They boarded the plane to fly home, but Epstein and <a href="/wiki/Mal_Evans" id="w">Mal Evans</a> were ordered off, with both believing they would not be allowed back on the plane.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp624_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp624" title="">[34]</a></sup> Epstein was forced to give back most of the money that they had earned in the Philippines before being allowed back on the plane.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp625_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp625" title="">[35]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="After_Candlestick_Park" name="After_Candlestick_Park"></a><h3>After Candlestick Park</h3>
<p>The Beatles&#39; hectic schedule of touring, television, and film work between 1963-65 kept Epstein very busy. The Beatles&#39; last live concert was at <a href="/wiki/Candlestick_Park" id="w">Candlestick Park</a> in San Francisco, California on <a href="/wiki/29_August" id="w">29 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1966" id="w">1966</a>, and Epstein&#39;s management duties changed to reflect the changing nature of their  career. He wanted them to continue touring, however, but they adamantly refused.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp666_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp666" title="">[36]</a></sup> The Beatles started to pay less attention to Epstein&#39;s advice on many issues after they stopped touring, such as the legally risky cover art of <i><a href="/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%26%2339%3Bs_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band" id="w">Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></i>. Epstein later brought <a href="/wiki/Robert_Stigwood" id="w">Robert Stigwood</a> into the NEMS organisation, and wanted to sell the control of NEMS to him, but didn&#39;t tell any of the group about his decision.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp725-726_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp725-726" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Before Epstein&#39;s death, McCartney had been taking a much more active interest in NEMS&#39; finances, and the group was becoming aware that some artists with more ruthless managers—such as the <a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stones" id="w">Rolling Stones</a> under <a href="/wiki/Allen_Klein" id="w">Allen Klein</a>—claimed to be receiving more commercially advantageous terms. After Epstein&#39;s death, Stigwood wanted to take over the management of NEMS—believing that he was the &#34;natural successor&#34;—but Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr all vehemently opposed him, with Lennon saying, &#34;We don&#39;t know you.

McCartney admitted that they signed all the contracts Epstein presented to them without reading them first, but when Lennon was asked for a comment about Epstein&#39;s business dealings after Epstein’s death, he said, &#34;Well, he was alright. I&#39;ve found out since, of course, that he wasn&#39;t quite as honest to us as he made out&#34;—although many other interviews with Lennon report him as being very loyal to Epstein, and even saying, &#34;We had complete faith in him when he was running us. To us, he was the expert&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Milesp146_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp146" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-McCabeSchonfeldFortheRecord_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McCabeSchonfeldFortheRecord" title="">[39]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-EpsteininBillHarryBook_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EpsteininBillHarryBook" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Beatles all signed Epstein&#39;s first management contract, but Epstein did not sign it himself, thereby giving himself the option of withdrawing at any time. The contract could not have been legally binding on McCartney and Harrison, as they were both still <a href="/wiki/Minor_(law)" id="w">minors</a> (the age of majority at that time was 21) and lacked the <a href="/wiki/Legal_capacity#Natural persons" id="w">legal capacity</a> to sign a <a href="/wiki/Contract" id="w">binding contract</a>. The contract stated that Epstein would receive a management commission of 25 per cent of their <a href="/wiki/Gross_income" id="w">gross income</a> after a certain threshold had been reached.<sup id="_ref-MilesPage88_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MilesPage88" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-MilesPage144-145_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MilesPage144-145" title="">[41]</a></sup> The Beatles argued for a smaller percentage, but Epstein pointed out that he had been paying their <a href="/wiki/Expenses" id="w">expenses</a> for months, without receiving anything in return.<sup id="_ref- CynthiaJohnp103_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- CynthiaJohnp103" title="">[42]</a></sup> Epstein once offered the individual Beatles a fixed wage of £50-a-week for life, instead of receiving money from record sales. Harrison commented that he was earning £25 a week at the time, which was more than the £10 a week his father was earning, but the group as a whole declined Epstein&#39;s offer, as they thought that they were worth much more than £50-a-week.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> After the release of <a href="/wiki/Love_Me_Do" id="w">Love Me Do</a> in 1962, Epstein signed a second (and legally binding) contract.<sup id="_ref-LewisohnChronicles_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LewisohnChronicles" title="">[44]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-BeatlesContracts_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BeatlesContracts" title="">[45]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The Beatles&#39; recording contract that EMI offered Epstein gave them one <a href="/wiki/Penny" id="w">penny</a> for each record sold, which was split amongst the four members, meaning one <a href="/wiki/British_Farthing_coin" id="w">farthing</a> per group member.<sup id="_ref-History62_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-History62" title="">[46]</a></sup> The royalty rate was further reduced for singles sold outside the UK, on which the group received half of one penny (again split between the whole band) per single.<sup id="_ref-Brownp79_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brownp79" title="">[47]</a></sup> Martin said later that EMI had &#34;nothing to lose&#34; by signing a contract with them.<sup id="_ref-GeorgeMartinBeatleMoney_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GeorgeMartinBeatleMoney" title="">[48]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Beatles&#39; concerts were booked by Epstein himself, and he also presented groups managed by NEMS as an opening act, thereby making money for NEMS as the <a href="/wiki/Entrepreneur" id="w">promoter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Talent_agent" id="w">booking agent</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Manager" id="w">Manager</a> for all the concerts.<sup id="_ref-Brownp102_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brownp102" title="">[49]</a></sup> The Beatles were constantly in demand by concert promoters, and Epstein took advantage of the situation to avoid paying some <a href="/wiki/Tax" id="w">taxes</a> by accepting &#34;hidden&#34; fees on the night of a performance, which he always kept in a brown paper bag.<sup id="_ref-Brownp110_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brownp110" title="">[50]</a></sup> Epstein also successfully managed Gerry &#38; the Pacemakers, Billy J.

<p>During the first Beatles&#39; flight to America Epstein was offered numerous samples of products by merchandisers—who required a licence from Epstein to be allowed to sell them—including clocks, pens, plastic wigs, bracelets, and games, but Epstein rejected all of them. David Jacobs, the lawyer for NEMS, had already given away some exclusive merchandising rights to Nicky Byrne in <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, which later turned out to be a financial mistake as Epstein had asked for a percentage that was far below the norm at the time.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp465-466_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp465-466" title="">[51]</a></sup> The Beatles were ensconced in the Plaza hotel in <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>, and Epstein was further besieged by calls and visits from merchandisers, promoters, television commentators, and hustlers—all demanding to talk to him.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp458-464_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp458-464" title="">[52]</a></sup> Mindful of the number of records the group were selling in America, <a href="/wiki/Capitol_records" id="w">Capitol records</a> sent a well-spoken <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire" id="w">Yorkshire</a> girl, Wendy Hanson, to the Plaza hotel to act as Epstein&#39;s secretary, and to filter his calls.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp464_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp464" title="">[53]</a></sup> Hanson later worked solely with Epstein in his Albemarle Street office, which was separate from the NEMS office.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp667_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp667" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>Epstein asked James Trevor Isherwood (a <a href="/wiki/Chartered_Accountant" id="w">Chartered Accountant</a>) to set up a company to collect Lennon and McCartney&#39;s <a href="/wiki/PRS" id="w">PRS</a> payments—called Lenmac—which he did on <a href="/wiki/12_May" id="w">12 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1964" id="w">1964</a>.

<p>The Beatles entered into a publishing agreement with <a href="/wiki/Dick_James" id="w">Dick James</a> Music (DJM) who set up a company called <a href="/wiki/Northern_Songs" id="w">Northern Songs</a>. Epstein agreed that James should receive 25 per cent of the shares, and Charles Silver—his financial partner and <a href="/wiki/Accountant" id="w">accountant</a>—should also receive 25 per cent. Lennon and McCartney received 20 per cent each, and Epstein held the remaining 10 per cent.<sup id="_ref-Milesp147_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp147" title="">[58]</a></sup> The Beatles PRS income increased rapidly, and Epstein asked Isherwood to work out a way of avoiding the tax that Lennon and McCartney would have to pay. Isherwood suggested a <a href="/wiki/Initial_public_offering" id="w">Stock-market flotation</a> for Northern Songs, and further advised Epstein that Lennon and McCartney should move to houses near his [Isherwood&#39;s] in <a href="/wiki/Esher" id="w">Esher</a> during the flotation, which Lennon, Harrison, and Starr did—with only Epstein and McCartney remaining in London.<sup id="_ref-Milesp166-167_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp166-167" title="">[59]</a></sup> </p>
<p>After moving to London Epstein rented an office in Monmouth Street—close to <a href="/wiki/Seven_Dials" id="w">Seven Dials</a>—in 1965, and later leased the <a href="/wiki/Saville_Theatre" id="w">Saville Theatre</a> on <a href="/wiki/Shaftesbury_Avenue" id="w">Shaftesbury Avenue</a>. He promoted new works by writers such as <a href="/wiki/Arnold_Wesker" id="w">Arnold Wesker</a> in productions that occasionally fell afoul of the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chamberlain" id="w">Lord Chamberlain</a> by including &#34;obscene&#34; content or nudity.

Epstein was <a href="/wiki/Homosexual" id="w">homosexual</a>, which was not publicly known until a long time after his death, although it was an open secret among his friends and business associates.<sup id="_ref-Milesp88_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp88" title="">[65]</a></sup> </p>
<p>While Epstein was in the Army, he had a tailor make an officer&#39;s uniform for him that he wore when <a href="/wiki/Cruising_for_sex" id="w">cruising</a> the bars of London, but was arrested one night (for impersonating an officer) at the Army and Navy Club on <a href="/wiki/Piccadilly" id="w">Piccadilly</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Military_Police" id="w">Military Police</a>. Epstein managed to avoid a <a href="/wiki/Court_martial" id="w">court martial</a> by agreeing to see an army psychiatrist, who uncovered Epstein&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality" id="w">homosexuality</a>.<sup id="_ref-MilesPage86_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MilesPage86" title="">[66]</a></sup> He was discharged from the army after ten months on the medical grounds of being &#34;emotionally and mentally unfit&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp260_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp260" title="">[67]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Whilst Epstein was studying acting at RADA, he was arrested for &#34;<a href="/wiki/Cottaging" id="w">persistent importuning</a>&#34;, and was later blackmailed by an ex-<a href="/wiki/Coldstream_Guards" id="w">Guardsman</a>—Billy Connolly—which led to him dropping out after his third term. Throughout the later court case against Connolly, Epstein was referred to as &#34;Mr. X&#34;, as the law allowed anonymity at that time.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp262_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp262" title="">[68]</a></sup> McCartney said that he and the others knew that Epstein was a homosexual, but they did not care, because Epstein greatly encouraged them when record companies turned them down, and used to take them to late-night drinking clubs, to which they had previously never had access.<sup id="_ref-MilesPage88_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MilesPage88" title="">[15]</a></sup> Although Lennon often made sarcastic comments about Epstein&#39;s homosexuality to friends and to Epstein personally, nobody outside their closed circle was allowed to comment on it. Ian Sharp—one of Lennon&#39;s art school friends—once made a sarcastic remark about Epstein but was sent a letter by Epstein&#39;s office within forty-eight hours that demanded a complete apology. Sharp apologised but was then completely ostracised, and was told by McCartney in a letter to have no contact at all with any of them in the future.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp302-303_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp302-303" title="">[69]</a></sup></p>

Lennon always denied this, telling <i><a href="/wiki/Playboy" id="w">Playboy</a></i> in 1980: &#34;It was never consummated, but we had a pretty intense relationship.&#34; Lennon&#39;s first wife Cynthia also maintains that Lennon&#39;s relationship with Epstein was platonic.<sup id="_ref- CynthiaJohnp104_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- CynthiaJohnp104" title="">[70]</a></sup> A fictionalised account of the Spanish holiday was portrayed in the film 1991 <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hours_and_Times" id="w">The Hours and Times</a></i>. Lennon&#39;s friend and confidant, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Shotton" id="w">Peter Shotton</a>, claimed in his book, <i>The Beatles, Lennon and Me</i>, that under provocation from Epstein, Lennon did partly give in: &#34;I let him <a href="/wiki/Handjob" id="w">toss me off</a>, and that was it.&#34; Biographer <a href="/wiki/Hunter_Davies" id="w">Hunter Davies</a> also recalled Lennon telling him he had consented to an encounter &#34;to see what it was like.&#34; Writer <a href="/wiki/Albert_Goldman" id="w">Albert Goldman</a> expanded on both claims in his <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lives_of_John_Lennon" id="w">The Lives of John Lennon</a></i>, alleging a longtime affair between the two men. Despite his soft-spoken manner and dapper appearance, Epstein was strongly attracted to &#34;<a href="/wiki/Trade_(Homosexual)" id="w">rough trade</a>&#34;, often seeking illicit encounters with abusive partners, and was subjected to blackmail, battery, and threats. </p>
<p>Epstein&#39;s strongest relationship with a woman was with <a href="/wiki/Alma_Cogan" id="w">Alma Cogan</a>, who was also Jewish and was a part of the glitzy world of old-fashioned show business. Epstein always bought her presents when he was abroad, and even took her to Liverpool to meet his parents.

<p>Peter Brown claimed in his memoir, <i>The Love You Make: An Insider&#39;s Story of The Beatles</i>, that he had once found a suicide note written by Epstein and spoke with him directly about it.

He explained that he had simply had taken one pill too many and that he did not intend to overdose and promised to be more careful from then on. Brown later wrote that he wondered if he was really doing Epstein a favour by not showing the note to Epstein&#39;s doctor, Norman Cowan, who more than likely would have stopped prescribing drugs for Epstein.<sup id="_ref-BrownTheLoveYouMakep31_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BrownTheLoveYouMakep31" title="">[87]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Beatles did not attend Epstein&#39;s funeral, wishing to give his family privacy by not attracting the media and fans. A few weeks later, however, all four attended a memorial service for Epstein at the New London Synagogue in <a href="/wiki/St._John%26%2339%3Bs_Wood" id="w">St. John&#39;s Wood</a> (near the Abbey Road studios) which was officiated by Rabbi <a href="/wiki/Louis_Jacobs" id="w">Louis Jacobs</a>, who eulogised Epstein, saying, “He encouraged young people to sing of love and peace rather than war and hatred.” Epstein is buried in the <a href="/wiki/Kirkdale%2C_Liverpool" id="w">Kirkdale</a> Jewish Cemetery in Liverpool (section A grave H12).

<div class="thumbcaption">The telegram that Epstein sent to <a href="/wiki/Mersey_Beat" id="w">Mersey Beat</a> magazine to announce that he had secured The Beatles their first recording contract.</div></div>

The Beatles were among the earliest entrants into the <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, but the man regarded as having been responsible for guiding them to their success has never been considered for membership in the Hall&#39;s &#34;Non-Performer&#39;s Section&#34;. Epstein was earlier overlooked when Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr were honoured with the <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" id="w">MBE</a> in 1965 (even though Harrison once said that the MBE stood for &#34;Mister Brian Epstein&#34;). <a href="/wiki/Martin_Lewis" id="w">Martin Lewis</a>—previously Taylor&#39;s assistant—created &#34;The Official Brian Epstein Website&#34;, which includes a <a href="/wiki/Petition" id="w">petition</a> that Epstein be inducted into the <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>.<sup id="_ref-EpsteindotCom_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EpsteindotCom" title="">[89]</a></sup> Lewis also organized the 1998 re-publication (in the U.S.) of Epstein&#39;s 1964 autobiography, <i><a href="/wiki/A_Cellarful_of_Noise" id="w">A Cellarful of Noise</a></i>.</p>
<p>After Epstein&#39;s death, clashes between members began to surface, culminating with the group&#39;s slow dissolution between 1969-1970. McCartney summarised the importance of Epstein when he was interviewed, in 1997, for a BBC documentary about Epstein by stating: &#34;If anyone was the Fifth Beatle, it was Brian.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Fifth Beatle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fifth Beatle" title="">[90]</a></sup> In his 1970 <a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" id="w">Rolling Stone</a> interview, John Lennon commented about Epstein&#39;s death: &#34;I knew that we were in trouble then ...
