<b>Exploding whales</b> have been documented on two notable occasions, as well as several lesser-known ones. The most famous <a href="/wiki/Explosion" id="w">explosion</a> occurred in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> at <a href="/wiki/Florence%2C_Oregon" id="w">Florence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oregon" id="w">Oregon</a>, in 1970, when a dead <a href="/wiki/Sperm_whale" id="w">sperm whale</a> (originally reported as a <a href="/wiki/Gray_whale" id="w">gray whale</a>) was blown up by the <a href="/wiki/Oregon_Department_of_Transportation" id="w">Oregon Highway Division</a> in an attempt to dispose of its rotting <a href="/wiki/Body" id="w">carcass</a>. This incident became famous in the U.S. when American <a href="/wiki/Humorist" id="w">humorist</a> <a href="/wiki/Dave_Barry" id="w">Dave Barry</a> wrote about it in his newspaper column after viewing a videotape of television footage of the explosion. It later became well-known internationally when the same footage <a href="/wiki/Viral_video" id="w">circulated on the Internet</a>. </p>
<p>There have also been spontaneous explosions. The other best-reported case of an exploding whale was in <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" id="w">Taiwan</a> in 2004, when a buildup of <a href="/wiki/Gas" id="w">gas</a> inside a <a href="/wiki/Decomposition" id="w">decomposing</a> sperm whale caused it to explode while it was being transported for a <a href="/wiki/Post-mortem" id="w">post-mortem</a> examination. As exploding whales are an interesting and absurd topic, they have been written about by several authors.</p>
<a id="Incidents" name="Incidents"></a><h1>Incidents</h1>
<p>Documented cases of <a href="/wiki/Exploding_animal" id="w">exploding animals</a> are fairly rare. Whale explosions in the United States and Taiwan were widely covered by the world press. However, there have been less famous incidents in other parts of the world. </p>

They thought <a href="/wiki/Burial" id="w">burying</a> the whale would be ineffective, as it would soon be uncovered, and they believed the use of dynamite would cause an explosion that would disintegrate the whale into pieces small enough for <a href="/wiki/Scavenger" id="w">scavengers</a> to clear up. The engineer in charge of the operation, George Thornton, was recorded as stating that one set of charges might not be enough and more might be needed. Thornton later explained that he was chosen to remove the whale because the district engineer, Dale Allen, had gone <a href="/wiki/Hunting" id="w">hunting</a>.<sup id="_ref-linnmantranscript_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-linnmantranscript" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-snopes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-snopes" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The resulting explosion was caught on film by television photographer Doug Brazil for a story reported by <a href="/wiki/Journalist" id="w">news reporter</a> <a href="/wiki/Paul_Linnman" id="w">Paul Linnman</a> of <a href="/wiki/KATU" id="w">KATU</a>-TV in <a href="/wiki/Portland%2C_Oregon" id="w">Portland, Oregon</a>.  In his <a href="/wiki/Voiceover" id="w">voiceover</a>, Linnman joked that &#34;land-lubber newsmen&#34; became &#34;land-<i>blubber</i> newsmen&#34;, for &#34;the blast blasted blubber beyond all believable bounds.&#34;<sup id="_ref-linnmantranscript_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-linnmantranscript" title="">[4]</a></sup> The explosion caused large pieces of <a href="/wiki/Blubber" id="w">blubber</a> to land some distance away from the beach, resulting in a smashed car. The explosion disintegrated only some of the whale, most of which remained on the beach for the Oregon Highway Division workers to clear away.</p>
<p>At the end of his news story, Paul Linnman noted that &#34;It might be concluded that should a whale ever be washed ashore in <a href="/wiki/Lane_County%2C_Oregon" id="w">Lane County</a> again, those in charge will not only remember what to do, they&#39;ll certainly remember what <i>not</i> to do.&#34; It was reported in the ODOT&#39;s employee newspaper, <i>TranScript</i>, that when 41 sperm whales beached nearby in 1979, state parks officials burned and buried them.<sup id="_ref-transcriptwhaledisposal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-transcriptwhaledisposal" title="">[6]</a></sup> Today, beach managers tow dead beached whales to the open sea. This is done mainly for safety reasons, as the rotting corpses have been known to attract <a href="/wiki/Shark" id="w">sharks</a> and so become a danger to beach users. </p>
<p>For several years, the story of the exploding whale was commonly disbelieved and thought to be an <a href="/wiki/Urban_legend" id="w">urban legend</a>. However, it was brought to widespread public attention by popular writer <a href="/wiki/Dave_Barry" id="w">Dave Barry</a> in his <i><a href="/wiki/Miami_Herald" id="w">Miami Herald</a></i> column of <a href="/wiki/May_20" id="w">May 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a>, when he reported that he had footage of the event. Barry wrote, &#34;Here at the Institute we watch it often, especially at parties.&#34; Some time later the Oregon State Highway division started to receive calls from the media after a shortened version of the article was distributed on <a href="/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" id="w">bulletin boards</a> under the title &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Far_Side" id="w">The Farside</a> Comes To Life In Oregon&#34;. However, the piece did not explain that the event had happened approximately twenty five years previously and whoever had copied Barry&#39;s article neglected to include the authorship of the piece. Dave Barry says that on a fairly regular basis someone forwards him the &#34;authorless&#34; column and suggests he write something about the described incident.(<a href="/wiki/#Reference-idBarry1996" id="w">Barry 1996</a>, pp. 164-65) Due to these oversights, an article in the ODOT&#39;s <i>TranScript</i> notes that</p>

Their critical emails were subsequently published by the bemused site webmasters.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>The story of Oregon&#39;s exploding whale was widely known on <a href="/wiki/Usenet" id="w">Usenet</a> for quite some time and was in particular discussed on <a href="/wiki/Alt.folklore.urban" id="w">alt.folklore.urban</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Newsgroup" id="w">newsgroup</a> devoted to urban legends. The incident, including a complete copy of Barry&#39;s article, was recorded in the newsgroup&#39;s 1991 <a href="/wiki/FAQ" id="w">FAQ</a>, then maintained by Peter van der Linden, where it was marked as &#34;Tb&#34; (believed true, but not conclusively proven).<sup id="_ref-petervanderlinden_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-petervanderlinden" title="">[8]</a></sup> In 1992, after newsgroup poster &#34;<a href="/wiki/Snopes" id="w">snopes</a>&#34; tried to verify whether this was true or not, the newsgroup received confirmation that it was a true story and marked it as true.<sup id="_ref-davidpmikkelson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-davidpmikkelson" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

In this incident, a buildup of gas inside a decomposing <a href="/wiki/Sperm_whale" id="w">sperm whale</a>, measuring 17 m (55 ft 9 in) long and weighing 50 tons, caused it to burst. The older bull whale had died after becoming beached on the southwestern coast of Taiwan, and it had taken more than 13 hours, three large <a href="/wiki/Crane_(machine)" id="w">cranes</a>, and 50 workers to shift the beached sperm whale onto the back of a truck.</p>
<p>While the whale was being moved <i><a href="/wiki/Taiwan_News" id="w">Taiwan News</a></i> reported that &#34;a large crowd of more than 600 local <a href="/wiki/Yunlin_County" id="w">Yunlin</a> residents and curiosity seekers, along with vendors selling snack food and hot drinks, braved the cold temperature and chilly wind to watch workmen try to haul away the dead marine <a href="/wiki/Leviathan" id="w">leviathan</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-jasonpan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jasonpan" title="">[11]</a></sup> Professor Wang Chien-ping had ordered the whale be moved to the <a href="/wiki/Sutsao_Wild_Life_Reservation_Area" id="w">Sutsao Wild Life Reservation Area</a> after he had been refused permission to perform a <a href="/wiki/Post-mortem" id="w">post-mortem</a> at the <a href="/wiki/National_Cheng_Kung_University" id="w">National Cheng Kung University</a> in Tainan.

<p>The explosion was reported to have splattered blood and whale entrails over surrounding shop-fronts, bystanders, and cars. <a href="/wiki/BBC_News_Online" id="w">BBC News Online</a> interviewed an unnamed Taiwanese local who said, &#34;What a stinking mess.

<p>Several authors have written about exploding whales: their unusual, absurd, and improbable nature makes them a potentially interesting literary topic.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australian</a> children&#39;s book author <a href="/wiki/Paul_Jennings_(Australian_author)" id="w">Paul Jennings</a> wrote a book called <i>Uncanny!: Even More Surprising Stories</i> that features a story about a father and son being given the task of blowing up a dead whale with <a href="/wiki/Gelignite" id="w">gelignite</a>.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Patrick_O%26%2339%3BBrian" id="w">Patrick O&#39;Brian</a>&#39;s short story <i>Two&#39;s Company</i>, written in 1937, features a large whale that is washed up against an isolated <a href="/wiki/Lighthouse" id="w">lighthouse</a> occupied by two lighthouse keepers, creating a &#34;seabird and shark feeding frenzy, not to mention an atrocious stench&#34;. The men beg for some explosives from the destroyer sent to re-supply them so they can dispose of the carcass.</li></ul>

<li>In <a href="/wiki/Julian_May" id="w">Julian May</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Saga_of_Pliocene_Exile" id="w">Saga of Pliocene Exile</a></i> series, a trickster genius character named <a href="/wiki/Aiken_Drum" id="w">Aiken Drum</a> blows up a beached whale-like creature on the planet Dalriada, causing messy and disgusting results.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%26%2339%3Bs_Guide_to_the_Galaxy" id="w">The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Douglas_Adams" id="w">Douglas Adams</a>, while in orbit about a remote planet the ship <i>Heart of Gold</i>, powered by the <a href="/wiki/Infinite_Improbability_Drive" id="w">Infinite Improbability Drive</a>, changes two nuclear missiles into a <a href="/wiki/Sperm_whale" id="w">sperm whale</a> and a bowl of <a href="/wiki/Petunia" id="w">petunias</a>, which fall and create &#34;a crater about a hundred and fifty yards wide&#34; on the planet&#39;s surface.  Adams was inspired to write this episode by watching the American detective drama <i><a href="/wiki/Cannon_(TV_series)" id="w">Cannon</a></i>. In this, as he described it, an overweight detective killed someone at the end of each episode for no adequately explored reason. So he simply reversed the situation and had a whale killed for no adequately explored reason.</li></ul>

<li>A recording of <a href="/wiki/Paul_Linnman" id="w">Paul Linnman</a>&#39;s coverage of the Oregon whale explosion was used in the song &#34;Disconnect (No Respectable Seagull)&#34; by Chicago band <a href="/wiki/Atombombpocketknife" id="w">Atombombpocketknife</a>.
