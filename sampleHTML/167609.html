<b>Rail transport</b> is a commonly used mode of long-distance <a href="/wiki/Transport_in_India" id="w">transportation</a> in <b><a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a></b>. Almost all rail operations in India are handled by a state-owned company, <a href="/wiki/Indian_Railways" id="w">Indian Railways</a>, under the federal Ministry of Railways. The rail network traverses the length and breadth of the country, covering a total length of {{km to mi}}.<sup id="_ref-salient_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-salient" title="">[1]</a></sup> It is said to be the 2nd largest railway network in the world, transporting over 5&#160;<a href="/wiki/EMD_E9" id="w">billion</a> passengers and over 350 million&#160;<a href="/wiki/Tonne" id="w">tonnes</a> of <a href="/wiki/Cargo" id="w">freight</a> annually.<sup id="_ref-salient_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-salient" title="">[1]</a></sup> Its operations cover <a href="/wiki/States_and_territories_of_India" id="w">twenty-eight states and three union territories</a> and also provide limited service to <a href="/wiki/Nepal" id="w">Nepal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh" id="w">Bangladesh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a>.</p>
<p>Railways were introduced to India in 1853,<sup id="_ref-irfcastamp_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcastamp" title="">[2]</a></sup> and by the time of <a href="/wiki/Independence_of_India" id="w">India&#39;s independence</a> in 1947 they had grown to forty-two rail systems. In 1951 the systems were <a href="/wiki/Nationalisation" id="w">nationalised</a> as one unit—<a href="/wiki/Indian_Railways" id="w">Indian Railways</a>—to form one of the largest networks in the world. <a href="/wiki/Locomotive" id="w">Locomotives</a> manufactured at several places in India are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. <a href="/wiki/Railway_signal#Color light signals" id="w">Colour signal lights</a> are used as signals, but in some remote areas of operation, the older <a href="/wiki/Railway_signal#Mechanical signals" id="w">semaphores and disc-based signalling</a> are still in use. Accommodation classes range from general through first class AC. Trains have been classified according to speed and area of operation. Many trains are officially identified by a four-digit code, though many are commonly known by unique names. The ticketing system has been computerised to a large extent, and there are reserved as well as unreserved categories of tickets.

Indian Railways use a specialised classification code for identifying its locomotives. The code is usually three or four letters, followed by a digit identifying the model (either assigned chronologically or encoding the power rating of the locomotive).<sup id="_ref-irfcalocogen_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcalocogen" title="">[5]</a></sup> This could be followed by other codes for minor variations in the base model.</p>
<p>The three (or four) letters are, from left to right, the gauge of tracks on which the locomotive operates, the type of power source or fuel for the locomotive, and the kind of operation the locomotive can be used for.<sup id="_ref-irfcalocogen_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcalocogen" title="">[5]</a></sup> The gauge is coded as &#39;W&#39; for broad gauge, &#39;Y&#39; for metre gauge, &#39;Z&#39; for the 762&#160;mm narrow gauge and &#39;N&#39; for the 610&#160;mm narrow gauge. The power source code is &#39;D&#39; for diesel, &#39;A&#39; for AC traction, &#39;C&#39; for DC traction and &#39;CA&#39; for dual traction (AC/DC). The operation letter is &#39;G&#39; for freight-only operation, &#39;P&#39; for passenger trains-only operation, &#39;M&#39; for mixed operation (both passenger and freight) and &#39;S&#39; for shunting operation. A number alongside it indicates the power rating of the engine.<sup id="_ref-irfcalocogen_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcalocogen" title="">[5]</a></sup> For example &#39;4&#39; would indicate a power rating of above 4,000&#160;<a href="/wiki/Horsepower" id="w">hp</a> (2,980&#160;<a href="/wiki/Kilowatt" id="w">kW</a>) but below 5,000&#160;hp (3,730&#160;kW). A letter following the number is used to give an exact rating. For instance &#39;A&#39; would be an additional 100&#160;horsepower; &#39;B&#39; 200&#160;hp and so on. For example, a WDM-3D is a broad-gauge, diesel-powered, mixed mode (suitable for both freight and passenger duties) and has a power rating of 3400&#160;<a href="/wiki/Horsepower" id="w">hp</a> (2.5&#160;<a href="/wiki/Megawatt" id="w">MW</a>).</p>
<p>The most common diesel engine used is the <a href="/wiki/WDM-2" id="w">WDM-2</a>, which entered production in 1962. This 2,600&#160;hp (1.9&#160;MW) locomotive was designed by <a href="/wiki/American_Locomotive_Company" id="w">Alco</a> and manufactured by the <a href="/wiki/Diesel_Locomotive_Works" id="w">Diesel Locomotive Works</a>, <a href="/wiki/Varanasi" id="w">Varanasi</a>, and is used as a standard workhorse.<sup id="_ref-irfcalocospecs_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcalocospecs" title="">[6]</a></sup> It is being replaced by more modern engines, ranging in power up to 4,000&#160;hp (3&#160;MW).

There is a wide variety of electric locomotives used, ranging between 2,800 to 6,350&#160;hp (2.1 to 4.7&#160;MW).<sup id="_ref-irfcalocospecs_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcalocospecs" title="">[6]</a></sup> They also accommodate the different track voltages in use. Most electrified sections in the country use 25,000&#160;<a href="/wiki/Volt" id="w">volt</a> <a href="/wiki/Alternating_current" id="w">AC</a>, but railway lines around <a href="/wiki/Mumbai" id="w">Mumbai</a> use the older 1,500&#160;V <a href="/wiki/Direct_current" id="w">DC</a> system.<sup id="_ref-irfcaparanjape_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcaparanjape" title="">[7]</a></sup> Thus, Mumbai and surrounding areas are the only places where one can find AC/DC dual locomotives of the WCAM and WCAG series. All other electric locomotives are pure AC ones from the WAP, WAG and WAM series. Some specialised <a href="/wiki/Electric_multiple_unit" id="w">electric multiple units</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Western_Railway_(India)" id="w">Western Railway</a> also use dual-power systems. There are also some very rare battery-powered locomotives, primarily used for shunting and yard work.</p>
<p>The only steam engines still in service in India operate on two heritage lines (<a href="/wiki/Darjeeling" id="w">Darjeeling</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ooty" id="w">Ooty</a>) and on the tourist train <i><a href="/wiki/Palace_on_Wheels" id="w">Palace on Wheels</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Plans are afoot to re-convert the <a href="/wiki/Neral%2C_India" id="w">Neral</a>-<a href="/wiki/Matheran" id="w">Matheran</a> to steam.</p>

<p>As of March 2007, {{convert}} of the total {{convert}} route length is electrified.<sup id="_ref-coreGI_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-coreGI" title="">[9]</a></sup> Most places use 25,000&#160;V AC through overhead <a href="/wiki/Catenary" id="w">catenary</a> delivery.<sup id="_ref-irfcatraction_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcatraction" title="">[10]</a></sup> A major exception is the entire Mumbai section, which uses 1,500&#160;V DC.<sup id="_ref-irfcatraction_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcatraction" title="">[10]</a></sup> This is currently undergoing change to the 25,000&#160;V system, and is scheduled for completion by 2008.

<a id="Signalling_systems" name="Signalling_systems"></a><h1>Signalling systems</h1>
<p>{{seealso}}
The Indian Railways makes use of <a href="/wiki/Railway_signal#Color light signals" id="w">colour signal lights</a>, but in some remote areas of operation, the older <a href="/wiki/Railway_signal#Mechanical signals" id="w">semaphores and discs-based signalling</a> (depending on the position or colour) are still in use.<sup id="_ref-irfcasignal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcasignal" title="">[11]</a></sup> Except for some high-traffic sections around large cities and junctions, the network does not use <a href="/wiki/Railway_signaling#Modern railway signalling" id="w">automatic block systems</a>. Safety therefore depends completely on the skill and vigilance of the personnel operating the individual signals and the drivers.</p>
<p>Coloured signalling makes use of multi-coloured lighting and in many places is automatically controlled. There are three modes:<sup id="_ref-irfcasignal_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcasignal" title="">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Two aspect signalling which makes use of a red (bottom) and green (top) lamp</li>
<li>Three aspect signalling which makes use of an additional amber lamp in the centre</li>
<li>Four (multiple) aspect signalling makes use of four lamps, the fourth is amber and is placed above the other three.</li></ul>
<p>Multiple aspect signals, by providing several intermediate speed stages between &#39;clear&#39; and &#39;on&#39;, allow high-speed trains sufficient time to brake safely if required. This becomes very important as train speeds rise. Without multiple-aspect signals, the stop signals have to be placed very far apart to allow sufficient braking distance and this reduces track utilisation. At the same time, slower trains can also be run closer together on track with multiple aspect signals.</p>
<p>Semaphores make use of a mechanical arm to indicate the line condition.
Several subtypes are used:<sup id="_ref-irfcasignal_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcasignal" title="">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Two aspect lower quadrant</li>
<li>Three aspect modified lower quadrant</li>
<li>Multiple aspect upper quadrant</li>
<li>Disc-based: These signals are located close to levers used to operate points. They are all two-aspect signals.</li></ul>

Trains are sorted into various categories which dictate the number of stops along their route, the priority they enjoy on the network, and the fare structure. Each express train is identified by a four-digit number<sup id="_ref-irfcanumber_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcanumber" title="">[16]</a></sup>—the first digit indicates the zone that operates the train, the second the division within the zone that controls the train and is responsible for its regular maintenance and cleanliness, and the last two digits are the train&#39;s serial number.</p>
<p>For super-fast trains, the first digit is always &#39;2&#39;,<sup id="_ref-irfcanumber_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcanumber" title="">[16]</a></sup> the second digit is the zone, the third is the division and only the last digit is the serial number within the division.

<p>Trains are classified by their average speed.<sup id="_ref-irfcarailops_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcarailops" title="">[19]</a></sup> A faster train has fewer stops (&#34;halts&#34;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.

India has some of the lowest train fares in the world, and passenger traffic is heavily subsidised by freight.<sup id="_ref-Joshi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Joshi" title="">[20]</a></sup> Until the late 1980s, Indian Railway ticket reservations were done manually. In late 1987, the Railways started using a computerised ticketing system. The entire ticketing system went online in 1995 to provide up to date information on status and availability. Today the ticketing network is computerised to a large extent, with the exception of some remote places. In large cities tickets can be booked for any two points in the country, which may not be available in smaller stations. Tickets can also be booked through the <a href="/wiki/Internet" id="w">internet</a> and via <a href="/wiki/Mobile_phone" id="w">mobile phones</a>, though this method carries an additional surcharge.</p>
<p>Discounted tickets are available for <a href="/wiki/Senior_citizen" id="w">senior citizens</a> (above sixty years) and some other categories of passengers including the disabled, students and high ranking government officials. One compartment of the lowest class of accommodation is earmarked for ladies in every passenger carrying train. Some berths or seats in sleeper class and second class are also earmarked for ladies.<sup id="_ref-reserverules_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reserverules" title="">[21]</a></sup> Season tickets permitting unlimited travel on specific sections or specific trains for a specific time period may also be available. Foreign tourists can buy an <a href="/wiki/Indrail_Pass" id="w">Indrail Pass</a>,<sup id="_ref-irfcafaqtravel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcafaqtravel" title="">[22]</a></sup> which is modelled on the lines of the <a href="/wiki/Eurail_Pass" id="w">Eurail Pass</a>, permitting unlimited travel in India for a specific time period.

For long-distance travel, reservation of a berth can be done for comfortable travel up to two months prior to the date of intended travel.<sup id="_ref-reserverules_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reserverules" title="">[21]</a></sup> Details such as the name, age and concession (if eligible) are required and are recorded on the ticket. The ticket price usually includes the base fare which depends on the classification of the train (example: super-fast surcharge if the train is classified as a super-fast), the class in which one wishes to travel and the reservation charge for overnight journeys.</p>
<p>If a seat is not available, then the ticket is given a wait listed number; else the ticket is <i>confirmed</i>, and a berth number is printed on the ticket. A person receiving a wait listed ticket will have to wait until there are enough cancellations to enable him to move up the list and obtain a confirmed ticket.<sup id="_ref-reserverules_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reserverules" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-irfcafaqtravel_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcafaqtravel" title="">[22]</a></sup> If his ticket is not confirmed on the day of departure, he may not board the train. Some of the tickets are assigned to the RAC or <a href="/wiki/Reservation_against_Cancellation" id="w">Reservation against Cancellation</a> which is between the waiting list and the confirmed list.<sup id="_ref-irfcafaqtravel_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcafaqtravel" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-reserverules_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reserverules" title="">[21]</a></sup> These allow the ticket holder to board the train and obtain an allotted seat decided by a ticket collector, after the ticket collector has ascertained that there is a vacant (absentee) seat.</p>
<p>Reserved Railway Tickets can be booked through the website of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited,<sup id="_ref-irctchome_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irctchome" title="">[23]</a></sup> and also through mobile Phones and <a href="/wiki/Short_message_service" id="w">SMS</a>. Tickets booked through this site are categorised in to iTickets and eTickets. iTickets are those, which are booked by a passenger and then printed and delivered to the passenger for carrying during journey. eTickets are those, which the passenger can print himself at his end and carry while travelling. For booking an eTicket, one needs one of the authorised valid Photo Identity Card. Cancellation of eTickets are also done online, without the requirement for the passenger to go to any counter. Non-reserved tickets are available for purchase on the platform at any time before departure. A non-reserved ticket holder may only board the general compartment class. All suburban networks issue non-reserved tickets valid for a limited time period. For frequent commuters, a season pass (monthly or quarterly) guarantees unlimited travel between two stops.</p>
<a id="International_links" name="International_links"></a><h1>International links</h1>

<p>After the creation of <a href="/wiki/East_Pakistan" id="w">East Pakistan</a> (later Bangladesh), many trains that used to run between Assam and Bengal had to be rerouted through the <a href="/wiki/Chicken%26%2339%3Bs_Neck" id="w">Chicken&#39;s Neck</a>. However as of 2005 there are no passenger links between India and Bangladesh. A metre gauge link exists between Mahisasan (Mohishashon) and Shahbazpur. Another link is between Radhikapur and Birol.

A move to link the Indian and Sri Lankan railways never materialised. A ferry service however connects the closest railheads between Indian and Sri Lanka.</p>
<a id="Private_railways" name="Private_railways"></a><h1>Private railways</h1>
<p>Though the <a href="/wiki/Indian_Railways" id="w">Indian Railways</a> enjoys a near monopoly in India, a few private railways do exist, left over from the days of the Raj, usually small sections on private estates, etc. There are also some railway lines owned and operated by companies for their own purposes, by plantations, sugar mills, collieries, mines, dams, harbours and ports, etc. The <a href="/wiki/Bombay_Port_Trust" id="w">Bombay Port Trust</a> runs a BG railway of its own, as does the <a href="/wiki/Madras_Port_Trust" id="w">Madras Port Trust</a>.<sup id="_ref-irfcaprvt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcaprvt" title="">[26]</a></sup> The Calcutta Port Commission Railway is a BG railway. The Vishakhapatnam Port Trust has BG and NG (2&#160;ft 6&#160;in) railways.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Bhilai_Steel_Plant" id="w">Bhilai Steel Plant</a> has a BG railway network.<sup id="_ref-irfcaprvt_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcaprvt" title="">[26]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Tata_Group" id="w">Tatas</a> (a private concern) operate funicular railways at Bhira and at Bhivpuri Road (as well as the Kamshet–Shirawta Dam railway line which is not a public line). These are not common carriers, so the general public cannot travel using these. The Pipavav Rail Corporation holds a 33-year concession for building and operating a railway line from Pipavav to Surendranagar.<sup id="_ref-irfcaprvt_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcaprvt" title="">[26]</a></sup> The Kutch Railway Company, a joint venture of the Gujarat state government and private parties, is involved (along with the Kandla Port Trust and the Gujarat Adani Port) to build a Gandhidham–Palanpur railway line.<sup id="_ref-irfcaprvt_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irfcaprvt" title="">[26]</a></sup> These railway lines are principally used to carry freight and not for passenger traffic.</p>
<p>Although generally IR has decided the freight tariffs on these lines, recently (February 2005) there have been proposals to allow the operating companies freedom to set freight tariffs and generally run the lines without reference to IR.</p>
