<p>{{Politics of the Philippines}}
A <b>city</b> (<b><i>lungsod</i></b>, sometimes <b><i>siyudad</i></b>, in <a href="/wiki/Filipino_language" id="w">Filipino</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tagalog_language" id="w">Tagalog</a>) is a tier of local government in the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippines</a>. Cities are in the same hierarchical level as <a href="/wiki/Philippine_municipality" id="w">municipalities</a>, but under the Local Government Code of 1991, cities are given special treatment in terms of bigger share from the internal revenue allotment (IRA) which forms part of the city&#39;s budget. Cities, like municipalities, are composed of <a href="/wiki/Barangay" id="w">barangays</a> and are governed by elective officials such as Mayor as Local Chief Executive, Vice-Mayor, and councilors as well as appointive officials heading the different local offices under them.</p>
<p>A number of cities in the country act independently from any  province and are self-governing as decreed by Philippine Law through an Act of Congress. They are classified as highly-urbanized cities. A significant number of these highly urbanized cities are in Metro Manila. The second type of cities are component cities, which are part of a province and are thus governed as part of the latter. They do not have autonomy or representation in the Philippine Congress, as Chartered Cities do. They depend on their provincial government for support and representation. Examples are <a href="/wiki/Tarlac_City" id="w">Tarlac City</a> in <a href="/wiki/Tarlac" id="w">Tarlac</a> province, and <a href="/wiki/Palayan_City" id="w">Palayan City</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Nueva_Ecija" id="w">Nueva Ecija</a> province, and <a href="/wiki/Pagadian_City" id="w">Pagadian City</a> in <a href="/wiki/Zamboanga_del_Sur" id="w">Zamboanga del Sur</a> province. There are, however, some component cities that are somewhat independent, like <a href="/wiki/Ormoc_City" id="w">Ormoc City</a> in <a href="/wiki/Leyte_province" id="w">Leyte</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Quezon_City" id="w">Quezon City</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Metro_Manila" id="w">Metro Manila</a> is the most populous city in the Philippines with over 2,000,000 residents. <a href="/wiki/Davao_City" id="w">Davao City</a>, is one of the largest cities in the world in terms of land area, occupying more than 2,500 square kilometers.</p>
<p>There are two <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_areas" id="w">metropolitan areas</a> in the Philippines. <a href="/wiki/Metro_Manila" id="w">Metro Manila</a> is the largest <a href="/wiki/Conurbation" id="w">conurbation</a> or urban <a href="/wiki/Agglomeration" id="w">agglomeration</a> in the country. It is composed of the city of <a href="/wiki/Manila" id="w">Manila</a> plus 15 neighboring cities and a municipality. The second is <a href="/wiki/Metro_Cebu" id="w">Metro Cebu</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cebu_Province" id="w">Cebu Province</a>. It is centered on <a href="/wiki/Cebu_City" id="w">Cebu City</a>, the provincial capital plus 12 surrounding cities and municipalities. </p>
<a id="Classification" name="Classification"></a><h2>Classification</h2>
<a id="City_classification" name="City_classification"></a><h3> City classification </h3>

<p>Prior to the enactment of the Local Government Code in 1991, all cities were considered <b>Chartered cities</b>. Chartered cities are those that have been created by an Act of Congress and are run as an independent government with the Mayor as its Chief Executive, a Vice-Mayor, City Council, one Congressional District and Representative per every 250,000 population count, a Police force, a common seal, and the power to take, purchase, receive, hold, lease, convey, and disposes of real and personal property for the general interests of the City, condemn private property for public use (eminent domain), contract and be contracted with, sue and exercise all the powers conferred to it by Congress.</p>
<p>The Local Government Code of 1991 reclassified all cities into one of three categories:</p>
<p><b>Highly Urbanized Cities</b> - Cities with a minimum population of two hundred thousand (200,000) inhabitants, as certified by the National Statistics Office, and with the latest annual income of at least Fifty Million Pesos (P50,000,000.00) based on 1991 constant prices, as certified by the city treasurer.</p>
<p><b>Independent Component Cities</b> -  Cities whose charters prohibit their voters from voting for provincial elective officials. Independent component cities shall be independent of the province.</p>
<p><b>Component Cities</b> - Cities which do not meet the above requirements shall be considered component cities of the province in which they are geographically located. If a component city is located within the boundaries of two (2) or more provinces, such city shall be considered a component of the province of which it used to be a municipality.</p>

<a id="Defunct/dissolved_cities" name="Defunct/dissolved_cities"></a><h3>Defunct/dissolved cities</h3>

<ul>
<li>Dagu-cala City (1947) - President Roxas issued <a class="externallink" href="http://www.dagupan.com/city/history5.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.dagupan.com/city/history5.htm">Executive Order No. 96</a> fixing the city limits of Dagupan to include the towns of <a href="/wiki/San_Fabian" id="w">San Fabian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Calasiao" id="w">Calasiao</a> but the residents of Calasiao rejected inclusion into the new city, causing controversy over the election that was held on Nov. 10, 1947. The Dagu-cala dispute was brought before the Supreme Court of the Philippines which subsequently validated the election and ruled that Dagupan became a city on June 20, 1947, when Roxas signed the charter into law.</li>
<li>Legazpi City (1948-1954) - Legazpi&#39;s cityhood was approved on June 18, 1948. Under <a class="externallink" href="http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno306.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno306.html">Republic Act 306</a>, Legazpi was to become a city after the President of the Philippines proclaimed its cityhood. Comprising the present-day territories of <a href="/wiki/Legazpi_City" id="w">Legazpi City</a> and <a href="/wiki/Daraga%2C_Albay" id="w">Daraga</a>, the city was <a class="externallink" href="http://www.angelfire.com/ar/Arimado/page2.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.angelfire.com/ar/Arimado/page2.html">dissolved on June 8, 1954</a> when Legazpi and Daraga were made into separate municipalities. Legazpi eventually became a city on its own on June 12, 1959.</li>
<li>Basilan City (1948-1973) - formerly part of the city of <a href="/wiki/Zamboanga_City" id="w">Zamboanga</a> until it was made a city on its own in 1948. Converted to the province of <a href="/wiki/Basilan" id="w">Basilan</a> in 1973 by President <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos" id="w">Ferdinand Marcos</a>. </li>
<li>Rajah Buayan City (1966) - under <a class="externallink" href="http://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1965/ra_4413_1965.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1965/ra_4413_1965.html">Republic Act 4413</a>, the then-municipality of General Santos in what was then the unified province of Cotabato was to be formally converted into a city named after Rajah Buayan (a former ruler in Mindanao) on January 1, 1966, provided that majority of qualified voters in the municipality vote in favor of cityhood in a plebiscite. In December 1965 the <a href="/wiki/Commission_on_Elections" id="w">Commission on Elections</a> (COMELEC) proclaimed the cityhood of Rajah Buayan, with 4,422 people voting for and 3,066 voting against. However, two residents of the new city challenged this by arguing in the courts that the number of people who voted in favor of cityhood did not form a majority in light of the fact that there were 15,727 voters in the city. The court issued an injunction on January 4, 1966 restraining city officers from performing any acts authorized by or pursuant to provisions in RA 4413. The <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Philippines" id="w">Supreme Court</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1966/oct1966/gr_l-25469_1966.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1966/oct1966/gr_l-25469_1966.html">unanimously upheld this decision on October 29, 1966</a> and declared that the city charter was not accepted by majority of voters, thus rendering RA4413 null and void. The municipality of General Santos would later be converted into a <a href="/wiki/General_Santos_City" id="w">city under the same name</a> in 1968.</li></ul>
