<p>Country musician <a href="/wiki/Willie_Nelson" id="w">Willie Nelson</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Cover_version" id="w">cover</a> (iTunes single <a href="/wiki/February_14" id="w">February 14</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>) is the first gay-themed <a href="/wiki/Mainstream_country" id="w">mainstream country</a> song by a major artist.<sup id="_ref-Tarradell_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tarradell" title="">[3]</a></sup> The song has been recorded and released by Sublette (GPS: <i>Life is a Killer</i> 1982), <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canadian</a> <a href="/wiki/Alternative_country" id="w">alternative country</a> band <a href="/wiki/Lost_Dakotas" id="w">Lost Dakotas</a> (Cargo: <i>Sun Machine</i>, 1992), and <a href="/wiki/Queercore" id="w">queercore</a> band <a href="/wiki/Pansy_Division" id="w">Pansy Division</a> (Lookout: <i>Pile Up</i> 1995).</p>
<a id="Sublette's_version" name="Sublette's_version"></a><h1>Sublette&#39;s version</h1>

<p>Sublette says the song is based on his experiences growing up in <a href="/wiki/Portales%2C_N.M." id="w">Portales, N.M.</a><sup id="_ref-365gay_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-365gay" title="">[4]</a></sup>: &#34;I sat down at the piano and … remembered what it felt like to feel different as a teenager, and the culture at that time, and I started to put those two things together and the song wrote itself&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Miami Herald_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Miami Herald" title="">[2]</a></sup> The song was written during the <i><a href="/wiki/Urban_Cowboy" id="w">Urban Cowboy</a></i> fad<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> while living with his wife in Manhattan next to a gay country bar on <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Street_(Manhattan)" id="w">Christopher Street</a> called Boots and Saddles. He explains, &#34;Gay life in 1981 was very vibrant in those days. It was part of the culture of the city and cowboy imagery is a part of gay iconography.&#34; He wrote the song with Nelson&#39;s voice in mind: &#34;I was at the beginning of my songwriting career … and used to like writing songs for my favorite voices. I&#39;ve been a Willie fan since the &#39;60s.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Miami Herald_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Miami Herald" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>As stated above, Sublette is acquainted with gay culture and the song is gay-friendly despite using what Ann Northrop of <a href="/wiki/Gay_USA" id="w">Gay USA</a> describes as, &#34;the language of thirty years ago.&#34;  For example, the lyrics, &#34;Well small town don&#39;t like it when somebody falls between sexes&#34; and, &#34;Well I believe in my soul that inside every man there&#39;s a feminine / And inside every lady there&#39;s a deep manly voice loud and clear&#34; display now marginal views about gender and sexuality (see <a href="/wiki/Havelock_Ellis" id="w">Havelock Ellis</a>&#39; <i>Sexual Inversion</i>). Other lyrics, however, maintain currency and say &#34;a lot about gender identity and heterosexual elitism&#34;<sup id="_ref-BAR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BAR" title="">[6]</a></sup>; for example, the lines, &#34;A cowboy may brag about things that he does with his women, / But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer&#34; suggest criticism of <a href="/wiki/The_closet" id="w">the closet</a> and small town bigotry. &#34;The song aims to show Mr. Nelson&#39;s support for gays, particularly to conservative country-music fans&#34; <sup id="_ref-Tarradell_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tarradell" title="">[3]</a></sup> and suggests that, in addition to other causes, he supports gay rights<sup id="_ref-Caballeros_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Caballeros" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The reception of Sublette&#39;s recording is hard to determine as the song was originally only available through the Dial-A-Poem, through which one could literally dial up a poem and listen on the phone. However, AllMusicGuide gave the album on which the song eventurally appeared 4½ out of 5 stars<sup id="_ref-AllMusic_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AllMusic" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

Nelson received a tape of the song from <a href="/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_Band" id="w">Saturday Night Live Band</a> bassist <a href="/wiki/Tony_Garnier_(musician)" id="w">Tony Garnier</a> after performing on the show<sup id="_ref-Time_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Time" title="">[8]</a></sup> in the mid to late 1980s and according to the latter, &#34;Willie took it from there&#34;<sup id="_ref-365gay_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-365gay" title="">[4]</a></sup> though Nelson recently found that demo in a drawer among a stack of his own while recording unreleased songs for iTunes at his Perdernales, Texas home studio.<sup id="_ref-Tarradell_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tarradell" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Reuters_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reuters" title="">[9]</a></sup> Nelson says, &#34;I thought it was the funniest goddamn song I&#39;d ever heard. I had it on the bus for 20 years, and people would come in and I&#39;d play it. When [<i><a href="/wiki/Brokeback_Mountain" id="w">Brokeback Mountain</a></i>] come out, it just seemed like a good time to kick it out of the closet&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Time_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Time" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are plans to release the song on a future album<sup id="_ref-CMT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CMT" title="">[10]</a></sup> and filming for the video featuring <a href="/wiki/Broken_Lizard" id="w">Broken Lizard Comedy Troupe</a><sup id="_ref-PRN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PRN" title="">[11]</a></sup> occurred at Dallas&#39; gay cowboy bar, the Round Up Saloon (in the predominantly gay <a href="/wiki/Oak_Lawn%2C_Dallas%2C_Texas" id="w">Oak Lawn</a> neighborhood of Dallas), in February. Nelson&#39;s publicist describes the release of the song, which debuted on <a href="/wiki/Howard_Stern" id="w">Howard Stern</a>&#39;s satellite radio show: &#34;Since everyone is talking about the acclaimed film <i><a href="/wiki/Brokeback_Mountain" id="w">Brokeback Mountain</a></i> and its Academy Award nominations, <a href="/wiki/Valentine%26%2339%3Bs_Day" id="w">Valentine&#39;s Day</a> seemed like the right time to let [the song] be heard.&#34; Nelson appeared on the movie&#39;s soundtrack with the traditional &#34;He Was A Friend Of Mine&#34;<sup id="_ref-365gay_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-365gay" title="">[4]</a></sup> which made the US charts at No. 54<sup id="_ref-BBC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC" title="">[12]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Nelson himself described the release in a prepared statement to Dallas Morning News<sup id="_ref-Reuters_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reuters" title="">[9]</a></sup>: &#34;The song&#39;s been in <a href="/wiki/The_closet" id="w">the closet</a> for 20 years. The timing&#39;s right for it to come out. I&#39;m just opening the door.&#34; The song&#39;s release was encouraged by the <a href="/wiki/Coming_out" id="w">coming out</a> of his friend and tour manager of thirty years, David Anderson, two years ago. Says Anderson: &#34;This song obviously has special meaning to me in more ways than one. I want people to know more than anything—gay, straight, whatever—just how cool Willie is and … his way of thinking, his tolerance, everything about him.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Tarradell_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tarradell" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h2>Reception</h2>
<p>Nelson&#39;s version of the song is his highest charting single since his 1984 duet with <a href="/wiki/Julio_Iglesias" id="w">Julio Iglesias</a> &#34;To All the Girls I&#39;ve Loved Before&#34; (No. 5)<sup id="_ref-Miami Herald_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Miami Herald" title="">[2]</a></sup>, debuting at No. 52 on the BillBoard Hot 100 chart, which Nelson last appeared on with the Toby Keith duet &#34;Beer for My Horses&#34;<sup id="_ref-Billboard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Billboard" title="">[13]</a></sup>. The song has also been well received by critics.  <a href="/wiki/Pitchfork_Media" id="w">Pitchfork Media</a>&#39;s Stephen M. Deusner rated the song four out of four stars despite calling it, &#34;even more of a stunt than his reggae album&#34; (2005&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Countryman" id="w">Countryman</a></i>). Saying that the song sounds written by Nelson, and that his performance raises the piece above the level of a cheap gag, he felt that it adds, &#34;a whole new level of complexity to the outlaw mythology Willie helped to cultivate in the 70s.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Pitchfork Media_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pitchfork Media" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nelson also says that he has received very few negative reactions: &#34;Every now and then somebody might get a little offended. It&#39;s got bad language in it, so I just don&#39;t do it in my shows. Anybody wants to hear it can hear it on iTunes. But you know people are listenin&#39; to it, likin&#39; it. Every now and then somebody don&#39;t like it, but that&#39;s okay. Similar to years ago, when the hippie thing come out and I started growin&#39; my hair and puttin&#39; the earring in, I got a little flak here and there.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Time_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Time" title="">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>However, some sources<sup id="_ref-365gay_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-365gay" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Tarradell_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tarradell" title="">[3]</a></sup>  speculate about the potential success and reception of the song. Nelson explains that he didn&#39;t think, &#34;it took a lot of balls to put the song out&#34; saying, &#34;first of all, I didn&#39;t think anybody would play it. I didn&#39;t think it would get on the air, but sure enough it did&#34; though not on country stations: &#34;Oh no, they&#39;re not gonna play it&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Time_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Time" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>WXBX, a country station in Johnson City, Tenn., devoted one morning show to a listener discussion of Nelson&#39;s release, concluding that, &#34;the audience was disappointed in these artists&#34; and, as Nelson thought, that they &#34;probably wouldn&#39;t be interested in much airplay&#34; <sup id="_ref-PlanetOut_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PlanetOut" title="">[15]</a></sup> PlanetOut explains that Nelson&#39;s fan base is secure and broad enough (including &#34;hippies, rednecks and outlaws young and old&#34;) to take risks with gay themed songs and soundtracks, while the WXBX station manager pointed out that Nelson has not been a mainstream country star for a while<sup id="_ref-PlanetOut_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PlanetOut" title="">[15]</a></sup>. Nelson&#39;s broad audience, and part of the appeal of the song, may be that, &#34;Willie speaks his mind about any subject ... That&#39;s one of those things that has made him so endearing to so many generations of fans&#34;<sup id="_ref-Caballeros_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Caballeros" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The song has been described variously as <a href="/wiki/Deadpan" id="w">deadpan</a>,<sup id="_ref-Tarradell_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tarradell" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-MSNBC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MSNBC" title="">[16]</a></sup> straight-faced,<sup id="_ref-Miami Herald_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Miami Herald" title="">[2]</a></sup> and  pointedly poignant.<sup id="_ref-Miami Herald_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Miami Herald" title="">[2]</a></sup> Sublette, as expected, approves of Nelson&#39;s performance and its potential impact, saying, &#34;It&#39;s supposed to be funny, that&#39;s what gets people&#39;s attention, but to get people to listen to it a second time [you] have to have something going on, and Willie beautifully brought out the tenderness there … [It&#39;s] nice to have a funny song out there—it is challenging people to laugh. Everybody is so angry now.&#34; Sublette speculated about the song&#39;s reception: &#34;Willie&#39;s smart. We talked about recording it in the &#39;90s but we needed some kind of context. It wouldn&#39;t make sense to just put this on some normal Willie album … The movie provided the context. I don&#39;t know if the public is any more or less ready than they were but I think the media is more ready.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Miami Herald_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Miami Herald" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The song was featured in a <a href="/wiki/Boondocks" id="w">Boondocks</a> comic strip on <a href="/wiki/February_27" id="w">February 27</a> and <a href="/wiki/February_28" id="w">February 28</a> (<a class="externallink" href="http://www.digisoul.com/boondocks/boondocks.asp?strip=02/27/2006" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.digisoul.com/boondocks/boondocks.asp?strip=02/27/2006">http://www.digisoul.com/boondocks/boondocks.asp?strip=02/27/2006</a>) and mentioned until <a href="/wiki/March_2" id="w">March 2</a>. According to Sublette, &#34;the Monday and Tuesday strip consisted of my lyrics and dramatizing listeners&#39; response to my lyrics. What a compliment!&#34;<sup id="_ref-Miami Herald_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Miami Herald" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The reception of Nelson&#39;s pro-gay song may be compared  to that of <a href="/wiki/Garth_Brooks" id="w">Garth Brooks</a>&#39; pro-peace 1992 <a href="/wiki/Single_(music)" id="w">single</a> &#34;<a href="/wiki/We_Shall_Be_Free" id="w">We Shall Be Free</a>&#34;. The song&#39;s single pro-gay line, &#34;when we&#39;re free to love anyone we choose&#34; caused some radio stations to refuse to play the song, contributing to its peak at No. 12 on Billboard&#39;s country singles chart and marking the end of Brooks&#39; string of top ten hits.<sup id="_ref-Tarradell_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tarradell" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
