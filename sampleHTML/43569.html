A <i>ghost town</i> is a town that has been abandoned, usually because the economic activity that supported it has failed or because of natural or human-caused disasters such as <a href="/wiki/War" id="w">war</a>.  The word is sometimes used in a deprecative sense to include areas where the current population is significantly less than it once was.  It may be a partial ghost town such as <a href="/wiki/Tonopah%2C_Nevada" id="w">Tonopah, Nevada</a> or a neighborhood where people no longer live (like <a href="/wiki/Love_Canal" id="w">Love Canal</a>). A tourist ghost town has significant economic activity from tourism, such as <a href="/wiki/Oatman%2C_Arizona" id="w">Oatman, Arizona</a>, or numerous sites in Egypt, but cannot sustain itself except by tourism.  A true ghost town is totally abandoned, such as <a href="/wiki/Bodie%2C_California" id="w">Bodie, California</a>, but often will see visitors.  A ghost town may be a site where little or nothing remains above the soil surface, e.g. <a href="/wiki/Babylon" id="w">Babylon</a>.  Often a ghost town will still have significant art and architecture, e.g. <a href="/wiki/Vijayanagara" id="w">Vijayanagara</a> in <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> or <a href="/wiki/Changan" id="w">Changan</a> in China. Most large countries and regions contain locations that can be considered ghost towns.</p>
<p>Some ghost towns are <a href="/wiki/Tourism" id="w">tourist</a> attractions, such as <a href="/wiki/Kolmanskop" id="w">Kolmanskop</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Bay_(Namibian_ghost_town)" id="w">Elizabeth Bay</a>, outside <a href="/wiki/L%C3%BCderitz" id="w">LÃ¼deritz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Namibia" id="w">Namibia</a>. This is especially true of those that preserve interesting architecture. Visiting, writing about, and photographing them is a minor industry.  Other ghost towns may be overgrown, difficult to access, dangerous or illegal to visit.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">As with many gold rush towns, the once thriving community of <a href="/wiki/Cassilis%2C_Victoria" id="w">Cassilis</a> is now abandoned</div></div>
</p> 
<p>Factors leading to abandonment of towns include depleted natural resources (as was the case of <a href="/wiki/Smeerenburg" id="w">Smeerenburg</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grytviken" id="w">Grytviken</a>), or natural resources such as water no longer being available, <a href="/wiki/Railway" id="w">railways</a> and <a href="/wiki/Motorway" id="w">motorways</a> bypassing or no longer accessing the town (as was the case in many of the ghost towns along Ontario&#39;s historic <a href="/wiki/Opeongo_Line" id="w">Opeongo Line</a>), shifting economic activity elsewhere, human intervention such as highway rerouting (as was the case with many towns located along U.S. <a href="/wiki/Route_66" id="w">route 66</a>, when motorists bypassed the towns on the faster moving <a href="/wiki/I-44" id="w">I-44</a> and <a href="/wiki/I-40" id="w">I-40</a>), river rerouting (the <a href="/wiki/Aral_Sea" id="w">Aral Sea</a> being one example of this), and nuclear disasters such as <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl" id="w">Chernobyl</a>. Significant fatality rates from <a href="/wiki/Epidemic" id="w">epidemics</a> have also produced ghost towns; for example, some places in eastern <a href="/wiki/Arkansas" id="w">Arkansas</a> were abandoned after near-total mortality (over 7,000 Arkansans died <a class="externallink" href="http://www.nwaonline.net/articles/2004/11/21/living/03flu1918.prt" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nwaonline.net/articles/2004/11/21/living/03flu1918.prt">http://www.nwaonline.net/articles/2004/11/21/living/03flu1918.prt</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Flu" id="w">Spanish Flu</a> epidemic of <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a> and <a href="/wiki/1919" id="w">1919</a>). The Middle East has many ghost towns, created when the shifting of politics or fall of empires caused capital cities to be socially or economically unviable, e.g., <a href="/wiki/Ctesiphon" id="w">Ctesiphon</a>.</p>
<p>Natural disasters can also create ghost towns.  After being flooded over 30 times since their town was founded in 1845, residents of <a href="/wiki/Pattonsburg%2C_Missouri" id="w">Pattonsburg, Missouri</a> had enough after two floods in 1993.  With government help, the whole town was rebuilt three miles away, now known as New Pattonsburg, leaving the old Pattonsburg behind as a ghost town.</p>
<p>Accidental land contamination can also create a ghost town.  This is what happened to <a href="/wiki/Times_Beach" id="w">Times Beach</a>, a suburb of <a href="/wiki/St._Louis" id="w">St. Louis</a>.</p>
<p>Ghost towns may also be created when land is <a href="/wiki/Eminent_domain" id="w">expropriated</a> by a government and everyone living there is told to leave, such as when <a href="/wiki/NASA" id="w">NASA</a> needed a <a href="/wiki/Rocket" id="w">rocket</a> propulsion testing center and built the <a href="/wiki/John_C._Stennis_Space_Center" id="w">John C. Stennis Space Center</a> in <a href="/wiki/Mississippi" id="w">Mississippi</a>, which required a very large (approximately 34 square miles) surrounding <a href="/wiki/Buffer_zone" id="w">buffer zone</a> because of the loud noise and potential dangers associated with testing huge rockets. This created abandoned communities and roads overgrown in the middle of the forest. There are also underwater ghost towns brought about by the building of <a href="/wiki/Dam" id="w">dams</a>. A good example of this would be the settlement of <a href="/wiki/Loyston%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Loyston, Tennessee</a>, which was inundated by the creation of <a href="/wiki/Norris_Lake%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Norris Lake</a>.  The settlement was reorganized and continues to exist today on nearby higher ground. <a href="/wiki/Centralia%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Centralia</a> in <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a> was abandoned due to a dangerous underground coal fire, but since some residents chose to stay despite the dangers, it cannot be classified as a true ghost town.</p>
<a id="Revived_ghost_towns" name="Revived_ghost_towns"></a><h1> Revived ghost towns </h1>
<p>A few ghost towns even manage a second life, often due to the tourism surrounding ghost towns of historic note propagating an economy able to support residents. <a href="/wiki/Walhalla%2C_Victoria" id="w">Walhalla</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, for example, was a town deserted after its gold mine ceased operation. Owing in part to its relative accessibility and partly to proximity to other attractive locations, Walhalla has had a recent surge in economy and population.</p>
<p>The second largest city of Egypt, <a href="/wiki/Alexandria" id="w">Alexandria</a> was a flourishing city in the Ancient era, but declined during the Middle Ages, qualifying as a ghost town in the 19th century with only 150 inhabitants. Only the Modern period has seen its growth into a city of 3.5 to 5 million inhabitants.</p>

<a id="Argentina" name="Argentina"></a><h4>Argentina</h4>
<p>Most European immigrants to <a href="/wiki/Argentina" id="w">Argentina</a> settled in the cities, which offered jobs, education, and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system. Since the 1930s, many rural workers have moved to the big cities.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/1990s" id="w">1990s</a> saw many rural towns become ghost towns when train services ceased and local products manufactured on a small scale were replaced by massive amounts of cheap imported goods.  Some ghost towns near cities offer touristic attractions, especially during weekends.</p>
<a id="Canada" name="Canada"></a><h4>Canada</h4>
<p>Ghost towns are seen in <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ontario" id="w">Northern Ontario</a>, <a href="/wiki/Central_Ontario" id="w">Central Ontario</a>, <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saskatchewan" id="w">Saskatchewan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador" id="w">Newfoundland and Labrador</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Outport" id="w">outport</a>) and in <a href="/wiki/Quebec" id="w">Quebec</a>. Some of these were logging towns or dual mining and logging sites, often <a href="/wiki/Company_town" id="w">developed at the behest of the company</a>. In British Columbia, they were predominantly mining towns and prospecting camps as well as canneries and, in one or two cases, large smelter and pulp mill towns.  </p>
<p>British Columbia has more ghost towns than any other jurisdiction on the North American continent, with one estimate at the number of abandoned and semi-abandoned towns and localities upwards of 1500.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Some ghost towns have revived their economies and populations due to historical and eco-tourism, such as <a href="/wiki/Barkerville" id="w">Barkerville</a>, once the largest town north of <a href="/wiki/Kamloops" id="w">Kamloops</a>, which is now a year-round Provincial Museum. </p>

<a id="Chile" name="Chile"></a><h4>Chile</h4>

<p>Most of the ghost towns in Chile have once been mining camps or lumber mills, such as the many <a href="/wiki/Potassium_nitrate" id="w">saltpeter</a> mining camps that prospered in from the end of the <a href="/wiki/Saltpeter_War" id="w">Saltpeter War</a> until the invention of <a href="/wiki/Synthetic_saltpeter" id="w">synthetic saltpeter</a> during the <a href="/wiki/First_World_War" id="w">First World War</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Port_Famine" id="w">Port Famine</a> (<a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" id="w">Spanish</a>: <i>Puerto Hambre</i>) is arguable Chile&#39;s oldest ghost town.

There are many ghost towns in the American <a href="/wiki/Great_Plains" id="w">Great Plains</a>, whose rural areas have lost a third of their population since <a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a>.  There are more than 6,000 abandoned sites of settlement in the state of <a href="/wiki/Kansas" id="w">Kansas</a> alone, according to Kansas historian <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Fitzgerald_(writer)" id="w">Daniel Fitzgerald</a>.{{Fact}}  Thousands of communities in the northern plains states like <a href="/wiki/North_Dakota" id="w">North Dakota</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_Dakota" id="w">South Dakota</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Montana" id="w">Montana</a> became railroad ghost towns when a rail-line failed to materialize.  Hundreds more were abandoned when the US Highway System replaced the railroads as America&#39;s favorite mode of travel.  Ghost towns are common in <a href="/wiki/Mining" id="w">mining</a> or old <a href="/wiki/Mill_town" id="w">mill town</a> areas: <a href="/wiki/Washington" id="w">Washington</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colorado" id="w">Colorado</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arizona" id="w">Arizona</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nevada" id="w">Nevada</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico" id="w">New Mexico</a>, <a href="/wiki/Montana" id="w">Montana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Minnesota" id="w">Minnesota</a>, and <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a> in the western <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia" id="w">West Virginia</a> in the eastern USA.

When the resources that had created an employment boom in these towns played out, eventually the businesses ceased to exist, and the people moved on to more productive areas. Sometimes a ghost town consists of many old abandoned buildings (like in <a href="/wiki/Bodie%2C_California" id="w">Bodie, California</a>), other times there are simply structures or foundations of former buildings (i.e., <a href="/wiki/Graysonia%2C_Arkansas" id="w">Graysonia, Arkansas</a>).

<p>Similar to the United States, Canada and other former frontier countries, most ghost towns in <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> were usually formed after the end of mining operations or the removal of railway services.

<a id="Europe" name="Europe"></a><h2>Europe</h2>
<p>In Europe, many <a href="/wiki/Village" id="w">villages</a> were abandoned over the ages, for many different reasons. Sometimes, wars and genocide end a town&#39;s life, and it is never resettled. This happened to the Swedish town <a href="/wiki/Sj%C3%B6stad" id="w">SjÃ¶stad</a>, in <a href="/wiki/N%C3%A4rke" id="w">NÃ¤rke</a>, in <a href="/wiki/1260" id="w">1260</a>, when the town&#39;s 700 merchants had crossed the ice of Lake <a href="/wiki/V%C3%A4ttern" id="w">VÃ¤ttern</a> and been cut down by the Danes. The Danes then proceeded to the town, ravaging and burning it. The town was never resettled. A farm named <i>Skyrstad</i>, ruins and a silver treasure which yielded 4000 coins are all that testify to its existence (see <a href="/wiki/Abandoned_village" id="w">abandoned village</a>). In the United Kingdom, the once thriving farming village of <a href="/wiki/Knaptoft" id="w">Knaptoft</a> in <a href="/wiki/Leicestershire" id="w">Leicestershire</a> was abandoned after it was razed by <a href="/wiki/Puritan" id="w">puritan</a> <a href="/wiki/Parliamentarian" id="w">parliamentarian</a> forces during the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" id="w">English Civil War</a> and was never resettled.

Natural disasters also play a role. For example, the erupting volcano of <a href="/wiki/Vesuvius" id="w">Vesuvius</a> famously terminated <a href="/wiki/Pompeii" id="w">Pompeii</a> and <a href="/wiki/Herculaneum" id="w">Herculaneum</a> in Italy in <a href="/wiki/Anno_Domini" id="w">AD</a> <a href="/wiki/79" id="w">79</a>.</p>
<p>This process continues to this day, with the village of <a href="/wiki/Etzweiler" id="w">Etzweiler</a> in northwestern <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> being abandoned in the <a href="/wiki/1990s" id="w">1990s</a> to make way for a <a href="/wiki/Coal" id="w">coal</a> mine <a class="externallink" href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~kazil/etzweiler.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.xs4all.nl/~kazil/etzweiler.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~kazil/etzweiler.html</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://diggelfjoer.swalker.nl/index.php?main=aband&#38;sub=abandetz" rel="nofollow" title="http://diggelfjoer.swalker.nl/index.php?main=aband&#38;sub=abandetz">http://diggelfjoer.swalker.nl/index.php?main=aband&#38;sub=abandetz</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Pyramiden" id="w">Pyramiden</a> (Swedish and Norwegian, meaning &#34;the pyramid&#34;, Russian: ÐÐ¸ÑÐ°Ð¼Ð¸Ð´Ð°) was a <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russian</a> settlement and coal mining community on the archipelago of <a href="/wiki/Svalbard" id="w">Svalbard</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norway" id="w">Norway</a>. It was founded by <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Sweden</a> in 1910, and sold to the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> in 1927. The settlement, with a one time population of 1,000 inhabitants, was abandoned in the late-1990s by its owner, the state-owned Soviet company Trust Artikugol, and is now a ghost town.
There are no restrictions on visiting Pyramiden. However, visitors may not enter any buildings without permission, even if the doors are open. Most buildings are now locked. Pyramiden is accessible by boat or snowmobile. Guided tours are available (in Russian, Norwegian, and English).</p>
<p>The city of <a href="/wiki/Pripyat%2C_Ukraine" id="w">Prypiat</a> and dozens of smaller settlements in northern <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" id="w">Ukraine</a> and southern <a href="/wiki/Belarus" id="w">Belarus</a> were abandoned after the <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl_accident" id="w">Chernobyl nuclear disaster</a> and turned into a closed <a href="/wiki/Zone_of_alienation" id="w">alienation zone</a>. The area has been largely untouched since then, and as such it functions as a large <a href="/wiki/Time_capsule" id="w">time capsule</a> of the late <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet</a> era.  There is an <a class="externallink" href="http://www.kiddofspeed.com/chapter1.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.kiddofspeed.com/chapter1.html">online photojournal</a> of this area.</p>
<p>Several Ghost towns were created in <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a> in the latter half of the nineteenth century, particularly in the west of the country, due to a combination of the <a href="/wiki/Potato_famine" id="w">potato famine</a> and economic decline brought on by the famine. These now consist primarily of knee high ruins of cottages. Notable ghost towns are on <a href="/wiki/Achill_Island" id="w">Achill Island</a> and in the <a href="/wiki/Burren" id="w">Burren</a> area of county Clare. A more recent ghost town was created in the 1950s on <a href="/wiki/Great_Blasket" id="w">Great Blasket</a> island, where island life became unfeasible and the island was depopulated. The Island is only accessible to tourists in the summer months.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Ãle_aux_Marins" id="w">Ãle aux Marins</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Saint-Pierre_and_Miquelon" id="w">Saint-Pierre and Miquelon</a> groups of islands.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Finland" id="w">Finland</a>, which is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world, most people live in the biggest towns, and some villages near the Russian border and in <a href="/wiki/Lapland_Province" id="w">Lapland</a> are nearly abandoned.</p>
<p>While <a href="/wiki/Athens" id="w">Athens</a>, Greece, experienced severe decline after the end of the Byzantine Empire, it may never have been a ghost town, although it certainly came close, dwindling to some 3,000 or 4,000 people by the <a href="/wiki/19th_century" id="w">19th century</a>. It has since gone back to being a major city. <a href="/wiki/Rome" id="w">Rome</a> experienced similar declines, but it, too, hasn&#39;t been completely abandoned (one of its lowest estimated populations was 17,000 in <a href="/wiki/1347" id="w">1347</a>, down from more than a million in Imperial times {{Fact}}).</p>
<a id="Hungary" name="Hungary"></a><h4>Hungary</h4>
<p>Hundreds of villages were abandoned during the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman" id="w">Ottoman</a> wars in the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary" id="w">Kingdom of Hungary</a> in the 16-17th century. Many of them were never repopulated but generally they are not classified as ghost towns because few visible traces remained of them. Real ghost towns are rare in present-day <a href="/wiki/Hungary" id="w">Hungary</a>, except the abandoned villages of <a href="/wiki/Derenk" id="w">Derenk</a> (left in 1943) and <a href="/wiki/Nagyg%C3%A9c" id="w">NagygÃ©c</a> (left in 1970). Due to the decrease of rural population beginning in the 1980s dozens of villages are now threatened with abandonment. The first village officially declared as &#34;died out&#34; was <a href="/wiki/Gy%C5%B1r%C5%B1f%C5%B1" id="w">GyÅ±rÅ±fÅ±</a> in the end of the 1970s but later it was repopulated as an eco-village. Sometimes depopulated villages were successfully saved as small rural resorts like <a href="/wiki/K%C3%A1n%2C_Hungary" id="w">KÃ¡n</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tornak%C3%A1polna" id="w">TornakÃ¡polna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Szanticska" id="w">Szanticska</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gorica%2C_Hungary" id="w">Gorica</a> and <a href="/wiki/R%C3%A9vfalu" id="w">RÃ©vfalu</a>.</p>
<a id="Bulgaria" name="Bulgaria"></a><h4>Bulgaria</h4>
<p>An increasing number of settlements in <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria" id="w">Bulgaria</a> are becoming ghost towns as a result of the ongoing demographic decline of that country since the late <a href="/wiki/20th_century" id="w">20th century</a>.  According to the <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a> <a href="/wiki/Census" id="w">census</a> there were 138 uninhabited villages, estimated to have become over 150 by <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>.  There are such ghost villages in 16 out of the 28 provinces of the country, more numerous in <a href="/wiki/Gabrovo_Province" id="w">Gabrovo Province</a> (57 in <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>), <a href="/wiki/Veliko_Tarnovo_Province" id="w">Veliko Tarnovo Province</a> (34), <a href="/wiki/Kardzhali_Province" id="w">Kardzhali</a>, <a href="/wiki/Blagoevgrad_Province" id="w">Blagoebgrad</a>, <a href="/wiki/Burgas_Province" id="w">Burgas</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lovech_Province" id="w">Lovech</a> Provinces.  Some Bulgarian villages may avoid that fate thanks to immigration of settlers from abroad, mainly from the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> but also other <a href="/wiki/EU" id="w">EU</a> countries, former <a href="/wiki/USSR" id="w">Soviet</a> republics, even <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> etc.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Pripyat%2C_Ukraine" id="w"> Pripyat</a> is one of the biggest ghost towns today because at its peak, it had a population of over 50 thousand residents and all of them have completely abandoned the town after the <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster" id="w">Chernobyl disaster</a>.
