<p>In addition to its namesake brand, American Eagle, the company has developed and announced plans for several new brand and concept initiatives poised to drive new growth as the American Eagle brand nears saturation in current markets. One already launched brand being Aerie. </p>
<p>The company&#39;s second stand-alone lifestyle concept, <a href="/wiki/Martin_%2B_Osa" id="w">Martin + Osa</a>, launched in the fall of 2006, targets men and women 25 to 40 years of age. </p>
<p>The company has also indicated that a third lifestyle concept is in development that analysts speculate could be aimed at <a href="/wiki/Baby_Boomers" id="w">Baby Boomers</a> (Born during 1945–65 period), and may offer homewares.</p>
<p>In the year <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>, the company acquired a <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>-based retail concept called <a href="/wiki/Bluenotes" id="w">Bluenotes</a>, which has approximately 100 stores averaging 3,300 square feet. The concept targeted a slightly younger demographic, ages 12-22, and was positioned as a denim-driven urban/suburban lifestyle brand. Due largely to poor performance, the Bluenotes business was sold to YM Inc. in <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>.</p>

On the 2007 second quarter conference call<a class="externallink" href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/45199-american-eagle-outfitters-f2q07-qtr-end-8-4-07-earnings-call-transcript" rel="nofollow" title="http://seekingalpha.com/article/45199-american-eagle-outfitters-f2q07-qtr-end-8-4-07-earnings-call-transcript">http://seekingalpha.com/article/45199-american-eagle-outfitters-f2q07-qtr-end-8-4-07-earnings-call-transcript</a>, CEO James O&#39;Donnell clarified the American Eagle&#39;s relationship with NLS and its effect on business. He explained, &#34;We owned NLS with the acquisition of Braemar back in 2000 and we subsequently sold off NLS in 2006, and we are currently a customer of NLS... We have really no involvement at all with Unite Here and NLS. Our only involvement with NLS is basically as a customer and there have been some allegations made I think to some of, to the public about it affecting our business. I can tell you right now it has not affected our business.&#34;</p>
