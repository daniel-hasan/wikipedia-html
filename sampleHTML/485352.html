<p>The <b><i>Audacious</i></b><b> class aircraft carriers</b> were a class of ship proposed by the <a href="/wiki/British_government" id="w">British government</a> in the <a href="/wiki/1930s" id="w">1930s</a> - <a href="/wiki/1940s" id="w">1940s</a>. The <i>Audacious</i> class was originally designed as an expansion of the <a href="/wiki/Implacable_class_aircraft_carrier" id="w">&#39;&#39;Implacable&#39;&#39; class</a> with double storied hangars. However, it was realised that the hangar height would not be sufficient for the new aircraft that were expected to enter service, so the design was considerably enlarged.</p> 
<p>Four ships of were laid down between 1942 and 1943 during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> as part of the British <a href="/wiki/Navy" id="w">naval</a> buildup - HMS <i>Africa</i> (D06), HMS <i>Ark Royal</i> (91), HMS <i>Audacious</i> (D29) and HMS <i>Eagle</i> (94). At the end of hostilities <i>Africa</i> and <i>Eagle</i>  were cancelled. Work on the remaining two was suspended. </p>
