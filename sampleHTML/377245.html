The <b>red imported fire ants</b>(<i>Solenopsis invicta</i>), or simply <b>RIFA</b>, is one of over 280 members of the widespread <a href="/wiki/Genus" id="w">genus</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Fire_ant" id="w">Solenopsis</a></i>. Although the red imported fire ant is native to <a href="/wiki/South_America" id="w">South America</a>, it is best known in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" id="w">Taiwan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippines</a>, and the southern <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Republic_of_China" id="w">Chinese</a> province of <a href="/wiki/Guangdong" id="w">Guangdong</a>. In January 2005, several <a href="/wiki/Ant-hill" id="w">ant-hills</a> belonging to fire ants were found in northern <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a>. Later, after a thorough search for the ant was conducted there, several hundred ant-hills were found in different parts of Hong Kong. There were also reports of ant hills in <a href="/wiki/Macau" id="w">Macau</a>, the former Portuguese enclave that borders the province of Guangdong. They have recently been introduced in the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippines</a> in July 2005 when an infested cargo plane coming from <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a> (via <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>) arrived in <a href="/wiki/Manila" id="w">Manila</a>.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Colonies were accidentally introduced into the United States in the 1930s through the seaport of <a href="/wiki/Mobile%2C_Alabama" id="w">Mobile, Alabama</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Cargo ships from Brazil docking at Mobile unloaded goods infested with the ants; they have since spread from Alabama to the coastal plain and piedmont of almost all of the southeastern states, as well as into California. The ants were accidentally introduced into Australia in 2001, in a similar way<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a><h1>Overview</h1>
<p>RIFA are more aggressive than most native ant species and have a painful sting. A person typically encounters them by inadvertently stepping into one of their mounds, which causes the ants to swarm up the person&#39;s legs, attacking <i>en masse.</i> The ants respond to <a href="/wiki/Pheromone" id="w">pheromones</a> that are released by the first ant to attack. The ants then swarm and immediately sting when any movement is sensed.</p>

<p>RIFA are efficient competitors to other ants, and have been successful at enlarging their range, notably in the United States, where they have gradually spread north and west despite intense efforts to stop them. Today they are found in most of the southeastern states, including <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oklahoma" id="w">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arkansas" id="w">Arkansas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mississippi" id="w">Mississippi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alabama" id="w">Alabama</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tennessee" id="w">Tennessee</a>, <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)" id="w">Georgia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina" id="w">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maryland" id="w">Maryland</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a>. It is not uncommon for several fire ant mounds to appear suddenly in a suburban yard or a farmer&#39;s field, seemingly overnight. Even in the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco%2C_California" id="w">San Francisco, California</a>, area, there are large numbers of red imported fire ants.  (At least one community uses the presence of fire ants as a publicity opportunity: <a href="/wiki/Marshall%2C_Texas" id="w">Marshall, Texas</a>, hosts an annual <a class="externallink" href="http://www.marshall-chamber.com/pages/fireants.php" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.marshall-chamber.com/pages/fireants.php">fire ant festival</a>.)

RIFA are still on the move, often traveling from one area to another in turf, root balls of nursery plants, and other agricultural products. They are a pest, not only because of the physical pain they can inflict, but because their mound-building activity can damage plant roots and lead to loss of crops. Their stings are rarely life-threatening to humans and other large animals, causing only 80 documented deaths as of 2006. They often kill smaller animals such as birds. They sometimes kill newborn calves if the calves do not get on their feet quickly enough. The sting of the RIFA has venom composed of a <a href="/wiki/Necrosis" id="w">necrotizing</a> <a href="/wiki/Alkaloid" id="w">alkaloid</a> which causes both pain and the formation of white pustules which appear one day after the sting. </p>
<p>Red imported fire ants are extremely resilient and have adaptations to contend with both flooding and drought conditions. If the ants sense increased water levels in their nests, they will come together and form a huge ball or raft that is able to float on the water, with the workers on the outside and the queen inside. Once the ball hits a tree or other stationary object, the ants swarm onto it and wait for the water levels to recede. To contend with drought conditions, their nest structure includes a network of underground foraging tunnels that extends down to the water table. Also, despite the fact that they do not hibernate during the winter, colonies can survive cold conditions as low as 16 <a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit" id="w">°F</a> (−9 <a href="/wiki/Celsius" id="w">°C</a>).</p>
<p>At present, RIFA in the United States can be controlled but not eradicated. A number of products are available, which can be used on a mound-by-mound basis to destroy ant colonies when they appear. With all such efforts, it is important to reach and kill the queens, which may be as far as six <a href="/wiki/Foot_(unit_of_length)" id="w">feet</a> (2&#160;<a href="/wiki/Metre" id="w">m</a>) underground; otherwise, some queens may simply move a short distance away and quickly re-establish the colony.</p>
<a id="Body_structure" name="Body_structure"></a><h1>Body structure</h1>
<p>Fire ants are <a href="/wiki/Bilateral_symmetry" id="w">bilaterally symmetrical</a>. They have hardened <a href="/wiki/Exoskeleton" id="w">exoskeletons</a>, a tough <a href="/wiki/Integument" id="w">integument</a> for support and protection. They breathe through <a href="/wiki/Invertebrate_trachea" id="w">tracheae</a>, like other terrestrial insects. </p>
<p>Their bodies, like their relatives&#39; (the <a href="/wiki/Bee" id="w">bees</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wasp" id="w">wasps</a>), are divided into three major parts: <a href="/wiki/Head_(anatomy)" id="w">head</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mesosoma" id="w">mesosoma</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Metasoma" id="w">metasoma</a>. They have three pairs of legs, and a pair of elbowed <a href="/wiki/Antenna_(biology)" id="w">antennae</a>. The distinguishing characteristics of the Family Formicidae (the ants) are the presence of a pedicel or hump between the thorax and the gaster or abdomen of the insect. The Formicidae also have geniculate or elbowed antennae.</p>
<p>Red imported fire ants are further distinguished from the other ants by the presence of both a pedicel and postpediole.  In other words they belong to a group of ants that have two humps between the thorax and abdomen.  The workers have ten antennal segments terminating in a two segmented club.  It is often difficult to distinguish between the red imported fire ant <i>Solenopsis invicta</i> and the other species in the genus. A number of characters are used, but are not always consistent between the black imported fire ant (<i>Solenopsis richteri</i>)or hybrids between the two species. Positive identifications can be made using <a href="/wiki/High_performance_liquid_chromatography" id="w">high performance liquid chromatography</a> (HPLC) to distinguish differences in the cuticular hydrocarbons.  </p>
<p>As in other ants, the worker and soldier ants are sterile females. The queen is responsible for laying thousands of eggs. The number of males is low because they are only produced during a brief period of the year when mating swarms are emerging.</p>
<p>Contrary to what most people believe, a fire ant does not just “bite.” They use their jaws to anchor themselves and then, like a bee or wasp, inject <a href="/wiki/Venom" id="w">venom</a> using a sting at the tip of their abdomen. Using their strong mandibles to attach themselves to the victim’s flesh, they can sting many times continuously. They are extremely aggressive and have the ability to deliver venom in unison.</p>

The RIFA&#39;s introduction to the US was in the late 1930&#39;s. Travelling in the soil used as ballast on cargo ships, they came in through port Mobile, Alabama. Since then, the RIFA population has increased its territorial range to include most of the <a href="/wiki/Southern_United_States" id="w">Southern United States</a>, and now parts of the <a href="/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States" id="w">East Coast</a> and <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>. They build mounds, usually no larger than 46&#160;<a href="/wiki/Centimetre" id="w">cm</a> (18&#160;<a href="/wiki/Inch" id="w">in</a>) in diameter and 46&#160;cm (18&#160;in) in height, although in Alabama some mounds have been reported to be over two feet high (24&#160;in) and larger, especially in fields where cattle graze, they build on soil close to homes and other buildings, and sometimes forage indoors for food and moisture. They are a nuisance and can threaten sleeping or bedridden individuals, and pets. Occasionally they feed on vegetable plants in home gardens. The worst damage usually occurs during hot, dry weather when they invade flowerbeds while seeking warmth and moisture. If disturbed, fire ants bite and sting the intruder. </p>
<p>They are somehow attracted to electrical equipment and crawl into air conditioning units and the <a href="/wiki/Electrical_wiring" id="w">electrical wiring</a> of stoplights, shorting them out. This is the leading cause of traffic light shorts in <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a>, where the ants cause more than US$140 million in damage each year. Several ant species, including fire ants, have been shown to contain ferromagnetic nanoparticles that may contribute information about the geomagnetic field for orientation during foraging or migration.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> However, it has not been found that electric or magnetic fields attract the ants.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Rather, when wandering ants cause electrical shorts, they attempt to sting the wire and produce powerful <a href="/wiki/Semiochemical" id="w">semiochemicals</a>, including defensive and recruitment <a href="/wiki/Pheromone" id="w">pheromones</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The chemical signals draw additional ants to the short.  The only effective protection is to bar ants from the equipment physically or with insecticides.</p>
<p>The FDA estimates that more than US$5 billion is spent annually on medical treatment, damage, and control in RIFA-infested areas. Further, the ants cause approximately US$750 million in damage to agricultural assets, including vet bills and livestock loss as well as crop loss.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fire ants are excellent natural predators and are biological controls for pests such as the <a href="/wiki/Sugarcane_borer" id="w">sugarcane borer</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Rice_stink_bug" id="w">rice stink bug</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Striped_earwig" id="w">striped earwig</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aphid" id="w">aphids</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Boll_weevil" id="w">boll weevil</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Soybean_looper" id="w">soybean looper</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Cotton_leafworm" id="w">cotton leafworm</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Hornfly" id="w">hornfly</a>, and many other pests harmful to crops. However, they also kill beneficial <a href="/wiki/Pollinator" id="w">pollinators</a> such as ground-nesting <a href="/wiki/Bee" id="w">bee</a> species. Seeds, fruits, leaves, roots, bark, nectar, sap, fungi, and carrion are all fire-ant prey, and they are not shy from creating their own <a href="/wiki/Carrion" id="w">carrion</a> either. They are proficient enough at overwhelming intruders that they can virtually clear an area of invertebrates, lizards, and ground-dwelling birds.</p>
<p>Since September 2004, <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" id="w">Taiwan</a> has been seriously affected by the red fire ant. A few people are reported to have succumbed to venom from the ant stings. A large campaign to kill the ants has been partially effective, but it has not been able to eliminate all of them. </p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Republic_of_China" id="w">China</a> in January 2005, a controversy arose when it became known that <a href="/wiki/Guangdong" id="w">Guangdong</a>&#39;s provincial government had suppressed all information about the spread of fire ants in the province since the middle of 2004. <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a> newspapers, including <i>Appledaily</i>, <i>Mingpao</i>, <i>Hong Kong Economic Times</i>, <i>Singtao</i> and <i>Takungpao</i> (the latter funded by the Chinese government), have also reported that the ants have been found in both <a href="/wiki/Shenzhen" id="w">Shenzhen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wuchuan" id="w">Wuchuan</a> in <a href="/wiki/Guangdong_province" id="w">Guangdong province</a>. </p>
<p>According to a press briefing of the <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" id="w">Agriculture</a>, Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong, the city authorities have also located several <a href="/wiki/Ant-hill" id="w">ant-hills</a> of <i>Solenopsis invicta</i> in an artificial <a href="/wiki/Wetland" id="w">wetland</a> in Hong Kong&#39;s northwestern section. </p>
<p>There have also been reports of ant-hills in <a href="/wiki/Metro_Manila" id="w">Metro Manila</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cavite" id="w">the Province of Cavite</a> in the Philippines since July 2005, however since early 2007 they have spread now as far as the <a href="/wiki/Bicol_Region" id="w">Bicol Region</a>. </p>
<p>An outbreak of RIFA in <a href="/wiki/Queensland" id="w">Queensland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, was discovered on <a href="/wiki/22_February" id="w">22 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>. It is believed that the ants were present in shipping containers arriving at the Port of Brisbane from the United States. Anecdotal evidence suggests fire ants may have been present in Australia for six to eight years prior to formal identification. While the outbreak is restricted to a small (800 km²) region of southeast Queensland in and around Brisbane, the potential social, economic, and ecological damage prompted the Australian government to respond rapidly. The initial emergency response was followed by the formation of the Fire Ant Control Centre in September 2001. Joint state and federal funding of <a href="/wiki/Australian_dollar" id="w">A$175</a>,000,000 was granted for a 6-year eradication program involving the employment of more than 600 staff and the broad-scale baiting of approximately 678.9&#160;km² between 8 and 12 times, followed by two years of surveillance. Following the completion of the fourth year of the eradication program, the Fire Ant Control Centre estimated eradication rates of greater than 99% from previously infested properties. The latest (May 8) Federal budget confirmed that the Program will receive extended Commonwealth funding of approximately $A10m for at least another two years until June 2009 to treat the residual infestations found most recently and to fund validation of the overall treatment and surveillance Program. (see: <a class="externallink" href="http://www.maff.gov.au/releases/07B010.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.maff.gov.au/releases/07B010.html">http://www.maff.gov.au/releases/07B010.html</a>) As in previous years the States have agreed in principle to match the Federal funding. That decision is set to be ratified in June 2007.</p>
<a id="Countermeasures" name="Countermeasures"></a><h1>Countermeasures</h1>
<p>Red imported fire ants have virtually no natural <a href="/wiki/Biological_pest_control" id="w">biological control agents</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Republic_of_China" id="w">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippines</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>. Many scientists and agencies are attempting to develop methods to stop the spread of the RIFA.</p>
<a id="Biological_methods" name="Biological_methods"></a><h2>Biological methods</h2>
<p>Traditionally, control of RIFA has been achieved through <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" id="w">pesticide</a> use, but current research is introducing natural enemies of the ant. The microsporidian <a href="/wiki/Protozoa" id="w">protozoan</a> <i>Thelohania solenopsae</i> and the <a href="/wiki/Fungus" id="w">fungus</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Beauveria_bassiana" id="w">Beauveria bassiana</a></i> are promising <a href="/wiki/Pathogen" id="w">pathogens</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/Solenopsis_daguerrei" id="w">Solenopsis daguerrei</a></i>, a parasitic ant, invades RIFA colonies to replace the queen in hopes of gaining control of the colony. For this reason, its use as a biological control agent is also being explored. Also a simple introduction to an <a href="/wiki/Anteater" id="w">anteater</a> may also help, but it is currently being dismissed   because the anteater is currently <a href="/wiki/Endangered_species" id="w">endangered</a>. </p>
<p><i>Pseudacteon tricuspis</i> and <i>Pseudacteon curvatus</i> are <a href="/wiki/Parasite" id="w">parasitoid</a> <a href="/wiki/Phorid_fly" id="w">phorid flies</a> from <a href="/wiki/South_America" id="w">South America</a> which parasitize the ants. The female flies each lay an egg at the junction of head and thorax of their victims, prompting a jerky dance maneuver by the ants. The larva then slowly consumes the contents of the head, decapitating the ant in the process, and using the exoskeleton as a pupal case.</p>
<p>Phorid flies have been introduced in many places in southeastern United States, and are slowly reproducing and spreading to cover the entire RIFA range. The amount of actual damage done by phorid flies is minimal, but the ants appear to be aware of the hovering flies, losing their social organization and ceasing foraging, thus causing much greater damage in the long run. In addition, phorid flies are very species-specific, and should in theory leave native ant species (the fire ants&#39; prime competitor) unmolested.</p>
<p>A virus, SINV-1<sup id="_ref-valles2004_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-valles2004" title="">[7]</a></sup>, has been found in about 20 percent of fire ant fields, where it appears to cause the slow death of infected colonies.  It has proven to be self-sustaining and transmissible.  Once introduced, it can eliminate a colony within three months.  Researchers<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> believe the virus has potential as a viable biopesticide to control fire ants<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In some cases, hastily adopted biological control agents can do more harm than good (such as the <a href="/wiki/Mosquitofish" id="w">mosquitofish</a> in Australia), and it remains to be seen how much success biological control of the red imported fire ant will have.</p>
<a id="Physical_methods" name="Physical_methods"></a><h2>Physical methods</h2>
<p>Researchers have also been experimenting with extreme temperature change to exterminate RIFA, such as injecting <a href="/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen" id="w">liquid nitrogen</a> or pressurized steam into RIFA nests.  Folk remedies have often sought a rapid <i>increase</i> in temperature by soaking the nest in <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" id="w">gasoline</a> or <a href="/wiki/Kerosene" id="w">kerosene</a> and lighting it on fire, but this is potentially dangerous and should not be attempted.  Further, the burning of the nest is ineffective as the soil acts as a heat shield.  The confusion stems from the observed fact that fuel vapor has a near instantaneous lethal effect on the ants and that in the time it takes to pour fuel, set the source away, and then light the mound, the vapors have spread throughout the tunnels and killed the bulk of the mound.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Brisbane%2C_Australia" id="w">Brisbane, Australia</a>, colonies are being eradicated or effectively controlled by ground baiting with food laced with <a href="/wiki/Contraceptive" id="w">contraceptives</a> (that render the colony&#39;s Queen infertile) and <a href="/wiki/Toxicant" id="w">toxicants</a>. Mass baiting was undertaken following detection of the ants around the port of Brisbane and in south western Brisbane in 2001. Widespread public reporting of suspect colonies (by sending in samples of ants for identification) allowed mapping of the ant&#39;s locations. This was combined with <a href="/wiki/Satellite_imagery" id="w">satellite imagery</a> to determine the vegetated <a href="/wiki/Habitats" id="w">habitats</a> most likely to be infiltrated by the ants and the baits were targeted in these areas. Known infested areas were declared high-risk (Restricted Areas), and any material being moved from these areas which could harbour ants (soil, mulch, potted plants, potting mix, hay bales, construction machinery etc) had to be inspected prior to disposal or movement and bulk waste sent to transfer stations for examination, treatment and disposal. The infestation was initially thought to cover 270 km² with a density of up to 600,000 colonies/km² on highly infested sites. As Program activity refined data on the infested area, overall size grew to around 80,000ha by 2006/7. At mid-2007 in the on-going nationally-funded eradication campaign, fewer than 100 active colonies were located in the entire <a href="/wiki/South-East_Queensland" id="w">South-East Queensland</a> area during the 6 months between September 2006 and February 2007. The focus of delivering eradication has now switched largely to surveillance, while control and validation measures are expected to continue until 2009. The six year eradication campaign has cost A$175 million to date and has just secured funding in principle for a minimum of two more years.
