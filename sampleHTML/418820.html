<b>The Turk</b> was a <a href="/wiki/Chess" id="w">chess</a>-playing <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" id="w">machine</a> of the late 18th century, promoted as an <a href="/wiki/Automaton" id="w">automaton</a> but later proved to be a <a href="/wiki/Hoax" id="w">hoax</a>.  Constructed and unveiled in 1770 by the <a href="/wiki/Austria-Hungary" id="w">Austrian-Hungarian</a> <a href="/wiki/Wolfgang_von_Kempelen" id="w">Wolfgang von Kempelen</a> (1734–1804) to impress the Empress <a href="/wiki/Maria_Theresa_of_Austria" id="w">Maria Theresa</a>, the mechanism appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent, as well as perform the <a href="/wiki/Knight%26%2339%3Bs_tour" id="w">knight&#39;s tour</a>, a puzzle that requires the player to move a <a href="/wiki/Knight_(chess)" id="w">knight</a> to occupy every square of a <a href="/wiki/Chessboard" id="w">chessboard</a> once and only once.</p>
<p>Publicly promoted as an automaton and given its common name based on its appearance, the Turk was in fact a mechanical <a href="/wiki/Magic_(illusion)" id="w">illusion</a> that allowed a human chess master to hide inside and operate the machine. With a skilled operator, the Turk won most of the games played. The apparatus was demonstrated around <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> and the Americas for over 80 years until its destruction by fire in 1854, playing and defeating many challengers including statesmen such as <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France" id="w">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> and <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin" id="w">Benjamin Franklin</a>.</p>

Kempelen was inspired to build The Turk following his attendance at the court of Maria Theresa of Austria at <a href="/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nbrunn_Palace" id="w">Schönbrunn Palace</a>, where <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Pelletier" id="w">François Pelletier</a> was performing an illusion act.

Placed on the top of the cabinet was a chessboard, which measured eighteen inches (50&#160;cm) square. The front of the cabinet consisted of three doors, an opening, and a drawer, which could be opened to reveal a red and white <a href="/wiki/Ivory" id="w">ivory</a> chess set.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">An illustration of the workings of the model. The various parts were directed by a human via interior levers and machinery. As noted above, the illustration reflects a distorted measurement.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></div> interior of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it.<sup id="_ref-Anomalies_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anomalies" title="">[1]</a></sup> When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to <a href="/wiki/Clockwork" id="w">clockwork</a>. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open at the same time one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as <a href="/wiki/Brass" id="w">brass</a> structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Turkish model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Neither the clockwork visible to the left side of the machine nor the drawer that housed the chess set extended fully to the rear of the cabinet; they instead went only one third of the way. A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the director inside to slide from place to place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding of the seat caused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further conceal the person inside the cabinet.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The chessboard on the top of the cabinet was thin enough to allow for a <a href="/wiki/Magnet" id="w">magnetic</a> linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the director inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the director to see which places on the board were affected by a player&#39;s move.<sup id="_ref-AH_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AH" title="">[12]</a></sup> The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a further means of misdirection, the Turk came with a small wooden coffin-like box that the presenter would place on the top of the cabinet.<sup id="_ref-Anomalies_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anomalies" title="">[1]</a></sup> While <a href="/wiki/Johann_Nepomuk_M%C3%A4lzel" id="w">Johann Nepomuk Mälzel</a>, a later owner of the machine, did not use the box,<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Kempelen often peered into the box during play, suggesting that the box controlled some aspect of the machine.<sup id="_ref-Anomalies_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anomalies" title="">[1]</a></sup> The box was believed by some to have supernatural power, with Karl Gottlieb von Windisch writing in his 1784 book <i>Inanimate Reason</i> that &#34;[o]ne old lady, in particular, who had not forgotten the tales she had been told in her youth … went and hid herself in a window seat, as distant as she could from the <i>evil spirit,</i> which she firmly believed <a href="/wiki/Spiritual_possession" id="w">possessed</a> the machine.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Windisch_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Windisch" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">A cross-section of the Turk from Racknitz, showing how he thought the director sat inside as he played his opponent. Racknitz was wrong both about the position of the director and the dimensions of the automaton.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></div> interior also contained a <a href="/wiki/Perforated_hardboard" id="w">pegboard</a> chess board connected to a <a href="/wiki/Pantograph" id="w">pantograph</a>-style series of levers that controlled the model&#39;s left arm. The metal pointer on the pantograph moved over the interior chessboard, and would simultaneously move the arm of the Turk over the chessboard on the cabinet. The range of motion allowed the director to move the Turk&#39;s arm up and down, and turning the lever would open and close the Turk&#39;s hand, allowing it to grasp the pieces on the board. All of this was made visible to the director by using a simple <a href="/wiki/Candle" id="w">candle</a>, which had a ventilation system through the model.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Other parts of the machinery allowed for a clockwork-type sound to be played when the Turk made a move, further adding to the machinery illusion, and for the Turk to make various facial expressions.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> A <a href="/wiki/Speech_synthesis#History" id="w">voice box</a> was added following the Turk&#39;s acquisition by Mälzel, allowing the machine to say &#34;Échec!&#34; (<a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a> for &#34;<a href="/wiki/Check_(board_game)" id="w">check</a>&#34;) during matches.<sup id="_ref-Poe_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Poe" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>An operator inside the machine also had tools to assist in communicating with the presenter outside. Two brass discs equipped with numbers were positioned opposite each other on the inside and outside of the cabinet. A rod could rotate the discs to the desired number, which acted as a code between the two.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Exhibition" name="Exhibition"></a><h2>Exhibition</h2>
<p>The Turk made its debut in 1770 at Schönbrunn Palace, about six months after Pelletier&#39;s act. Kempelen addressed the court, presenting what he had built, and began the demonstration of the machine and its parts. With every showing of the Turk, Kempelen began by opening the doors and drawers of the cabinet, allowing members of the audience to inspect the machine. Following this display, Kempelen would announce that the machine was ready for a challenger.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kempelen would inform the player that the Turk would use the <a href="/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Initial setup" id="w">white pieces</a> and have the first move. Between moves the Turk kept its left arm on the cushion. The Turk could nod twice if it threatened its opponent&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Queen_(chess)" id="w">queen</a>, and three times upon placing the <a href="/wiki/King_(chess)" id="w">king</a> in check. If an opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, move the piece back and make its own move, thus forcing a forfeit of its opponent&#39;s move.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Louis_Dutens" id="w">Louis Dutens</a>, a traveller who observed a showing of the Turk, attempted to trick the machine &#34;by giving the Queen the move of a Knight, but my mechanic opponent was not to be so imposed upon; he took up my Queen and replaced her in the square from which I had moved her.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Dutens_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dutens" title="">[21]</a></sup> Kempelen made it a point to traverse the room during the match, and invited observers to bring magnets, irons, and <a href="/wiki/Lodestone" id="w">lodestones</a> to the cabinet to test whether the machine was run by a form of magnetism or weights. The first person to play the Turk was <a href="/wiki/Count_Ludwig_von_Cobenzl" id="w">Count Ludwig von Cobenzl</a>, an Austrian <a href="/wiki/Courtier" id="w">courtier</a> at the palace.

<p>Another part of the machine&#39;s exhibition was the completion of the knight&#39;s tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the director with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Turk also had the ability to converse with spectators using a letter board. The director, whose identity during the period when Kempelen presented the machine at Schönbrunn Palace is unknown,<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> was able to do this in <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a>, French, and <a href="/wiki/German_language" id="w">German</a>. <a href="/wiki/Carl_Hindenburg" id="w">Carl Friedrich Hindenburg</a>, a university mathematician, kept a record of the conversations during the Turk&#39;s time in <a href="/wiki/Leipzig" id="w">Leipzig</a> and published it in 1789 as <i>Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung</i> (or <i>On the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen...</i>). Topics of questions put to and answered by the Turk included its age, marital status, and its secret workings.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_tour_of_Europe" name="The_tour_of_Europe"></a><h2>The tour of Europe</h2>
<p>Following word of its debut, interest in the machine grew across Europe. Kempelen, however, was more interested in his other projects and avoided exhibiting the Turk, often lying about the machine&#39;s repair status to prospective challengers. Von Windisch wrote at one point that Kempelen &#34;refused the entreaties of his friends, and a crowd of curious persons from all countries, the satisfaction of seeing this far-famed machine.&#34;<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> In the decade following its debut at Schönbrunn Palace the Turk only played one opponent, Sir <a href="/wiki/Robert_Murray_Keith" id="w">Robert Murray Keith</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scottish</a> noble, and Kempelen went as far as dismantling the Turk entirely following the match.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Kempelen was quoted as referring to the invention as a &#34;mere <a href="/wiki/Bagatelle_(literary_technique)" id="w">bagatelle</a>,&#34; as he was not pleased with its popularity and would rather continue work on <a href="/wiki/Steam_engine" id="w">steam engines</a> and machines that replicated human speech.<sup id="_ref-Anomalies_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anomalies" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1781, Kempelen was ordered by <a href="/wiki/Joseph_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Emperor Joseph II</a> to reconstruct the Turk and deliver it to <a href="/wiki/Vienna" id="w">Vienna</a> for a state visit from Grand Duke <a href="/wiki/Paul_I_of_Russia" id="w">Paul of Russia</a> and his wife. The appearance was so successful that Grand Duke Paul suggested a tour of Europe for the Turk, a request to which Kempelen reluctantly agreed.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p>Following his tour of Paris, Kempelen moved the Turk to <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, where it was exhibited daily for five <a href="/wiki/Shilling" id="w">shillings</a>. Thicknesse, known in his time as a <a href="/wiki/Skepticism" id="w">skeptic</a>, sought out the Turk in an attempt to expose the inner workings of the machine.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> While he respected Kempelen as &#34;a very ingenious man&#34;,<sup id="_ref-Anomalies_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anomalies" title="">[1]</a></sup> he asserted that the Turk was an elaborate hoax with a small child inside the machine, describing the machine as &#34;a complicated piece of clockwork .&#160;.&#160;. which is nothing more, than one, of many other ingenious devices, to misguide and delude the observers.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Thicknesse_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Thicknesse" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>After a year in London, Kempelen and the Turk travelled to Leipzig, stopping in various European cities along the way. From Leipzig, it went to <a href="/wiki/Dresden" id="w">Dresden</a>, where Joseph Friedrich Freiherr von Racknitz viewed the Turk and published his findings in <i>Ueber den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen, nebst einer Abbildung und Beschreibung seiner Sprachmachine</i>, along with illustrations showing his beliefs about how the machine operated.

The story goes that Frederick enjoyed the Turk so much that he paid a large sum of money to Kempelen in exchange for the Turk&#39;s secrets. Frederick never gave the secret away, but was reportedly disappointed to learn how the machine worked.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> (This story is almost certainly apocryphal; there is no evidence of the Turk&#39;s encounter with Frederick, the first mention of which comes in the early 19th century, by which time the Turk was also incorrectly said to have played against George III of England.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>) It seems most likely that the machine stayed dormant at Schönbrunn Palace for over two decades, although Kempelen attempted unsuccessfully to sell it in his final years.

<p>Following the death of Kempelen, the Turk remained un-exhibited until some time before 1808 when Kempelen&#39;s son decided to sell it to Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a <a href="/wiki/Bavaria" id="w">Bavarian</a> musician with an interest in various machines and devices. Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of <a href="/wiki/Metronome" id="w">metronome</a>, had tried to purchase the Turk once before, before Kempelen&#39;s death. The original attempt had failed owing to Kempelen&#39;s asking price of 20,000 <a href="/wiki/Franc" id="w">francs</a>; Kempelen&#39;s son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Upon acquiring the Turk, Mälzel had to learn its secrets and make some repairs to get it back in working order. His stated goal was to make explaining the Turk a greater challenge. While the completion of this goal took ten years, the Turk still made appearances, most notably with Napoleon Bonaparte.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1809, Bonaparte arrived at Schönbrunn Palace to play the Turk. According to an eyewitness report, Mälzel took responsibility for the construction of the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk saluted Bonaparte prior to the start of the match. The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> According to <a href="/wiki/Bradley_Ewart" id="w">Bradley Ewart</a>, it is believed that the Turk sat at its cabinet, and Bonaparte sat at a separate chess table. Bonaparte&#39;s table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into the Turk&#39;s area, with Mälzel crossing back and forth to make each player&#39;s move and allowing a clear view for the spectators. In a surprise move, Bonaparte took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move, as was usual; but Mälzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Bonaparte attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing the move, the Turk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game. Bonaparte attempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Bonaparte then attempted the move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board. Bonaparte was reportedly amused, and then played a real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender.<sup id="_ref-Ewart_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ewart" title="">[42]</a></sup> Alternate versions of the story include Bonaparte being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later time, playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a <a href="/wiki/Shawl" id="w">shawl</a> around the head and body of the Turk in an attempt to obscure its vision.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1811, Mälzel brought the Turk to <a href="/wiki/Milan" id="w">Milan</a> for a performance with <a href="/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_de_Beauharnais" id="w">Eugène de Beauharnais</a>, the Prince of Venice and Viceroy of Italy. Beauharnais enjoyed the machine so much that he offered to purchase it from Mälzel. After some serious bargaining, Beauharnais acquired the Turk for 30,000 francs — three times what Mälzel had paid — and kept it for four years. In 1815, Mälzel returned to Beauharnais and asked to buy the Turk back, eventually working out an agreement where Mälzel would pay Beauharnais 30,000 francs from profits of future exhibitions in Europe whilst not taking the Turk off the continent.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

Mälzel stayed in France with the machine until 1818, when he moved to London and held a number of performances with the Turk and many of his other machines. In London, Mälzel and his act received a large amount of press, and he continued improving the machine,<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> ultimately installing a voice box so the machine could say &#34;Échec!&#34; when placing a player in check.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1819, Mälzel took the Turk on a tour of the entire <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>. There were several new developments in the act, such as allowing the opponent the first move and eliminating the king&#39;s bishop&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Pawn_(chess)" id="w">pawn</a> from the Turk&#39;s pieces. This <a href="/wiki/Chess_handicap#Other forms of handicap" id="w">pawn handicap</a> created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by <a href="/wiki/W._J._Hunneman" id="w">W. J.

<p>Although the appearances of the Turk were profitable for Mälzel, he fell into debt and was eventually sued by Beauharnais for his failure to honour their agreement. Mälzel was unable to sell the Turk to pay off the debts, instead taking it and his other machines to the United States. In 1826, he opened an exhibition in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> that slowly grew in popularity, giving rise to many newspaper stories and anonymous threats of exposure of the secret. Mälzel&#39;s problem was finding a proper director for the machine,<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> having trained an unknown woman in France before coming to the United States. He ended up recalling a former director, <a href="/wiki/William_Schlumberger" id="w">William Schlumberger</a>, from Europe to come to America and work for him again once Mälzel was able to provide the money for Schlumberger&#39;s transport.<sup id="_ref-AH_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AH" title="">[12]</a></sup> Before his arrival, Mälzel was forced to limit the exhibition of the machine to <a href="/wiki/Endgame" id="w">endgames</a> owing to the lack of skill of his director, much to the chagrin of the public.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>Upon Schlumberger&#39;s arrival, the Turk debuted in <a href="/wiki/Boston%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Boston</a>, Mälzel <a href="/wiki/Spin_(public_relations)" id="w">spinning</a> a story that the New York chess players could not handle full games and that the Boston players were much better opponents. This was a success for many weeks, and the tour moved to <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Philadelphia</a> for three months. Following Philadelphia, the Turk moved to <a href="/wiki/Baltimore%2C_Maryland" id="w">Baltimore</a>, where it played for a number of months, including losing a match against <a href="/wiki/Charles_Carroll_of_Carrollton" id="w">Charles Carroll</a>, a signer of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence" id="w">Declaration of Independence</a>. The exhibition in Baltimore brought news that two brothers had constructed their own machine, the <a href="/wiki/Walker_Chess-player" id="w">Walker Chess-player</a>. Mälzel viewed the competing machine and attempted to buy it, but the offer was declined and the duplicate machine toured for a number of years, never receiving the fame that Mälzel&#39;s machine did and eventually falling into obscurity.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mälzel continued with exhibitions around the United States until 1828, when he took some time off and visited Europe, returning in 1829. Throughout the 1830s, he continued to tour the United States, exhibiting the machine as far west as the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a> and visiting <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Richmond%2C_Virginia" id="w">Richmond</a>, <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a>, the Turk was observed by <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe" id="w">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, who was writing for the <i><a href="/wiki/Southern_Literary_Messenger" id="w">Southern Literary Messenger</a></i>.

<p>Mälzel eventually took the Turk to <a href="/wiki/Havana" id="w">Havana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>. In Cuba, Schlumberger died of <a href="/wiki/Yellow_fever" id="w">yellow fever</a>, leaving Mälzel without a director for his machine.

Mälzel died at sea in 1838 at age 66 during his return trip, leaving his machinery with the ship captain.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_final_years_and_beyond" name="The_final_years_and_beyond"></a><h2>The final years and beyond</h2>
<p>Upon the return of the ship on which Mälzel died, his various machines, including the Turk, fell into the hands of a friend of Mälzel&#39;s, the businessman <a href="/wiki/John_Ohl" id="w">John Ohl</a>.

<p>While many books and articles were written during the Turk&#39;s life about how it worked, most were inaccurate, drawing incorrect inferences from external observation. It was not until Dr. Silas Mitchell&#39;s series of articles for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Chess_Monthly" id="w">The Chess Monthly</a></i> that the secret was fully revealed. Mitchell, son of the final private owner of the Turk, John Kearsley Mitchell,<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> wrote that &#34;no secret was ever kept as the Turk&#39;s has been. Guessed at, in part, many times, no one of the several explanations .&#160;.&#160;. ever solved this amusing puzzle.&#34; As the Turk was lost to fire at the time of this publication, Silas Mitchell felt that there were &#34;no longer any reasons for concealing from the amateurs of chess, the solution to this ancient enigma.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Mitchell_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mitchell" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>

<p>A new article about the Turk would not turn up until 1899, when <i><a href="/wiki/The_American_Chess_Magazine" id="w">The American Chess Magazine</a></i> published an account of the Turk&#39;s match with Napoleon Bonaparte. The story was basically a review of previous accounts, and a substantive published account would not appear until 1947, when <i><a href="/wiki/Chess_Review" id="w">Chess Review</a></i> published articles by <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Harkness" id="w">Kenneth Harkness</a> and Jack Straley Battell that amounted to a comprehensive history and description of the Turk, complete with new diagrams that synthesized information from previous publications. Another article written in 1960 for <i><a href="/wiki/American_Heritage_(magazine)" id="w">American Heritage</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Wittenberg" id="w">Ernest Wittenberg</a> provided new diagrams describing how the director sat inside the cabinet.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>1945 brought the publication of <a href="/wiki/Henry_A._Davidson" id="w">Henry A. Davidson</a>&#39;s <i>A Short History of Chess</i>, which talks of the Turk, giving significant weight to Poe&#39;s essay, which erroneously suggested that the player sat inside the Turk figure rather than on a moving seat inside the cabinet.
