<b>James Jesse Strang</b> (<a href="/wiki/March_21" id="w">March 21</a> <a href="/wiki/1813" id="w">1813</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/July_9" id="w">July 9</a> <a href="/wiki/1856" id="w">1856</a>) was one of three major contenders for leadership of the <a href="/wiki/Latter_Day_Saint_movement" id="w">Latter Day Saint movement</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Succession_crisis_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">1844 Succession Crisis</a>. Rejected by the principal body of Mormons{{fn}} in <a href="/wiki/Nauvoo%2C_Illinois" id="w">Nauvoo, Illinois</a>, he became the founder and <a href="/wiki/Prophet%2C_seer_and_revelator" id="w">prophet</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints_(Strangite)" id="w">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)</a>,{{fn}} claiming it to be the sole legitimate continuation of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Christ_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Church of Christ</a> founded in 1830 by <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr." id="w">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a>.  In this capacity, he served as the crowned  &#34;king&#34; of an ecclesiastical monarchy that existed for six years within the U.S. state of <a href="/wiki/Michigan" id="w">Michigan</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast to Joseph Smith, who had served as &#34;president&#34; of his church, Strang taught that Smith&#39;s prophetic office embodied an overtly <i>royal</i> attribute, by which its occupant was to be not only the spiritual leader of his people, but their temporal <a href="/wiki/King" id="w">king</a> as well.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> He offered a sophisticated set of teachings that differed in many significant aspects from any other version of Mormonism, including that preached by Smith.  Additionally, Strang was at various times a lawyer, educator, temperance lecturer, newspaper editor, <a href="/wiki/Baptist" id="w">Baptist</a> minister, correspondent for the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Tribune" id="w">New York Tribune</a></i>, state legislator, and amateur scientist.  His survey of <a href="/wiki/Beaver_Island_(Lake_Michigan)" id="w">Beaver Island&#39;s</a> natural history was published by the <a href="/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution" id="w">Smithsonian Institution</a>, remaining the definitive work on the subject for nearly a century,<sup id="_ref-Weeks_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weeks" title="">[3]</a></sup> while his career in the Michigan legislature was praised even by his enemies.</p>
<p>To bolster his prophetic claims, Strang published translations of two allegedly long-lost works: the <a href="/wiki/Voree_plates" id="w">Voree Record</a>, deciphered from three metal plates unearthed in response to a vision; and the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_the_Law_of_the_Lord" id="w">Book of the Law of the Lord</a>, transcribed from the <a href="/wiki/Laban_(Book_of_Mormon)" id="w">Plates of Laban</a> mentioned in <a href="/wiki/The_Book_of_Mormon" id="w">The Book of Mormon</a>.  These are accepted as scripture by his followers, but not by any other Latter Day Saint church.  Building an organization that eventually rivaled <a href="/wiki/Brigham_Young" id="w">Brigham Young&#39;s</a>, Strang gained nearly 12,000 adherents<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> prior to his murder in 1856, which brought down his Beaver Island kingdom and all but extinguished his sect.  &#34;Written off&#34; by most Latter Day Saints after his demise, Strang remained largely ignored by historians until a recent resurgance of interest in his life and work.</p>
<a id="Summary_of_Latter_Day_Saint_leadership" name="Summary_of_Latter_Day_Saint_leadership"></a><h2>Summary of Latter Day Saint leadership</h2>
<p>James Strang was <a href="/wiki/Baptised" id="w">baptised</a> by Joseph Smith, Jr. as a member of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Christ_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a> on <a href="/wiki/February_25" id="w">February 25</a> <a href="/wiki/1844" id="w">1844</a> in Nauvoo, Illinois. On March 3 of that year, he was ordained an <a href="/wiki/Elder_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Elder</a> by <a href="/wiki/Hyrum_Smith" id="w">Hyrum Smith</a>, Joseph&#39;s brother. Shortly after Smith&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Death_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr." id="w">murder</a> on <a href="/wiki/June_27" id="w">June 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1844" id="w">1844</a>, Strang announced that Smith had appointed him to take over leadership of the church.  His claims were quickly rejected by ten of Smith&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Apostle_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Twelve Apostles</a>, who gained the support of most church members in Nauvoo. However, Strang managed to win enough disciples to form a viable organization of his own.  Among the more prominent of these were four of the eleven <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Mormon_witnesses" id="w">&#34;witnesses&#34;</a> to The Book of Mormon,{{fn}} three of Joseph Smith&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Apostle_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">apostles</a>,{{fn}} a leading <a href="/wiki/Bishop_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">bishop</a> of his church,{{fn}} <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> and several members of Smith&#39;s family, including his mother.  Nearly all of these later repudiated Strang, however, mostly due to his eventual sanctioning of <a href="/wiki/Polygamy" id="w">polygamy</a>.  Many would later go on to help in founding the <a href="/wiki/Community_of_Christ" id="w">Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a>,{{fn}} which became the primary advocate of a non-polygamous version of the Latter Day Saint religion.</p>

<p>Strang&#39;s church was originally centered in <a href="/wiki/Voree%2C_Wisconsin" id="w">Voree</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin" id="w">Wisconsin</a>, just outside present-day <a href="/wiki/Burlington%2C_Wisconsin" id="w">Burlington</a>, which his &#34;<a href="/wiki/Letter_of_Appointment_(Mormonism)" id="w">Letter of Appointment</a>&#34; named as the new &#34;gathering place&#34; for the Latter Day Saints.  In 1848, Strang moved his followers to Beaver Island in <a href="/wiki/Lake_Michigan" id="w">Lake Michigan</a>, where he was proclaimed the &#34;king&#34; of his people in 1850.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  While his church suffered persecution there, it continued to grow, steadily gaining converts from other Latter Day Saint sects until Strang&#39;s assassination in 1856.  His followers were subsequently driven from the island, and while most later disavowed him, a small but devout remnant still practices Strang&#39;s teachings today.</p>
<p>Strang&#39;s organization is formally known as the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints_(Strangite)" id="w">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a>.{{fn}}  During the nineteenth century, followers of <a href="/wiki/Brigham_Young" id="w">Brigham Young</a> were sometimes referred to as &#34;Brighamites,&#34; while those of <a href="/wiki/Sidney_Rigdon" id="w">Sidney Rigdon</a> were called &#34;Rigdonites,&#34; and disciples of Strang became &#34;Strangites&#34;.{{fn}} <sup id="_ref-Strangite_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Strangite" title="">[7]</a></sup> Though the term &#34;Strangite&#34; is not officially a part of their church name, it is usually added to the title to avoid confusing them with other Latter Day Saint bodies.</p>
<a id="Childhood%2C_education_and_conversion" name="Childhood%2C_education_and_conversion"></a><h2>Childhood, education and conversion</h2>
<p>James Jesse Strang was born <a href="/wiki/March_21" id="w">March 21</a> <a href="/wiki/1813" id="w">1813</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Scipio%2C_New_York" id="w">Scipio</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cayuga_County%2C_New_York" id="w">Cayuga County, New York</a>. He was the second of three children, and his parents had a good reputation in their community.  James&#39; mother was very tender with him as a consequence of delicate health, yet she required him to render an account of all his actions and words while absent from her.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>  In a brief autobiography he wrote in 1855, Strang reported that he had attended grade school until age twelve, but that &#34;the terms were usually short, the teachers inexperienced and ill qualified to teach, and my health such as to preclude attentive study or steady attendance.&#34;  He estimated that his time in a classroom during those years totalled six months.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>But none of this meant that Strang was illiterate or simple.  Although his teachers &#34;not unfrequently turned me off with little or no attention, as though I was too stupid to learn and too dull to feel neglect,&#34; Strang recalled that he spent &#34;long weary days...upon the floor, thinking, thinking, thinking....my mind wandered over fields that old men shrink from, seeking rest and finding none till darkness gathered thick around and I burst into tears.&#34;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> He studied works by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Paine" id="w">Thomas Paine</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Comte_de_Volney" id="w">Comte de Volney</a>,<sup id="_ref-Weeks_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weeks" title="">[3]</a></sup> whose book <i>Les Ruines</i> exerted a significant influence on the future prophet.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>As a youth, Strang kept a rather profound personal diary, written partly in a secret code that was not deciphered until over one hundred years after it was authored (ironically, by Strang&#39;s own grandson Mark Strang, a banker in Long Beach, California).  This journal contains Strang&#39;s musings on a variety of topics, including his desire to &#34;rival <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar" id="w">Caesar</a> or <a href="/wiki/Napoleon" id="w">Napoleon</a>&#34; and his regret that by age nineteen, he had not yet become a <a href="/wiki/General" id="w">general</a> or member of the <a href="/wiki/State_legislature" id="w">state legislature</a>, which he saw as being essential by that point in his life to his quest for fame.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>  However, Strang&#39;s diary equally reveals a sincere desire to be of service to his fellow man, together with agonized frustration at not knowing how he might do so as a penniless, unknown youth from upstate New York.  </p>
<p>At age twelve, Strang was baptised a Baptist.  He did not wish to follow his father&#39;s calling as a farmer, so he took up the study of <a href="/wiki/Civil_law" id="w">civil law</a>.  Strang was admitted to the bar in <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a> at age 23 and later at other places where he resided. He became county <a href="/wiki/Postmaster" id="w">Postmaster</a> and edited a local newspaper, the <i>Randolph Herald</i>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Later, in the midst of his myriad duties on Beaver Island, he would find time to found and publish the <i>Daily Northern Islander</i>, the first newspaper in northern Michigan.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Strang, who once described himself as a &#34;cool philosopher&#34;<sup id="_ref-Weeks_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weeks" title="">[3]</a></sup> and a <a href="/wiki/Freethinker" id="w">freethinker</a>, became a Baptist <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_religion" id="w">minister</a> but left in February of 1844 to join the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints" id="w">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a>. He quickly found favor with Joseph Smith, though they had known each other only a short time, and was baptized personally by him.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  Immediately ordained an Elder, Strang was sent forthwith at Smith&#39;s request to Wisconsin, to establish a Mormon <a href="/wiki/Stake_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">stake</a> at <a href="/wiki/Voree%2C_Wisconsin" id="w">Voree</a>.  Shortly after Strang&#39;s departure, Joseph Smith was murdered by an anti-Mormon mob in <a href="/wiki/Carthage%2C_Illinois" id="w">Carthage, Illinois</a>.</p>

<p>Following Smith&#39;s demise, several men claimed the right to lead the Latter Day Saints.  The most significant of these were Brigham Young, president of Smith&#39;s Twelve Apostles; <a href="/wiki/Sidney_Rigdon" id="w">Sidney Rigdon</a>, the sole surviving member of Smith&#39;s <a href="/wiki/First_Presidency_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">First Presidency</a>; and James Strang.  A power struggle ensued, and Young eventually led the bulk of Smith&#39;s followers to <a href="/wiki/Utah_Territory" id="w">Utah</a> while Rigdon led his to <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a>.  As a newcomer to the faith, Strang did not possess the name recognition enjoyed by his rivals, and so faced an &#34;uphill&#34; battle in his quest to be recognized as the heir to Smith&#39;s prophetic mantle.  Though the Quorum of Twelve published a notice in the <i><a href="/wiki/Times_and_Seasons" id="w">Times and Seasons</a></i> of Strang&#39;s excommunication,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Strang insisted that he had never received a legitimate trial.  He equally asserted that the Twelve had no right to sit in judgment on him, as <i>he</i> was the lawful President of the church.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>To back his claim, Strang produced a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Letter_of_appointment" id="w">Letter of Appointment</a>&#34; allegedly from Smith, carrying a Nauvoo <a href="/wiki/Postmark" id="w">postmark</a> and dated <a href="/wiki/June_18" id="w">June 18</a> <a href="/wiki/1844" id="w">1844</a>.  He furthermore testified that an <a href="/wiki/Angel" id="w">angel</a> appointed him as Joseph Smith&#39;s successor at the time Smith died.  Smith and Strang were some 200&#160;miles (320&#160;km) apart at the time, and Strang offered witnesses to affirm that he had made his announcement before news of Smith&#39;s demise was publicly available.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>  Strang&#39;s letter is held today by <a href="/wiki/Yale_University" id="w">Yale University</a>.

<p>Also championing Strang was <a href="/wiki/John_C._Bennett" id="w">John C.

Invited by Strang to join him in Voree,<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Bennett was instrumental in establishing a so-called &#34;Halcyon Order of the <a href="/wiki/Illuminati" id="w">Illuminati</a>&#34; there, with Strang as its &#34;Imperial Primate.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Weeks_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weeks" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Eventually Bennett&#39;s profligate ways caught up with him, as in Nauvoo, and Strang expelled him in 1847.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> His &#34;order&#34; fell by the wayside and has no role in Strangism today, though it did lead to conflict between Strang and some of his associates.</p>
<a id="From_monogamist_to_polygamist" name="From_monogamist_to_polygamist"></a><h2>From monogamist to polygamist</h2>
<p>About 12,000 Latter Day Saints ultimately accepted Strang&#39;s claims.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> However, not all of these followed him to Beaver Island in <a href="/wiki/Lake_Michigan" id="w">Lake Michigan</a>, where Strang&#39;s headquarters was moved in 1848.  Most of his initial adherents, including all of those listed above (with the exception of George Miller, who remained loyal to Strang until death), would leave Strang&#39;s church before his demise. John E. Page departed in July of 1849, accusing Strang of dictatorial tendencies and concurring with Bennett&#39;s furtive &#34;Illuminati&#34; order.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Martin Harris had broken with Strang by January of 1847,<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> after a failed mission to England.  Hiram Page and the Whitmers also left around this time.</p>
<p>Most defections, however, were due to Strang&#39;s seemingly abrupt &#34;about-face&#34; on the turbulent subject of polygamy.  Vehemently opposed to the practice at first,<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Strang reversed course in 1849 to become one of its strongest advocates, marrying five wives (including his original spouse, Mary) and fathering fourteen children.  Since many of his early disciples viewed him as a monogamous counterweight to Brigham Young&#39;s polygamous version of Mormonism, Strang&#39;s decision to embrace plural marriage proved costly to him and his organization.  Strang defended his new tenet by claiming that, far from enslaving or demeaning women, polygamy would <i>liberate</i> and &#34;elevate&#34; them by allowing them to choose the best possible mate based upon any factors deemed important to them--even if that mate were already married to someone else.  Rather than being forced to wed &#34;corrupt and degraded sires&#34; due to the scarcity of more suitable men, a woman could marry the man she saw as the most compatible to herself, the best candidate to father her children and give her the finest possible life, no matter how many other wives he might have.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Strang&#39;s first wife was Mary Perce, whom he married on <a href="/wiki/November_20" id="w">November 20</a> <a href="/wiki/1836" id="w">1836</a>, when she was eighteen and he was twenty-three.  They were separated in May of 1851, though they remained legally married until Strang&#39;s death.<sup id="_ref-Fitz-82_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fitz-82" title="">[31]</a></sup>  His second wife, married on <a href="/wiki/July_13" id="w">July 13</a> <a href="/wiki/1849" id="w">1849</a>, was nineteen-year old Elvira Eliza Field (who disguised herself at first as &#34;Charlie J. Douglas,&#34; Strang&#39;s purported nephew, before revealing her true identity in 1850).  Strang&#39;s third wife was thirty-one year old Betsy McNutt, whom he married on <a href="/wiki/January_19" id="w">January 19</a> <a href="/wiki/1852" id="w">1852</a>; his fourth was nineteen-year old Sarah Adelia Wright, married on <a href="/wiki/July_15" id="w">July 15</a> <a href="/wiki/1855" id="w">1855</a>.  Ironically, decades after Strang&#39;s death, Sarah would divorce her second husband, one Dr. Wing, due to <i>his</i> interest in polygamy.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>  Strang&#39;s last wife was eighteen-year old Phoebe Wright, cousin to Sarah, whom he wed on <a href="/wiki/October_27" id="w">October 27</a> <a href="/wiki/1855" id="w">1855</a>, less than one year before his murder.  </p>
<p>Sarah Wright described Strang as &#34;a very mild-spoken, kind man to his family, although his word was law.&#34;  She wrote that while each wife had her own bedroom, they shared meals and devotional time together with Strang and that life in their household was &#34;as pleasant as possible.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Weeks_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weeks" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Fitz-82_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fitz-82" title="">[31]</a></sup>  On the other hand, Strang and Phoebe Wright&#39;s daughter, Eugenia, wrote in 1936 that after only eight months of marriage, her mother had &#34;begun to feel dissatisfied with polygamy, though she loved him [Strang] devotedly all her life.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

<p>Like Joseph Smith, James Strang reported numerous visions, unearthed and translated ancient metal plates using the <a href="/wiki/Urim_and_Thummim" id="w">Urim and Thummim</a>, and claimed to have restored long-lost spiritual knowledge to humankind.  Like Smith, he presented witnesses to authenticate the records he claimed to have received.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup>  <i>Unlike</i> Smith, however, Strang offered his plates to the public for examination. The non-Mormon <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Sholes" id="w">Christopher Sholes</a>&#8211;inventor of the typewriter and editor of a local newspaper&#8211;perused Strang&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/Voree_Plates" id="w">Voree Plates</a>&#34;, a minuscule brass chronicle Strang said he had been led to by a vision in 1845.<sup id="_ref-Plates_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Plates" title="">[35]</a></sup> Sholes offered no opinion on Strang&#39;s find, but described the would-be prophet as &#34;honest and earnest&#34; and opined that his followers ranked &#34;among the most honest and intelligent men in the neighborhood.&#34;<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup>  Strang published his translation of these plates as the &#34;Voree Record,&#34; purporting to be the last testament of one &#34;Rajah Manchou of Vorito,&#34; who had lived in the area centuries earlier and wished to leave a brief statement for posterity.  While many scoffed, two modern scholars have affirmed that the text on the plates appears to represent a genuine, albeit unknown, language.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>  The Voree Plates disappeared around 1900, and their current whereabouts is unknown.<sup id="_ref-Plates_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Plates" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Strang also claimed to have translated the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Plates_of_Laban" id="w">Plates of Laban</a>&#34; described in the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Mormon" id="w">Book of Mormon</a>.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup>  This translation was published in 1851 as the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_the_Law_of_the_Lord" id="w">Book of the Law of the Lord</a>, said to be the original Law given to Moses and mentioned in II Chronicles 34:14-15.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup>  Greatly expanded and republished in 1856, this book served as the constitution for Strang&#39;s spiritual kingdom on Beaver Island, and is still accepted as scripture by Strangites.  One distinctive feature (besides its overtly monarchial tone) is its restoration of a &#34;missing&#34; commandment to the <a href="/wiki/Ten_Commandments" id="w">Decalogue</a>: <i>&#34;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&#34;</i>  Strang  insisted that versions of the Decalogue found in Bibles used by other churches--including other Latter Day Saint churches--contain only <i>nine</i> commandments, not ten.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup>   </p>

Strang received several other revelations, which while never formally added to his church&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Doctrine_and_Covenants" id="w">Doctrine and Covenants</a>, are nevertheless accepted as scripture by his followers.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup>  These concerned, among other things, Baptism for the Dead, the building of a temple in Voree, the standing of Sidney Rigdon, and an invitation for <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith_III" id="w">Joseph Smith III</a>, eldest son of Joseph Smith, Jr., to take a position as <a href="/wiki/First_Presidency_(LDS_Church)" id="w">Counselor</a> in Strang&#39;s <a href="/wiki/First_Presidency_(LDS_Church)" id="w">First Presidency</a>.  &#34;Young Joseph&#34; never accepted this calling and refused to have anything to do with Strang&#39;s organization.  Strang also authored <i>The Diamond</i>, an attack on the claims of Sidney Rigdon and Brigham Young, and <i>The Prophetic Controversy</i>, ostensibly for Mrs. Martha Coray, co-author with Lucy Mack Smith of <a href="/wiki/The_History_of_Joseph_Smith_by_His_Mother" id="w">The History of Joseph Smith by His Mother</a>.  Coray, a partisan of Brigham Young&#39;s, had challenged &#34;the vain usurper&#34; to provide convincing evidence of his claims,<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> and Strang attempted to oblige in this open letter addressed to her.  Coray&#39;s reaction to Strang&#39;s missive has not been preserved.</p>
<a id="Distinctive_dogmas" name="Distinctive_dogmas"></a><h3>Distinctive dogmas</h3>
<p>Some of Strang&#39;s teachings differed substantially from those of other Latter Day Saint leaders, including Joseph Smith.  For instance, Strang rejected the traditional Christian doctrine of the <a href="/wiki/Virgin_Birth" id="w">Virgin Birth</a> of <a href="/wiki/Jesus_Christ" id="w">Jesus Christ</a> and the Mormon doctrine of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Plurality_of_gods" id="w">plurality of gods</a>.&#34;  A <a href="/wiki/Monotheist" id="w">monotheist</a>, he insisted that there was but one eternal <a href="/wiki/God" id="w">God</a> of all the universe, the <a href="/wiki/God_the_Father" id="w">Father</a>, and that &#34;<a href="/wiki/Exaltation_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">progression to godhood</a>&#34; (a doctrine allegedly taught by Joseph Smith toward the end of his life)<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> was impossible.  God had always been God, said Strang, and He was but one Person (not three, as in the traditional Christian <a href="/wiki/Trinity" id="w">Trinity</a>).<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup>  Jesus Christ, said Strang, was the natural-born son of <a href="/wiki/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)" id="w">Mary</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saint_Joseph" id="w">Joseph</a>, who was chosen from before all time to be the Savior of mankind, but who had to be born as an ordinary mortal of two human parents (rather than being the offspring of the Father or the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Spirit" id="w">Holy Spirit</a>) to be able to fulfill his Messianic role.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup>  Strang claimed that the earthly Christ was in essence &#34;adopted&#34; as God&#39;s son at birth, and fully revealed as such during the <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration_of_Jesus" id="w">Transfiguration</a>.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup>  After proving himself to God by living a perfectly sinless life, he was thus enabled to provide an acceptable sacrifice for the sins of men, prior to his <a href="/wiki/Resurrection_appearances_of_Jesus" id="w">resurrection</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ascension_of_Jesus_Christ" id="w">ascension</a>.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Furthermore, Strang denied that God could do <i>all</i> things, and insisted that some things were as impossible for Him as for us.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup>  Thus, he saw no essential conflict between science and religion, and while he never openly championed <a href="/wiki/Introduction_to_evolution" id="w">evolution</a>, he did state that God was limited in His power by the <a href="/wiki/Matter" id="w">matter</a> He was working with and by the eons of time required to &#34;organize&#34; and shape it.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup>  Strang spoke glowingly of a future generation who would &#34;make religion a science,&#34; to be &#34;studied by as exact rules as mathematicks.&#34;  &#34;The mouth of the Seer will be opened,&#34; he prophesied, &#34;and the whole earth enlightened.&#34;<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>Musing at length on the nature of <a href="/wiki/Sin" id="w">sin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Evil" id="w">evil</a>, Strang wrote that of all things that God could give to man, He could never give him <i>experience</i>.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup>  Thus, if &#34;<a href="/wiki/Agency_(LDS_Church)" id="w">free agency</a>&#34; were to be real, said Strang, humanity must be given the opportunity to fail and to learn from its own mistakes.  The ultimate goal for each human being was to willingly conform oneself to the &#34;revealed character&#34; of God in every respect, preferring good to evil not out of a fear of punishment or any desire for reward, but rather solely &#34;on account of the innate loveliness of undefiled goodness; of pure unalloyed holiness.&#34;<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Practices" name="Practices"></a><h3>Practices</h3>
<p>Strang believed strongly in the <a href="/wiki/Saturday" id="w">Saturday</a> <a href="/wiki/Sabbath" id="w">Sabbath</a>, and enjoined it in lieu of <a href="/wiki/Sunday" id="w">Sunday</a>;<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> the Strangite church continues this tradition.  He advocated <a href="/wiki/Baptism_for_the_dead" id="w">baptism for the dead</a>, and practiced it to a limited extent in Voree and on Beaver Island.  He also introduced <a href="/wiki/Animal_sacrifice" id="w">animal sacrifice</a>&#8211;not for sin, but as a part of Strangite celebration rituals.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup>  Animal sacrifices and baptisms for the dead are not currently practiced by the Strangite organization, though belief in each is still affirmed.  Strang attempted to construct a <a href="/wiki/Temple_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">temple</a> in Voree, but was prevented from completing it due to the poverty and lack of cooperation of his followers.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup>  No &#34;<a href="/wiki/Endowment_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">endowment</a>&#34; rituals comparable to those in the Utah LDS church appear to have existed among his followers.<sup id="_ref-Women-Marriage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Women-Marriage" title="">[56]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Celestial_marriage" id="w">Eternal marriage</a> formed a part of Strang&#39;s teaching, though he did not require it to be performed in a temple (as in the LDS church).  Thus, such marriages are still contracted in Strang&#39;s church in the absence of any Strangite temple or &#34;endowment&#34; ceremony.  Alcohol, tobacco, coffee and tea were prohibited, as in many Latter Day Saint denominations. Polygamy is no longer practiced by Strang&#39;s followers, though belief in its correctness is still affirmed.<sup id="_ref-Women-Marriage_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Women-Marriage" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
<p>Strang allowed women to hold the Priesthood offices of <a href="/wiki/Priest_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Priest</a> and <a href="/wiki/Teacher_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Teacher</a>, unique among all Latter Day Saint factions during his lifetime.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup>  He welcomed <a href="/wiki/African_Americans" id="w">African Americans</a> into his church, and ordained at least two to the eldership.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> Strang also mandated <a href="/wiki/Conservation_movement" id="w">conservation</a> of land and resources, requiring the building of parks and retention of large forests in his kingdom.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup>  He wrote an eloquent refutation of the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Solomon_Spalding" id="w">Solomon Spalding</a> theory&#34; of the Book of Mormon&#39;s authorship,<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> and defended the ministry and teachings of Joseph Smith&#8211;as he understood them.</p>
<a id="Coronation_and_troubled_reign_on_Beaver_Island" name="Coronation_and_troubled_reign_on_Beaver_Island"></a><h2>Coronation and troubled reign on Beaver Island</h2>
<p>Strang claimed that he was to occupy the office of <a href="/wiki/Monarch" id="w">king</a> described in the Book of the Law of the Lord.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup>  He insisted that this authority was incumbent upon all holders of Joseph Smith&#39;s prophetic office from the beginning of time,<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> and his followers believe that <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Fifty" id="w">Smith himself was crowned secretly as &#34;king&#34; of the Mormon church</a> before his murder.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup>  Strang was accordingly crowned in 1850 by his counselor and Prime Minister, an actor named <a href="/wiki/George_J._Adams" id="w">George J. Adams</a>. About 300 people witnessed his <a href="/wiki/Coronation" id="w">coronation</a>, for which he wore a bright red flannel robe topped by a white collar with black speckles. His tin <a href="/wiki/Crown" id="w">crown</a> was described in one account as &#34;a shiny metal ring with a cluster of glass stars in the front.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Weeks_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weeks" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Strang also sported a <a href="/wiki/Breastplate" id="w">breastplate</a> and carried a wooden <a href="/wiki/Scepter" id="w">scepter</a>.  He &#34;reigned&#34; for six years, and the date of his coronation, July 8, is still mandated as one of the two most important dates in the Strangite church year (the other being April 6, the anniversary of the founding of Joseph Smith&#39;s church).<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">A view of Iron Ore Bay on the southern end of <a href="/wiki/Beaver_Island" id="w">Beaver Island</a>.</div></p>
<p>Strang never claimed to be the king of Beaver Island itself, nor of any other geographical entity. Rather, he claimed to be king over his church, which he saw as the true &#34;<a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_God" id="w">Kingdom of God</a>&#34; prophesied in Scripture and destined to spread over all the earth.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup>  Nor did Strang ever say that his &#34;kingdom&#34; supplanted United States sovereignty over Beaver Island.  However, since his sect was the main religious body on the isle, claiming the allegiance of most of its inhabitants, Strang often asserted authority even over non-Strangites on Beaver--which ultimately caused him and his followers a great deal of grief.  Furthermore, he and many of his disciples were accused of forcibly appropriating property and revenue on the island, which made him few friends among the &#34;gentiles.&#34;  </p>
<p>On the other hand, Strang and his people lived in justified apprehension of what their nonmember neighbors, many of whom were bullying and threatening toward them, might do next.  Strangites were often beaten up while going to the post office to collect their mail,<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> and some of their homes were robbed and even seized by &#34;gentiles&#34; while Strangite men were away.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup>  On <a href="/wiki/July_4" id="w">July 4</a> <a href="/wiki/1850" id="w">1850</a>, a drunken mob of fishermen vowed to kill the &#34;Mormons&#34; or drive them out, only to be awed into submission when Strang fired a cannon (which he had secretly acquired) at them.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup>  Competition for business and jobs added to tensions on the island, as did the increasing Strangite monopoly on local government, made sure after Beaver and adjacent islands were attached first to <a href="/wiki/Emmet_County%2C_Michigan" id="w">Emmet County</a> in 1853, then later organized into their own insular county of <a href="/wiki/Manitou_County%2C_Michigan" id="w">Manitou</a> in 1855.  </p>
<p>As a result of his coronation, together with lurid tales spread by George Adams (who had been excommunicated by Strang a few months after the ceremony), Strang was accused of <a href="/wiki/Treason" id="w">treason</a>, <a href="/wiki/Counterfeiting" id="w">counterfeiting</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trespass" id="w">trespass</a> on government land, and <a href="/wiki/Theft" id="w">theft</a>, among other crimes.  He was brought to trial in <a href="/wiki/Detroit%2C_Michigan" id="w">Detroit, Michigan</a>, after President <a href="/wiki/Millard_Fillmore" id="w">Millard Fillmore</a> ordered U.S. District Attorney George Bates to investigate the rumors about Strang and his colony.<sup id="_ref-Weeks_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weeks" title="">[3]</a></sup> Strang&#39;s successful trial defense brought him considerable favorable press, which he leveraged to run for, and win, a seat in the Michigan state legislature as a Democrat in 1853.  Facing a determined effort to deny him this seat due to the hostility of his enemies, he was permitted to address the legislature in his defense, after which the <a href="/wiki/Michigan_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Michigan House of Representatives</a> voted twice (first unanimously, then a second time by a 49-11 margin) to allow &#34;King Strang&#34; to join them.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>In the 1853 legislative session, Strang introduced ten bills, five of which passed.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup>  The <i>Detroit Advertiser</i>, on <a href="/wiki/February_10" id="w">February 10</a> <a href="/wiki/1853" id="w">1853</a>, wrote of Strang: &#34;Mr. Strang’s course as a member of the present Legislature, has disarmed much of the prejudices which have previously surrounded him. Whatever may be said or thought of the peculiar sect of which he is the local head, I take pleasure in stating that throughout this session he has conducted himself with the degree of decorum and propriety which have been equaled by his industry, sagacity, good temper, apparent regard for the true interests of the people, and the obligations of his official oath.&#34;<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup>  He was reelected in 1855, and did much to organize the upper portion of Michigan&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Lower_peninsula" id="w">lower peninsula</a> into <a href="/wiki/County_(United_States)" id="w">counties</a> and <a href="/wiki/Townships" id="w">townships</a>.  Strang ardently fought the illegal practice of trading liquor to local <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native American</a> tribes.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup>  This made him many enemies among those non-Strangite residents of Beaver and nearby <a href="/wiki/Mackinac_Island" id="w">Mackinac Island</a> who profited mightily from this illicit trade.</p>
<a id="Assassination" name="Assassination"></a><h2>Assassination</h2>
<p>James Strang made foes among his own people, too.  One of these, Thomas Bedford, had been flogged for <a href="/wiki/Adultery" id="w">adultery</a> on Strang&#39;s orders, and felt considerable resentment toward the &#34;king.&#34;<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup>  Another, Dr. H.D. McCulloch, had been excommunicated for drunkenness and other alleged misdeeds, after previously enjoying Strang&#39;s favor and several high offices in local government.  These conspired against Strang with Alexander Wentworth and Dr. J. Atkyn, who had allegedly endeavored (unsuccessfully) to blackmail the Strangites into paying his numerous bad debts.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup>  A decree that female Strangites must wear <a href="/wiki/Bloomers_(clothing)" id="w">&#34;bloomers&#34;</a> only added fuel to the fire for Bedford and other malcontents on Beaver Island.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup>  Pistols were procured, and the four conspirators began several days of target practice while finalizing the details of their murderous plan.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Strang apparently knew that Bedford and the others were gunning for him, he seems not to have taken them very seriously.  &#34;We laugh with bitter scorn at all these threats,&#34; he wrote in the <i>Northern Islander</i>, just days before his murder.<sup id="_ref-Weeks_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weeks" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Strang&#39;s refusal to employ a <a href="/wiki/Bodyguard" id="w">bodyguard</a> or to carry a firearm or other weapon made him an easy target.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup>      </p>

<p>On Monday, <a href="/wiki/June_16" id="w">June 16</a> <a href="/wiki/1856" id="w">1856</a>, Strang was waylaid around 7:00 PM on the dock at the harbor of <a href="/wiki/St._James_Township%2C_Michigan" id="w">St. James</a>, chief city of Beaver Island, by Wentworth and Bedford, who shot him in the back.

<p>Strang was hit three times: one bullet grazed his head, another lodged in his cheek and a third in his spine.

<a id="Death_of_a_kingdom" name="Death_of_a_kingdom"></a><h2>Death of a kingdom</h2>
<p>One day before Strang&#39;s death, on what Michigan historian <a href="/wiki/Byron_M._Cutcheon" id="w">Byron M. Cutcheon</a> later called &#34;the most disgraceful day in Michigan history,&#34;<sup id="_ref-Weeks_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weeks" title="">[3]</a></sup> a drunken mob of &#34;gentiles&#34; from Mackinac and elsewhere descended upon Beaver Island and forcibly evicted every Strangite from it.  Strang&#39;s subjects on the island&#8212;numbering approximately 2,600 persons<sup id="_ref-Weeks_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weeks" title="">[3]</a></sup>&#8212;were herded onto hastily-commandeered steamers, most after being robbed of their money and other personal possessions, and unceremoniously dumped onto docks along the shores of Lake Michigan.  A few moved back to Voree, while the rest scattered across the country.</p>
<p>Strang had refused to appoint a successor, telling his apostles to take care of their families as best they could, and await divine instruction.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup>  While his supporters endeavored to keep his church alive, Strang&#39;s unique dogma requiring his successor to be ordained by angels<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> handicapped his church in its search for a new prophet.  Lorenzo Dow Hickey, the last of Strang&#39;s apostles, emerged as an ad-hoc leader until his death in 1900, followed by <a href="/wiki/Wingfield_W._Watson" id="w">Wingfield W. Watson</a>, a <a href="/wiki/High_Priest_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">High Priest</a> in Strang&#39;s organization (until he died in 1922).  Neither of these men ever claimed Strang&#39;s office or authority, however.{{fn}} Left without a prophet to guide them, most of Strang&#39;s members (including all of his wives)<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup> departed his church in the years after his murder.  Most later joined the <a href="/wiki/Community_of_Christ" id="w">Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a>, which was established in 1860.  A few, however, continue to carry on Strang&#39;s mission as best they can, while awaiting a new successor to their fallen founder.  </p>
<p>Strang&#39;s disciples today are divided into two main factions; one is led by a Presiding High Priest, who does not claim to have the authority or priesthood office possessed by Joseph Smith or James Strang.  The other claims that the first faction is in error, and that by incorporating in 1961, it lost its identity as a faithful continuation of Strang&#39;s organization.  This second group claims that <i>it</i> is the sole true remnant of James Strang&#39;s church.{{fn}} <sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup>  Missionary work is no longer emphasized among the Strangites (unlike the LDS and many other Latter Day Saint sects), as they tend to believe that after three murdered prophets (Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and James Strang) God closed His <a href="/wiki/Dispensation" id="w">dispensation</a> to the &#34;gentiles&#34; of the West.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup> Consequently, Strang&#39;s church has continued to dwindle until the present day.  Current membership figures vary between 50 and 300 persons, depending upon the source consulted.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup></p>
<p>While proving a key player in the 1844 succession struggle, Strang&#39;s long-term influence on the Latter Day Saint movement was minimal.  His doctrinal innovations had little impact outside of his church, and he was largely ignored until recent historians began to reexamine his life and career.  For all his efforts, Strang&#39;s most vital (albeit unintended) contribution to the Latter Day Saint religion turned out to be providing some of the impetus behind creation of the Reorganized Church, which became a major rival to the Utah-based <a href="/wiki/LDS_Church" id="w">LDS Church</a> and other Latter Day Saint groups&#8211;including his own.

<ul>
<li>{{fnb}} &#34;Mormon&#34; refers to either (a) the church under Joseph Smith, Jr. from 1830-44, or (b) the group that followed Brigham Young and ultimately relocated to Utah as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  It does not refer to Strang&#39;s or any other Latter Day Saint church.  Unlike many other smaller Latter Day Saint factions, however, Strangites are not opposed to using the term &#34;Mormon&#34; to describe themselves.</li>
<li>{{fnb}} The Strangites use no hyphen in their church title and capitalize the &#34;D&#34; in &#34;Day&#34;, just as was done in Joseph Smith&#39;s church.</li>
<li>{{fnb}} David Whitmer and Martin Harris, two of the <a href="/wiki/Three_Witnesses" id="w">Three Witnesses</a>, and Hiram Page and John Whitmer of the <a href="/wiki/Eight_Witnesses" id="w">Eight Witnesses</a>. </li>
<li>{{fnb}} John Page and William Smith were apostles at Smith&#39;s death; William M&#39;Lellin had previously been an apostle, but was excommunicated in 1838.</li>
<li>{{fnb}} George Miller, who is mentioned in the LDS <i>Doctrine &#38; Covenants</i> section 124: verses 20, 62 and 70.</li>

<li>{{fnb}} Strangites still use these terms today, as do members of some other Latter Day Saint groups.</li>
<li>{{fnb}} No apostles currently remain in Strang&#39;s organization, as all Strangite apostles must be appointed by a Strangite prophet.  The highest current office in Strang&#39;s church is that of High Priest (in the &#34;incorporated&#34; faction) or Elder (in the other).</li>
