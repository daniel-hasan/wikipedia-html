In February 2003, Spacey announced that he was returning to <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> to become the artistic director of the <a href="/wiki/Old_Vic" id="w">Old Vic</a>, one of the city&#39;s oldest theatres. Spacey directed the new Old Vic Theatre Company, which stages shows eight months out of the year, starting in 2004. Spacey has noted that he is &#34;having the time of [his] life&#34;<sup id="_ref-nyt-oldvic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nyt-oldvic" title="">[7]</a></sup> working at the Old Vic, and explained that at this point in his career, he feels that he is &#34;trying to do things now that are much bigger than myself and outside of myself&#34;. During the 2004-05 season, Spacey directed a performance of the play <i><a href="/wiki/Cloaca_(film)" id="w">Cloaca</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Maria_Goos" id="w">Maria Goos</a>, which opened to mixed reviews. He performed in productions of <i>National Anthems</i> by Dennis McIntyre, as well in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Story" id="w">The Philadelphia Story</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Philip_Barry" id="w">Philip Barry</a>, playing the role made famous by Jimmy Stewart in the film version. Critics applauded Spacey&#39;s daring for taking on the management of a theatre, but noted that while his acting was impressive, his skills and judgment as a producer/manager had yet to develop. </p>
<p>The 2006 season was a year of highs and lows for Spacey. He performed to good notices in the title role of <i><a href="/wiki/Richard_II_(play)" id="w">Richard II</a></i> (directed by <a href="/wiki/Trevor_Nunn" id="w">Trevor Nunn</a>), but suffered a humiliating failure with a production of <i><a href="/wiki/Resurrection_Blues" id="w">Resurrection Blues</a></i>, a little-known Arthur Miller play, directed by film director <a href="/wiki/Robert_Altman" id="w">Robert Altman</a>. Despite an all-star Hollywood cast (including Neve Campbell and Matthew Modine) and the pedigree of Miller&#39;s script, Spacey&#39;s decision to lure Altman to the stage proved disastrous: after a fraught rehearsal period, the play opened to a critical panning, and closed only a few weeks into its run.<sup id="_ref-nyt-oldvic_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nyt-oldvic" title="">[7]</a></sup> Spacey resurrected his game later in the year, starring in <a href="/wiki/Eugene_O%26%2339%3BNeill" id="w">Eugene O&#39;Neill</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/A_Moon_for_the_Misbegotten" id="w">A Moon for the Misbegotten</a></i> along with <a href="/wiki/Colm_Meaney" id="w">Colm Meaney</a> and Eve Best. The play received excellent reviews for Spacey and Best, and was transferred to Broadway in 2007. </p>
<p>He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by <a href="/wiki/London_South_Bank_University" id="w">London South Bank University</a> in November 2005.</p>
