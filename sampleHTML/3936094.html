<b>Marc Anthony Pugh</b> (born <a href="/wiki/April_2" id="w">April 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1987" id="w">1987</a> in <a href="/wiki/Bacup" id="w">Bacup</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>)<sup id="_ref-Bury F.C.co.uk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bury F.C.co.uk" title="">[1]</a></sup> is a professional <a href="/wiki/English_people" id="w">English</a> <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">footballer</a>, currently playing for <a href="/wiki/Shrewsbury_Town_F.C." id="w">Shrewsbury Town</a> in the English <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Two" id="w">League Two</a>. He plays mainly as an <a href="/wiki/Midfielder#Attacking midfielder" id="w">attacking midfielder</a> but can play as a <a href="/wiki/Striker" id="w">striker</a> and on the <a href="/wiki/Midfielder#winger" id="w">wing</a>.<sup id="_ref-shrewsburytown f.c.co.uk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shrewsburytown f.c.co.uk" title="">[2]</a></sup> He has represented England in the North-West of England team and attended the All Saints High School in <a href="/wiki/Rossendale" id="w">Rossendale</a>.</p>
<a id="Playing_career" name="Playing_career"></a><h1>Playing career</h1>
<a id="Youth" name="Youth"></a><h2>Youth</h2>
<p>His footballing career began at the <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Championship" id="w">Football League Championship</a> side <a href="/wiki/Burnley_F.C." id="w">Burnley F.C</a> where at a young age, he started as a Centre of Excellence player, and gradually worked his way up through the ranks to become a footballing apprentice.<sup id="_ref-Sportnetwork.net_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sportnetwork.net" title="">[3]</a></sup> As a first year apprentice he played for the youth and reserve teams alongside taking a &#39;Modern Apprenticeship In Sporting Excellence&#39; at college. This was spread out over three years and by the second year the club would either take them on as 3rd year apprentices or release them.<sup id="_ref-Burnley F.C.co.uk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Burnley F.C.co.uk" title="">[4]</a></sup> Due to Marc&#39;s great goalscoring record (which led him to be named on the first-team bench<sup id="_ref-Sportnetwork.net_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sportnetwork.net" title="">[3]</a></sup>) they decided to keep him on for a third year. As a 3rd year apprentice he scored 15 goals<sup id="_ref-Clarets-mad.co.uk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Clarets-mad.co.uk" title="">[5]</a></sup> for the club&#39;s reserve and youth team. This led to him to be sent out on loan to <a href="/wiki/Kidderminster_Harriers_F.C." id="w">Kidderminster Harriers</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Nationwide_Conference" id="w">Nationwide Conference</a> team, for real footballing experience. Whilst at the Harriers, he scored one goal and made 10 appearances. Also, during a match he displayed a smart piece of skill which involved flicking the ball over an opponents head with his heel, then crossing the ball in for a teammate to score. The move was featured on <a href="/wiki/Soccer_AM" id="w">Soccer AM</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Showboat" id="w">showboating</a> section as showboat of the week. Also, during a reserve match, Marc had to play in <a href="/wiki/Goalkeeper_(football)" id="w">goal</a> after reserve keeper Mark Crossley was sent off.<sup id="_ref-Clarets-mad.co.uk_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Clarets-mad.co.uk" title="">[5]</a></sup> The Harriers eventually went on to lose the game 7-1.</p>
<p>During the course of the season, Marc learned that he would not get a professional contract at Burnley, and would be released at the end of the season. This was partly due to the fact that both <a href="/wiki/Chris_McCann_(footballer)" id="w">Chris McCann</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kyle_Lafferty" id="w">Kyle Lafferty</a> had both already received first team contracts and they were only 2nd year apprentices.</p>

<a id="Bury" name="Bury"></a><h4>Bury</h4>
<p>Having just been released from Burnley, Marc started looking for a new club, and was eventually offered a place at <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Two" id="w">League Two</a> side <a href="/wiki/Bury_F.C." id="w">Bury FC</a>. At the time of Marc&#39;s arrival at Bury, the threat of relegation loomed over the club. On top of this, the club had lost several good players to <a href="/wiki/Preston_North_End_F.C." id="w">Preston</a> (including David Nugent and Simon Whaley). As a result, Bury&#39;s season had slumped and they were entangled in a relegation battle. Pugh ended up playing six games in the 05/06 season for the club (including 3 as a sub) and scored his first goal in the 1-1 draw against <a href="/wiki/Lincoln_City_F.C." id="w">Lincoln City</a>.<sup id="_ref-manchestereveningnews.co.uk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-manchestereveningnews.co.uk" title="">[6]</a></sup> As a result of his good performances (and helped by the fact that Bury had survived relegation), Bury manager <a href="/wiki/Chris_Casper" id="w">Chris Casper</a> offered him a one year deal at <a href="/wiki/Gigg_Lane" id="w">Gigg Lane</a>; his first professional contract. Pugh was very much a first team player in the <a href="/wiki/2006-07_in_English_football" id="w">2006-07</a> season, playing particularly well in the first half of the season and was offered an extended contract by Chris Casper<sup id="_ref-clarets-mad.co.uk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarets-mad.co.uk" title="">[7]</a></sup> incidently this extension was turned down by Marc as he &#34;wanted to keep his options open&#34;<sup id="_ref-http://news.bbc.co.uk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-http://news.bbc.co.uk" title="">[8]</a></sup>. He was offered contracts throughout the season but still took none of them, Casper blamed his agent for this<sup id="_ref-clarets-mad.co.uk_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarets-mad.co.uk" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-shrewsburytown f.c.co.uk_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shrewsburytown f.c.co.uk" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<a id="Shrewsbury_Town" name="Shrewsbury_Town"></a><h4>Shrewsbury Town</h4>
<p>With many clubs chasing his services,<sup id="_ref-clarets-mad.co.uk_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clarets-mad.co.uk" title="">[7]</a></sup> Pugh eventually signed for <a href="/wiki/Shrewsbury_Town_F.C." id="w">Shrewsbury Town</a> on <a href="/wiki/29_May" id="w">29 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.<sup id="_ref-Shrews complete signing of trio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shrews complete signing of trio" title="">[9]</a></sup> It was also revealed that Shrewsbury manager <a href="/wiki/Gary_Peters_(footballer)" id="w">Gary Peters</a> had already tried to sign Pugh earlier in the season as part of a swap deal when striker <a href="/wiki/Glynn_Hurst" id="w">Glynn Hurst</a> moved to <a href="/wiki/Bury_F.C." id="w">Bury</a>.<sup id="_ref-shrewsburytown f.c.co.uk_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shrewsburytown f.c.co.uk" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
