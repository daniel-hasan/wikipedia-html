<p>Caffeine is a <a href="/wiki/Plant" id="w">plant</a> <a href="/wiki/Alkaloid" id="w">alkaloid</a>, found in many plant species, where it acts as a natural <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" id="w">pesticide</a> with high caffeine levels being reported in seedlings that are still developing foliages, but are lacking mechanical protection;<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> caffeine <a href="/wiki/Paralyze" id="w">paralyzes</a> and kills certain <a href="/wiki/Insect" id="w">insects</a> feeding upon the plant.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> High caffeine levels have also been found in the surrounding soil of coffee bean seedlings. It is therefore understood that caffeine has a natural function in both a natural pesticide and as an inhibitor of seed germination of other nearby coffee seedlings<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> thus giving it a better chance of survival.</p>
<p>The most commonly used caffeine-containing plants are <a href="/wiki/Coffee" id="w">coffee</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tea" id="w">tea</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href="/wiki/Cocoa" id="w">cocoa</a>. Other, less commonly used, sources of caffeine include the <a href="/wiki/Yerba_mate" id="w">yerba mate</a><sup id="_ref-mateine_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mateine" title="">[7]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Guarana" id="w">guarana</a> plants, which are sometimes used in the preparation of teas and energy drinks. Two of caffeine&#39;s alternative names, <i>mateine</i><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> and <i>guaranine</i>,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> are derived from the names of these plants. Some yerba mate enthusiasts assert that mateine is a <a href="/wiki/Stereoisomer" id="w">stereoisomer</a> of caffeine, which would make it a different substance altogether.<sup id="_ref-mateine_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mateine" title="">[7]</a></sup> However, caffeine is an <a href="/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)" id="w">achiral</a> molecule, and therefore has no stereoisomers. Many natural sources of caffeine also contain widely varying mixtures of other <a href="/wiki/Xanthine" id="w">xanthine</a> <a href="/wiki/Alkaloid" id="w">alkaloids</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/Cardiac" id="w">cardiac</a> stimulants <a href="/wiki/Theophylline" id="w">theophylline</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theobromine" id="w">theobromine</a> and other substances such as <a href="/wiki/Polyphenols" id="w">polyphenols</a> which can form insoluble complexes with caffeine.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The world&#39;s primary source of caffeine is the coffee bean (the seed of the <a href="/wiki/Coffea" id="w">coffee plant</a>), from which <a href="/wiki/Coffee" id="w">coffee</a> is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of <a href="/wiki/Coffee_bean" id="w">coffee bean</a> and the method of preparation used;<sup id="_ref-ICO_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ICO" title="">[11]</a></sup> even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 40 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of <i>arabica</i>-variety <a href="/wiki/Espresso" id="w">espresso</a>, to about 100 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of drip coffee. Generally, dark-roast coffee has less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces the bean&#39;s caffeine content.<sup id="_ref-caffaq_roast_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-caffaq_roast" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-jeremiahspick_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeremiahspick" title="">[13]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Coffea_arabica" id="w">&#39;&#39;Arabica&#39;&#39;</a> coffee normally contains less caffeine than the <a href="/wiki/Coffea_canephora" id="w">&#39;&#39;robusta&#39;&#39;</a> variety.<sup id="_ref-ICO_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ICO" title="">[11]</a></sup> Coffee also contains trace amounts of <a href="/wiki/Theophylline" id="w">theophylline</a>, but no <a href="/wiki/Theobromine" id="w">theobromine</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Tea" id="w">Tea</a> is another common source of caffeine. Tea usually contains about half as much caffeine per serving as coffee, depending on the strength of the brew. Certain types of tea, such as <a href="/wiki/Black_tea" id="w">black</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oolong" id="w">oolong</a>, contain somewhat more caffeine than most other teas. Tea contains small amounts of theobromine and slightly higher levels of theophylline than coffee. Preparation has a significant impact on tea, and color is a very poor indicator of caffeine content.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Teas like the pale Japanese <a href="/wiki/Green_tea" id="w">green tea</a> <a href="/wiki/Gyokuro" id="w">gyokuro</a>, for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like <a href="/wiki/Lapsang_souchong" id="w">lapsang souchong</a>, which has very little.</p>
<p>Caffeine is also a common ingredient of <a href="/wiki/Soft_drink" id="w">soft drinks</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Cola" id="w">cola</a>, originally prepared from <a href="/wiki/Kola_nut" id="w">kola nuts</a>. Soft drinks typically contain about 10 to 50&#160;milligrams of caffeine per serving. By contrast, <a href="/wiki/Energy_drink" id="w">energy drinks</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Red_Bull" id="w">Red Bull</a> contain as much as 80&#160;milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of <a href="/wiki/Decaffeination" id="w">decaffeination</a> or from chemical synthesis. <a href="/wiki/Guarana" id="w">Guarana</a>, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of <a href="/wiki/Theobromine" id="w">theobromine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theophylline" id="w">theophylline</a> in a naturally occurring <a href="/wiki/Slow-release" id="w">slow-release</a> <a href="/wiki/Excipient" id="w">excipient</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Chocolate" id="w">Chocolate</a> derived from <a href="/wiki/Cocoa" id="w">cocoa</a> contains a small amount of caffeine. The weak stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of <a href="/wiki/Theobromine" id="w">theobromine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theophylline" id="w">theophylline</a> as well as caffeine.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Chocolate contains too little of these compounds for a reasonable serving to create effects in humans that are on par with <a href="/wiki/Coffee" id="w">coffee</a>. A typical 28-gram serving of a milk <a href="/wiki/Chocolate_bar" id="w">chocolate bar</a> has about as much caffeine as a cup of <i>decaffeinated</i> coffee.</p>
<p>Caffeine can be absorbed through the skin, and so in recent years various manufacturers have begun putting caffeine into shower products such as <a href="/wiki/Shampoo" id="w">shampoo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Soap" id="w">soap</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>Humans have consumed caffeine since the <a href="/wiki/Stone_Age" id="w">Stone Age</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> Early peoples found that chewing the seeds, bark, or leaves of certain plants had the effects of easing fatigue, stimulating awareness, and elevating mood. Only much later was it found that the effect of caffeine was increased by steeping such plants in hot water. Many cultures have legends that attribute the discovery of such plants to people living many thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>According to one popular Chinese legend, the <a href="/wiki/Emperor_of_China" id="w">Emperor of China</a> <a href="/wiki/Shennong" id="w">Shennong</a>, reputed to have reigned in about 3,000 BC, accidentally discovered that when some leaves fell into boiling water, a fragrant and restorative <a href="/wiki/Caffeinated_drink" id="w">drink</a> resulted.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Shennong is also mentioned in Lu Yu&#39;s <i>Cha Jing</i>, a famous early work on the subject of tea.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup>
The history of coffee has been recorded as far back as the ninth century. During that time, coffee beans were available only in their native habitat, <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" id="w">Ethiopia</a>. A popular legend traces its discovery to a <a href="/wiki/Goatherder" id="w">goatherder</a> named <a href="/wiki/Kaldi" id="w">Kaldi</a>, who apparently observed goats that became elated and sleepless at night after browsing on coffee shrubs and, upon trying the berries that the goats had been eating, experienced the same vitality. The earliest literary mention of coffee may be a reference to Bunchum in the works of the 9th century <a href="/wiki/Persian_people" id="w">Persian</a> physician <a href="/wiki/Al-Razi" id="w">al-Razi</a>. In 1587, <a href="/wiki/Malaye_Jaziri" id="w">Malaye Jaziri</a> compiled a work tracing the history and legal controversies of coffee, entitled &#34;Umdat al safwa fi hill al-qahwa&#34;. In this work, Jaziri recorded that one <a href="/wiki/Sheikh" id="w">Sheikh</a>, Jamal-al-Din al-Dhabhani, <a href="/wiki/Mufti" id="w">mufti</a> of <a href="/wiki/Aden" id="w">Aden</a>, was the first to adopt the use of coffee in 1454, and that in the 15th century the <a href="/wiki/Sufism" id="w">Sufis</a> of <a href="/wiki/Yemen" id="w">Yemen</a> routinely used coffee to stay awake during prayers.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the 16th century, the use of coffee was recorded by a <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">European</a> resident in <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>, and about this time it came into general use in the <a href="/wiki/Near_East" id="w">Near East</a>. The appreciation of coffee as a beverage in Europe, where it was first known as &#34;Arabian wine,&#34; dates from the 17th century. During this time &#34;<a href="/wiki/Coffee_house" id="w">coffee houses</a>&#34; were established, the first being opened in <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" id="w">Constantinople</a> and <a href="/wiki/Venice" id="w">Venice</a>. In Britain, the first coffee houses were opened in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> in 1652, at St Michael&#39;s Alley, <a href="/wiki/Cornhill" id="w">Cornhill</a>. They soon became popular throughout <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe" id="w">Western Europe</a>, and played a significant role in <a href="/wiki/Social_relation" id="w">social relations</a> in the 17th and 18th centuries.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Kola_nut" id="w">kola nut</a>, like the coffee berry and tea leaf, appears to have ancient origins. It is chewed in many <a href="/wiki/West_Africa" id="w">West African</a> cultures, individually or in a social setting, to restore vitality and ease hunger pangs.  In 1911, kola became the focus of one of the earliest documented health scares when the US government seized 40 barrels and 20 kegs of <a href="/wiki/Coca-Cola" id="w">Coca-Cola</a> syrup in <a href="/wiki/Chattanooga%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Chattanooga, Tennessee</a>, alleging that the caffeine in its drink was &#34;injurious to health&#34;.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/March_13" id="w">March 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1911" id="w">1911</a>, the government initiated <i>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_v._Forty_Barrels_and_Twenty_Kegs_of_Coca-Cola" id="w">United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola</a></i>, hoping to force Coca-Cola to remove caffeine from its formula by making claims, such as that the excessive use of Coca-Cola at one girls&#39; school led to &#34;wild nocturnal freaks, violations of college rules and female proprieties, and even immoralities.&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Although the judge ruled in favor of Coca-Cola, two bills were introduced to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">U.S. House of Representatives</a> in 1912 to amend the <a href="/wiki/Pure_Food_and_Drug_Act" id="w">Pure Food and Drug Act</a>, adding caffeine to the list of &#34;habit-forming&#34; and &#34;deleterious&#34; substances which must be listed on a product&#39;s label.</p>
<p>The earliest evidence of <a href="/wiki/Cocoa" id="w">cocoa</a> use comes from residue found in an <a href="/wiki/Maya_civilization" id="w">ancient Mayan</a> pot dated to 600 BC. In the New World, chocolate was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called <i>xocoatl</i>, often seasoned with <a href="/wiki/Vanilla" id="w">vanilla</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chile_pepper" id="w">chile pepper</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Achiote" id="w">achiote</a>. Xocoatl was believed to fight fatigue, a belief that is probably attributable to the <a href="/wiki/Theobromine" id="w">theobromine</a> and caffeine content. Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout <a href="/wiki/Pre-Columbian" id="w">pre-Columbian</a> <a href="/wiki/Mesoamerica" id="w">Mesoamerica</a>, and cocoa beans were often used as currency.</p>
<p>Chocolate was introduced to <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_people" id="w">Spaniards</a> and became a popular beverage by 1700. They also introduced the <a href="/wiki/Cacao" id="w">cacao</a> tree into the <a href="/wiki/West_Indies" id="w">West Indies</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippines</a>. It was used in <a href="/wiki/Alchemy" id="w">alchemical</a> processes, where it was known as Black Bean.</p>
<p>In 1819, the <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> chemist <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Ferdinand_Runge" id="w">Friedrich Ferdinand Runge</a> isolated relatively pure caffeine for the first time. According to Runge, he did this at the behest of <a href="/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe" id="w">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>.<sup id="_ref-weinberg_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-weinberg" title="">[24]</a></sup> In 1927, Oudry isolated &#34;theine&#34; from tea, but it was later proved by <a href="/wiki/Gerardus_Johannes_Mulder" id="w">Mulder</a> and Jobat that theine was the same as caffeine.<sup id="_ref-weinberg_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-weinberg" title="">[24]</a></sup> The structure of caffeine was elucidated near the end of the 19th century by <a href="/wiki/Hermann_Emil_Fischer" id="w">Hermann Emil Fischer</a>, who was also the first to achieve its <a href="/wiki/Total_synthesis" id="w">total synthesis</a>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> This was part of the work for which Fischer was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902.</p>

<p>Caffeine is a <a href="/wiki/Central_nervous_system" id="w">central nervous system</a> and metabolic stimulant,<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> and is used both recreationally and medically to reduce physical fatigue and restore mental alertness when unusual weakness or drowsiness occurs. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system first at the higher levels, resulting in increased alertness and wakefulness, faster and clearer flow of thought, increased focus, and better general body coordination, and later at the spinal cord level at higher doses.<sup id="_ref-effects_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-effects" title="">[28]</a></sup> Once inside the body, it has a complex chemistry, and acts through several mechanisms as described below.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Caffeine&#39;s principal mode of action is as an <a href="/wiki/Receptor_antagonist" id="w">antagonist</a> of <a href="/wiki/Adenosine" id="w">adenosine</a> receptors in the brain. They are presented here side by side for comparison.</div></div>
</p>
<p>Caffeine acts through multiple mechanisms involving both action on receptors and channels on the cell membrane, as well as intracellular action on calcium and <a href="/wiki/CAMP" id="w">cAMP</a> pathways. By virtue of its <a href="/wiki/Purine" id="w">purine</a> structure it can act on some of the same targets as adenosine related nucleosides and nucleotides, like the cell surface P1 <a href="/wiki/GPCR" id="w">GPCRs</a> for adenosine, as well as the intracellular <a href="/wiki/Ryanodine_receptor" id="w">Ryanodine receptor</a> (RyR) which is the physiological target of cADPR (<a href="/wiki/Cyclic_ADP-ribose" id="w">cyclic ADP-ribose</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Phosphodiesterase" id="w">cAMP-phosphodiesterase</a> (cAMP-PDE). Although the action is <a href="/wiki/Agonist" id="w">agonistic</a> in some cases, it is <a href="/wiki/Receptor_antagonist" id="w">antagonistic</a> in others. Physiologically, however, caffeine action is unlikely due to increased RyR opening, as it requires plasma concentration above lethal dosage. The action is most likely through adenosine receptors.</p>
<p>Like alcohol, nicotine, and antidepressants, caffeine readily crosses the <a href="/wiki/Blood_brain_barrier" id="w">blood brain barrier</a>. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action of caffeine is as an <a href="/wiki/Receptor_antagonist" id="w">antagonist</a> of <a href="/wiki/Adenosine_receptor" id="w">adenosine receptors</a> found in the brain.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to <a href="/wiki/Adenosine" id="w">adenosine</a>, and binds to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them (an &#34;antagonist&#34; mechanism of action). Therefore, caffeine acts as a <a href="/wiki/Competitive_inhibitor" id="w">competitive inhibitor</a>. The reduction in adenosine activity results in increased activity of the <a href="/wiki/Neurotransmitter" id="w">neurotransmitter</a> <a href="/wiki/Dopamine" id="w">dopamine</a>, largely accounting for the stimulatory effects of caffeine. Caffeine can also increase levels of <a href="/wiki/Epinephrine" id="w">epinephrine/adrenaline</a>,<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> possibly via a different mechanism. Acute usage of caffeine also increases levels of <a href="/wiki/Serotonin" id="w">serotonin</a>, causing positive changes in mood.<sup id="_ref-in da brain_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-in da brain" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Caffeine is also a known competitive inhibitor of the enzyme <a href="/wiki/Phosphodiesterase" id="w">cAMP-phosphodiesterase</a> (cAMP-PDE), which converts <a href="/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate" id="w">cyclic AMP</a> (cAMP) in cells to its noncyclic form, allowing cAMP to build up in cells. Cyclic AMP participates in activation of <a href="/wiki/Protein_Kinase_A" id="w">Protein Kinase A</a> (PKA) to begin the phosphorylation of specific enzymes used in glucose synthesis. By blocking its removal caffeine intensifies and prolongs the effects of <a href="/wiki/Epinephrine" id="w">epinephrine</a> and epinephrine-like drugs such as <a href="/wiki/Amphetamine" id="w">amphetamine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Methamphetamine" id="w">methamphetamine</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Methylphenidate" id="w">methylphenidate</a>. Increased concentrations of cAMP in <a href="/wiki/Parietal_cell" id="w">parietal cells</a> causes an increased activation of <a href="/wiki/CAMP-dependent_protein_kinase" id="w">protein kinase A</a> (PKA) which in turn increases activation of <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_potassium_ATPase" id="w">H+/K+ ATPase</a>, resulting finally in increased <a href="/wiki/Gastric_acid" id="w">gastric acid</a> secretion by the cell.</p>
<p>Caffeine (and theophylline) can freely diffuse into cells and causes intracellular calcium release (independent of extracellular calcium) from the calcium stores in the <a href="/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum" id="w">endoplasmic reticulum</a>(ER). This release is only partially blocked by Ryanodine receptor blockade with <a href="/wiki/Ryanodine" id="w">ryanodine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dantrolene" id="w">dantrolene</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ruthenium_red" id="w">ruthenium red</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Procaine" id="w">procaine</a> (thus may involve <a href="/wiki/Ryanodine_receptor" id="w">ryanodine receptor</a> and probably some additional calcium channels), but completely abolished after calcium depletion of ER by <a href="/wiki/SERCA" id="w">SERCA</a> inhibitors like <a href="/wiki/Thapsigargin" id="w">Thapsigargin</a> (TG) or <a href="/wiki/Cyclopiazonic_acid" id="w">cyclopiazonic acid</a> (CPA).<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> The action of caffeine on the ryanodine receptor may depend on both cytosolic and the luminal ER concentrations of Ca2+. At low millimolar concentration of caffeine, the RyR channel open probability (Po) is significantly increased mostly due to a shortening of the lifetime of the closed state. At concentrations &#62;5 mM, caffeine opens RyRs even at picomolar cytosolic Ca2+ and dramatically increases the open time of the channel so that the calcium release is stronger than even an action potential can generate. This mode of action of caffeine is probably due to mimicking the action of the physiologic metabolite of NAD called cADPR (<a href="/wiki/Cyclic_ADP_ribose" id="w">cyclic ADP ribose</a>) which has a similar potentiating action on <a href="/wiki/Ryanodine_receptor" id="w">Ryanodine receptors</a>.</p>
<p>Caffeine may also directly inhibit delayed rectifier and A-type K+ currents and activate plasmalemmal Ca2+ influx in certain vertebrate and invertebrate neurons.</p>
<p>The metabolites of caffeine contribute to caffeine&#39;s effects. Theobromine is a <a href="/wiki/Vasodilation" id="w">vasodilator</a> that increases the amount of oxygen and nutrient flow to the brain and muscles. Theophylline, the second of the three primary metabolites, acts as a smooth <a href="/wiki/Muscle_relaxant" id="w">muscle relaxant</a> that chiefly affects <a href="/wiki/Bronchiole" id="w">bronchioles</a> and acts as a <a href="/wiki/Chronotropic" id="w">chronotrope</a> and <a href="/wiki/Inotrope" id="w">inotrope</a> that increases heart rate and efficiency. The third metabolic derivative, paraxanthine, is responsible for an increase in the <a href="/wiki/Lipolysis" id="w">lipolysis</a> process, which releases <a href="/wiki/Glycerol" id="w">glycerol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fatty_acids" id="w">fatty acids</a> into the blood to be used as a source of fuel by the muscles.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>

<p>The precise amount of caffeine necessary to produce effects varies from person to person depending on body size and degree of tolerance to caffeine. It takes less than an hour for caffeine to begin affecting the body and a mild dose wears off in three to four hours.<sup id="_ref-effects_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-effects" title="">[28]</a></sup> Consumption of caffeine does not eliminate the need for sleep: it only temporarily reduces the sensation of being tired.</p>
<p>With these effects, caffeine is an <a href="/wiki/Ergogenic_aid" id="w">ergogenic</a>: increasing the capacity for mental or physical labor. A study conducted in 1979 showed a 7% increase in distance cycled over a period of two hours in subjects who consumed caffeine compared to control tests.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Other studies attained much more dramatic results; one particular study of trained runners showed a 44% increase in &#34;race-pace&#34; endurance, as well as a 51% increase in cycling endurance, after a dosage of 9 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> The extensive boost shown in the runners is not an isolated case; additional studies have reported similar effects. Another study found 5.5 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body mass resulted in subjects cycling 29% longer during high intensity circuits.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>

<p>Because caffeine is primarily an <a href="/wiki/Receptor_antagonist" id="w">antagonist</a> of the central nervous system&#39;s receptors for the <a href="/wiki/Neurotransmitter" id="w">neurotransmitter</a> <a href="/wiki/Adenosine" id="w">adenosine</a>, the bodies of individuals who regularly consume caffeine adapt to the continual presence of the drug by substantially increasing the number of <a href="/wiki/Adenosine_receptor" id="w">adenosine receptors</a> in the central nervous system. This increase in the number of the adenosine receptors makes the body much more sensitive to adenosine, with two primary consequences.<sup id="_ref-PMID 3003150_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PMID 3003150" title="">[50]</a></sup> First, the stimulatory effects of caffeine are substantially reduced, a phenomenon known as a <a href="/wiki/Drug_tolerance" id="w">tolerance adaptation</a>. Second, because these adaptive responses to caffeine make individuals much more sensitive to adenosine, a reduction in caffeine intake will effectively increase the normal physiological effects of adenosine, resulting in unwelcome withdrawal symptoms in tolerant users.<sup id="_ref-PMID 3003150_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PMID 3003150" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other research questions the idea that up-regulation of adenosine receptors is responsible for tolerance to the locomotor stimulant effects of caffeine, noting, among other things, that this tolerance is insurmountable by higher doses of caffeine (it should be surmountable if tolerance was due to an increase in receptors), and that the increase in adenosine receptor number is modest and doesn&#39;t explain the large tolerance which develops to caffeine.<sup id="_ref-pmid1846425_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pmid1846425" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>Caffeine tolerance develops very quickly, especially among heavy coffee and energy drink consumers. Complete tolerance to sleep disruption effects of caffeine develops after consuming 400 mg of caffeine 3 times a day for 7 days. Complete tolerance to subjective effects of caffeine was observed to develop after consuming 300 mg 3 times per day for 18 days, and possibly even earlier.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> Partial tolerance to caffeine has been observed in all other areas, studies with mice indicate that after a long period of caffeine exposure the learning benefits of caffeine observed earlier cannot be found to any significant level. Considering that 80% to 90% of American adults consume caffeine daily, and their mean daily caffeine intake exceeds 200 mg/day,<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> it can be surmised that a large fraction of the U.S. adult population is completely tolerant to most of the effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>Because adenosine, in part, serves to regulate blood pressure by causing <a href="/wiki/Vasodilation" id="w">vasodilation</a>, the increased effects of adenosine due to caffeine withdrawal cause the blood vessels of the head to dilate, leading to an excess of blood in the head and causing a <a href="/wiki/Headache" id="w">headache</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nausea" id="w">nausea</a>. Reduced <a href="/wiki/Catecholamine" id="w">catecholamine</a> activity may cause feelings of <a href="/wiki/Fatigue_(physical)" id="w">fatigue</a> and drowsiness. A reduction in serotonin levels when caffeine use is stopped can cause anxiety, irritability, inability to concentrate and diminished motivation to initiate or to complete daily tasks; in extreme cases it may cause mild <a href="/wiki/Depression_(mood)" id="w">depression</a>. Together, these effects have come to be known as a &#34;crash&#34;.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Withdrawal" id="w">Withdrawal</a> symptoms—possibly including headache, irritability, an inability to concentrate, and stomach aches<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup>—may appear within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of caffeine intake, peak at roughly 48 hours, and usually last from one to five days, representing the time required for the number of adenosine receptors in the brain to revert to &#34;normal&#34; levels, uninfluenced by caffeine consumption.  <a href="/wiki/Analgesic" id="w">Analgesics</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Aspirin" id="w">aspirin</a>, can relieve the pain symptoms, as can a small dose of caffeine.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> Most effective is a combination of both an analgesic and a small amount of caffeine.</p>
<p>This is not the only case where caffeine increases the effectiveness of a drug. Caffeine makes pain relievers 40% more effective in relieving headaches and helps the body absorb headache medications more quickly, bringing faster relief.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> For this reason, many over-the-counter headache drugs include caffeine in their formula. It is also used with <a href="/wiki/Ergotamine" id="w">ergotamine</a> in the treatment of <a href="/wiki/Migraine" id="w">migraine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cluster_headaches" id="w">cluster headaches</a> as well as to overcome the drowsiness caused by <a href="/wiki/Antihistamine" id="w">antihistamines</a>.</p>
<a id="Overuse" name="Overuse"></a><h2>Overuse</h2>
<p>In large amounts, and especially over extended periods of time, caffeine can lead to a condition known as <i>caffeinism.</i><sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-BJoA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BJoA" title="">[59]</a></sup> Caffeinism usually combines caffeine <a href="/wiki/Chemical_dependency" id="w">dependency</a> with a wide range of unpleasant physical and mental conditions including <a href="/wiki/Anxiety" id="w">nervousness</a>, <a href="/wiki/Irritability" id="w">irritability</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anxiety" id="w">anxiety</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tremor" id="w">tremulousness</a>, <a href="/wiki/Muscle_twitching" id="w">muscle twitching</a> (<a href="/wiki/Hyperreflexia" id="w">hyperreflexia</a>), <a href="/wiki/Insomnia" id="w">insomnia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Headaches" id="w">headaches</a>, <a href="/wiki/Respiratory_alkalosis" id="w">respiratory alkalosis</a><sup id="_ref-COAM_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-COAM" title="">[60]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Heart_palpitation" id="w">heart palpitations</a>.<sup id="_ref-EofMD_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EofMD" title="">[61]</a></sup>   Furthermore, because caffeine increases the production of stomach acid, high usage over time can lead to <a href="/wiki/Peptic_ulcer" id="w">peptic ulcers</a>, erosive <a href="/wiki/Esophagitis" id="w">esophagitis</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease" id="w">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a>.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> However, since both &#34;regular&#34; and decaffeinated coffees have been shown to stimulate the gastric mucosa and increase stomach acid secretion, caffeine is probably not the sole component of coffee responsible.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are four caffeine-induced psychiatric disorders recognized by the <i><a href="/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders" id="w">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>, Fourth Edition</i>: caffeine intoxication, caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, <a href="/wiki/Caffeine-induced_sleep_disorder" id="w">caffeine-induced sleep disorder</a>, and caffeine-related disorder not otherwise specified (NOS).</p>
<a id="Caffeine_intoxication" name="Caffeine_intoxication"></a><h4>Caffeine intoxication</h4>
<p>An acute overdose of caffeine, usually in excess of 400 milligrams (more than 3&#8211;4 cups of brewed coffee), can result in a state of central nervous system overstimulation called caffeine intoxication. Some people seeking caffeine intoxication resort to  <a href="/wiki/Insufflate" id="w">insufflation</a> (snorting) of caffeine powder, usually finely crushed caffeine tablets. This induces a faster and more intense reaction. The symptoms of caffeine intoxication are not unlike overdoses of other <a href="/wiki/Stimulants" id="w">stimulants</a>. It may include restlessness, <a href="/wiki/Nervousness" id="w">nervousness</a>, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, <a href="/wiki/Diuresis" id="w">increased urination</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract" id="w">gastrointestinal</a> disturbance, <a href="/wiki/Fasciculation" id="w">muscle twitching</a>, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, <a href="/wiki/Cardiac_arrhythmia" id="w">irregular</a> or  <a href="/wiki/Tachycardia" id="w">rapid heart beat</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Psychomotor_agitation" id="w">psychomotor agitation</a>.<sup id="_ref-EofMD_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EofMD" title="">[61]</a></sup> In cases of much larger overdoses <a href="/wiki/Mania" id="w">mania</a>, <a href="/wiki/Depression_(mood)" id="w">depression</a>, lapses in judgment, <a href="/wiki/Disorientation" id="w">disorientation</a>, loss of social inhibition, <a href="/wiki/Delusions" id="w">delusions</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hallucinations" id="w">hallucinations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Psychosis" id="w">psychosis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis" id="w">rhabdomyolysis</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Death" id="w">death</a> may occur.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>In cases of extreme overdose, death can result. The median lethal dose (<a href="/wiki/LD50" id="w">LD&#60;sub&#62;50&#60;/sub&#62;</a>) of caffeine is 192&#160;milligrams per kilogram in rats.<sup id="_ref-ld50_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ld50" title="">[66]</a></sup> The LD<sub>50</sub> of caffeine in humans is dependent on weight and individual sensitivity and estimated to be about 150 to 200&#160;milligrams per kilogram of body mass, roughly 80 to 100 cups of coffee for an average adult taken within a limited timeframe that is dependent on <a href="/wiki/Biological_halflife" id="w">half-life</a>. Though achieving lethal dose with caffeine would be exceptionally difficult with regular coffee, there have been reported deaths from overdosing on caffeine pills, with serious symptoms of overdose requiring hospitalization occurring from as little as 2 grams of caffeine.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> Death typically occurs due to <a href="/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation" id="w">ventricular fibrillation</a> brought about by effects of caffeine on the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>Treatment of severe caffeine intoxication is generally supportive, providing treatment of the immediate symptoms, but if the patient has very high serum levels of caffeine then <a href="/wiki/Peritoneal_dialysis" id="w">peritoneal dialysis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hemodialysis" id="w">hemodialysis</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Hemofiltration" id="w">hemofiltration</a> may be required.</p>
<a id="Anxiety_and_sleep_disorders" name="Anxiety_and_sleep_disorders"></a><h4>Anxiety and sleep disorders</h4>
<p>Long-term overuse of caffeine can elicit a number of psychiatric disturbances. Two such disorders recognized by the <a href="/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association" id="w">American Psychiatric Association</a> (APA) are <i>caffeine-induced sleep disorder</i> and <i>caffeine-induced anxiety disorder</i>.</p>
<p>In the case of caffeine-induced <a href="/wiki/Sleep_disorder" id="w">sleep disorder</a>, an individual regularly ingests high doses of caffeine sufficient to induce a significant disturbance in his or her sleep, sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.<sup id="_ref-DSM-IV_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DSM-IV" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p>In some individuals, the large amounts of caffeine can induce <a href="/wiki/Anxiety" id="w">anxiety</a> severe enough to necessitate clinical attention. This caffeine-induced <a href="/wiki/Anxiety_disorder" id="w">anxiety disorder</a> can take many forms, from <a href="/wiki/General_anxiety_disorder" id="w">generalized anxiety</a> to <a href="/wiki/Panic_attack" id="w">panic attacks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive" id="w">obsessive-compulsive</a> symptoms, or even <a href="/wiki/Phobia" id="w">phobic symptoms</a>.<sup id="_ref-DSM-IV_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DSM-IV" title="">[71]</a></sup> Because this condition can mimic organic mental disorders, such as <a href="/wiki/Panic_disorder" id="w">panic disorder</a>, <a href="/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder" id="w">generalized anxiety disorder</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" id="w">bipolar disorder</a>, or even <a href="/wiki/Schizophrenia" id="w">schizophrenia</a>, a number of medical professionals believe caffeine-intoxicated people are routinely misdiagnosed and unnecessarily medicated when the treatment for caffeine-induced psychosis would simply be to withhold further caffeine.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> A study in the <i>British Journal of Addiction</i> concluded that caffeinism, although infrequently diagnosed, may afflict as many as one person in ten of the population.<sup id="_ref-BJoA_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BJoA" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Parkinson's_disease" name="Parkinson's_disease"></a><h2>Parkinson&#39;s disease</h2>
<p>Several large studies have shown that caffeine intake is associated with a reduced risk of developing <a href="/wiki/Parkinson%26%2339%3Bs_disease" id="w">Parkinson&#39;s disease</a> (PD) in men, but studies in women have been inconclusive.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> The mechanism by which caffeine affects PD remains a mystery.  In animal models, researchers have shown that caffeine can prevent the loss of dopamine-producing nerve cells seen in Parkinson&#39;s Disease, but researchers still do not know how this occurs.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Effects_on_memory_and_learning" name="Effects_on_memory_and_learning"></a><h2>Effects on memory and learning</h2>
<p>An array of studies found that caffeine could induce certain changes in memory and learning. However, it is still not definitely clear whether the effect is negative or positive.</p>
<p>In one study, caffeine was added to rat neurons <i><a href="/wiki/In_vitro" id="w">in vitro</a></i>. The <a href="/wiki/Dendritic_spines" id="w">dendritic spines</a> (a part of the brain cell used in forming connections between neurons) taken from the <a href="/wiki/Hippocampus" id="w">hippocampus</a> (a part of the brain associated with memory), grew by 33% and new spines formed. After an hour or two, however, these cells returned to their original shape.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another study showed that subjects&#8212;after receiving 100 milligrams of caffeine&#8212;had increased activity in brain regions located in the frontal lobe, where a part of the working memory network is located, and the <a href="/wiki/Anterior_cingulum" id="w">anterior cingulum</a>, a part of the brain that controls attention. The caffeinated subjects also performed better on the memory tasks.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, a different study showed that caffeine could impair short term memory and increase the likelihood of the <a href="/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue" id="w">tip of the tongue</a> phenomenon. The study allowed the researchers to suggest that caffeine could aid short-term memory when the information to be recalled is related to the current <a href="/wiki/Train_of_thought" id="w">train of thought</a>, but also to hypothesize that caffeine hinders short-term memory when the train of thought is unrelated.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> In essence, focused thought coupled with caffeine consumption increases mental performance.</p>
<a id="Effects_on_the_heart" name="Effects_on_the_heart"></a><h2>Effects on the heart</h2>

<p>Caffeine increases the levels of cAMP in the heart cells, mimicking the effects of epinephrine. cAMP diffuses through the cell and acts as a &#34;secondary messenger,&#34; activating protein kinase A (PKA; <a href="/wiki/CAMP-dependent_protein_kinase" id="w">cAMP-dependent protein kinase</a>). According to one study, caffeine, in the form of coffee, significantly reduces the risk of <a href="/wiki/Heart_disease" id="w">heart disease</a> in epidemiological studies. However, the protective effect was found only in participants who were not severely <a href="/wiki/Hypertensive" id="w">hypertensive</a> (i.e. patients that are not suffering from a very high blood pressure). Furthermore, no significant protective effect was found in participants aged less than 65 years or in <a href="/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease" id="w">cerebrovascular disease</a> mortality for those aged equal or more than 65 years.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Effects_on_children" name="Effects_on_children"></a><h2>Effects on children</h2>

<p>It is commonly believed that caffeine consumption causes stunted growth in children, but this is not supported by scientific research.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> However, just as with adults, there is legitimate reason to limit the amount consumed by children.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Caffeine_intake_during_pregnancy" name="Caffeine_intake_during_pregnancy"></a><h2>Caffeine intake during pregnancy</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency" id="w">Food Standards Agency</a> has recommended that pregnant women should limit their caffeine intake to less than 300 mg of caffeine a day – the equivalent of four cups of coffee a day. A higher intake may be associated with miscarriage.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>

<p>Pure caffeine is a white powder, and can be extracted from a variety of natural sources. Caffeine extraction is an important industrial process and can be performed using a number of different solvents. <a href="/wiki/Benzene" id="w">Benzene</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chloroform" id="w">chloroform</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trichloroethylene" id="w">trichloroethylene</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dichloromethane" id="w">dichloromethane</a> have all been used over the years but for reasons of safety, environmental impact, cost and flavor, they have been superseded by the following main methods:</p>
<a id="Water_extraction" name="Water_extraction"></a><h2>Water extraction</h2>
<p>Coffee beans are soaked in water. The water, which contains not only caffeine but also many other compounds which contribute to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through <a href="/wiki/Activated_carbon" id="w">activated charcoal</a>, which removes the caffeine. The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with a good flavor.<sup id="_ref-Decaffeination_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Decaffeination" title="">[82]</a></sup>  Coffee manufacturers recover the caffeine and resell it for use in soft drinks and over-the-counter <a href="/wiki/Caffeine_tablets" id="w">caffeine tablets</a>.</p>
<a id="Supercritical_carbon_dioxide_extraction" name="Supercritical_carbon_dioxide_extraction"></a><h2>Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Supercritical_carbon_dioxide" id="w">Supercritical carbon dioxide</a> is an excellent nonpolar solvent for caffeine (as well as many other organic compounds), and is safer than the organic solvents that are used for caffeine extraction. The extraction process is simple: CO<sub>2</sub> is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1&#160;°C and pressures above 73&#160;<a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit)" id="w">atm</a>. Under these conditions, CO<sub>2</sub> is in a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Supercritical_fluid" id="w">supercritical</a>&#34; <a href="/wiki/Phase_(matter)" id="w">state</a>: it has gaslike properties which allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties which dissolve 97–99% of the caffeine. The caffeine-laden CO<sub>2</sub> is then sprayed with high pressure water to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated by <a href="/wiki/Activated_carbon" id="w">charcoal adsorption</a> (as above) or by <a href="/wiki/Distillation" id="w">distillation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Recrystallization" id="w">recrystallization</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Reverse_osmosis" id="w">reverse osmosis</a>.<sup id="_ref-Decaffeination_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Decaffeination" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Extraction_by_nonhazardous_organic_solvents" name="Extraction_by_nonhazardous_organic_solvents"></a><h2>Extraction by nonhazardous organic solvents</h2>
<p>Organic solvents such as <a href="/wiki/Ethyl_acetate" id="w">ethyl acetate</a> present much less health and environmental hazard than previously used chlorinated and aromatic solvents. The hydrolysis products of ethyl acetate are <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" id="w">ethanol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Acetic_acid" id="w">acetic acid</a>, both nonhazardous in small quantities. Another method is to use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee grounds.</p>
