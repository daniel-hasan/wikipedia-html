She is the first female District Attorney to be elected in San Francisco, the first <a href="/wiki/African_American" id="w">African American</a> elected as District Attorney in <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>, and the first <a href="/wiki/Indian_American" id="w">Indian American</a> elected to the position in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. She was elected in December 2003 with over 56 percent of the votes in a run-off election against the two-term incumbent, <a href="/wiki/Terence_Hallinan" id="w">Terence Hallinan</a>.</p>
<p>Harris attended <a href="/wiki/Howard_University" id="w">Howard University</a> in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a> and received a <a href="/wiki/Juris_Doctor" id="w">J.D.</a> from <a href="/wiki/University_of_California%2C_Hastings_College_of_the_Law" id="w">University of California, Hastings College of the Law</a> in 1990.  She is the daughter of an Indian American mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan, who emigrated to the United States in 1960, and a <a href="/wiki/Jamaican_American" id="w">Jamaican American</a> father, <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" id="w">Stanford University</a> economics professor Donald Harris. </p>
<p>Harris served as Deputy District Attorney in <a href="/wiki/Alameda_County" id="w">Alameda County</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a> from 1990 to 1998. She then became Managing Attorney of the Career Criminal Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney&#39;s Office.  In 2000, San Francisco City Attorney <a href="/wiki/Louise_Renne" id="w">Louise Renne</a> recruited her to join the her office, where she was Chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division, which oversees civil <a href="/wiki/Code_enforcement" id="w">code enforcement</a> matters.  </p>
<p>In 2004, The <a href="/wiki/National_Urban_League" id="w">National Urban League</a> honored Harris as a &#34;Woman of Power&#34; and she received the Thurgood Marshall Award from the National Black Prosecutors Association in 2005.  The <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Daily_Journal" id="w">Los Angeles Daily Journal</a> recognized Harris as one of the top 100 lawyers in California. Additionally, she has served on the boards of several community organizations.</p>
<p>In April 2004, when police officer Isaac Espinoza was gunned down in the Bayview district, Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing, a decision which triggered protests from police officers and some citizens.  Others were very supportive of the decision in a community where <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment" id="w">capital punishment</a> is overwhelmingly opposed.  Harris had made a campaign promise that she would not seek the death penalty if elected.  Attorney General <a href="/wiki/Bill_Lockyer" id="w">Bill Lockyer</a> even threatened to intervene on behalf of the State of California to take the case out of Harris&#39; jurisdiction.  In the end, he ruled that Harris had acted within her legal authority.  </p>

<p>Harris is running unopposed for re-election in 2007. She has received acclaim for increasing conviction rates and the overall professionalism of the office, but has also been criticized in the face of continuing poor relations with police and rising violent crime rates.</p>
