<a id="Career" name="Career"></a><h3>Career</h3>
<p>Marie McDonald&#39;s singing voice brought work with <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Dorsey" id="w">Tommy Dorsey</a> &#38; His Orchestra on his radio show and she later performed with other <a href="/wiki/Big_band" id="w">Big bands</a>. Seen as a multi-talented young star, in <a href="/wiki/1942_in_film" id="w">1942</a> she was put under contract by <a href="/wiki/Universal_Studios" id="w">Universal Studios</a> and immediately appeared in several minor roles. The following year she co-starred in <i>A Scream in the Dark</i>, a <a href="/wiki/B_movies" id="w">&#34;B&#34;</a> detective mystery for <a href="/wiki/Republic_Pictures" id="w">Republic Pictures</a> that met with reasonable success. However, that would be it as far as starring roles until 1945 when she worked for a small independent production company in another &#34;B&#34; film called <i>Getting Gertie&#39;s Garter</i>. She costarred with <a href="/wiki/Gene_Kelly" id="w">Gene Kelly</a> in <a href="/wiki/MGM" id="w">MGM</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Living_in_a_Big_Way" id="w">Living in a Big Way</a></i> (1947).</p>

During the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a>, McDonald was a volunteer <a href="/wiki/Pin-up_girl" id="w">pin-up girl</a> for the <a href="/wiki/United_States_military" id="w">United States military</a> magazine, <i><a href="/wiki/YANK" id="w">YANK</a></i>. She had married for the first time in 1940 but this marriage quickly ended. Her second marriage, to her agent Vic Orsatti, lasted four years. In all, she married seven times, including twice to Harry Karl, who later married and bankrupted <a href="/wiki/Debbie_Reynolds" id="w">Debbie Reynolds</a>. She also had a torrid affair with gangster <a href="/wiki/Bugsy_Siegel" id="w">Bugsy Siegel</a>. </p>
<p>Her personal life was thrown into turmoil by her addictions to alcohol and prescription drugs. She was arrested for drunk driving and later attempted suicide. In 1957, she made headlines by faking her own kidnapping. Between <a href="/wiki/1945_in_film" id="w">1945</a> and <a href="/wiki/1950_in_film" id="w">1950</a> she appeared in only two films and then again not until <a href="/wiki/1958_in_film" id="w">1958</a> when she was cast in a <a href="/wiki/Slapstick_comedy" id="w">slapstick comedy</a> opposite <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Lewis" id="w">Jerry Lewis</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Geisha_Boy" id="w">The Geisha Boy</a></i> . Eight years later the 40-year-old McDonald made her last appearance in a &#34;spicy&#34; film, <i><a href="/wiki/Promises!_Promises!" id="w">Promises! Promises!</a></i>, that featured a topless <a href="/wiki/Jayne_Mansfield" id="w">Jayne Mansfield</a>.</p>
<a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h3>Death</h3>
<p>In 1965, at <a href="/wiki/Calabasas%2C_California" id="w">Calabasas, California</a>, the 42-year-old ended her own life with a <a href="/wiki/Drug_overdose" id="w">drug overdose</a>. She was put to rest in the <a href="/wiki/Forest_Lawn_Memorial_Park%2C_Glendale" id="w">Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery</a> in <a href="/wiki/Glendale%2C_California" id="w">Glendale, California</a> with her last husband, Donald F. Taylor. It is unclear whether McDonald committed suicide or whether her death was accidental. Her husband committed suicide in January 1966. Marie&#39;s three children were raised by Harry Karl and his new wife, Debbie Reynolds.</p>
