<p><b>Tzaraath</b> (<i>tzaraas</i>, <i>tzaraat</i>, <i>tsaraas</i>, <i>tsaraat</i>; <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language" id="w">Hebrew</a> צרעת) is a skin condition named by the <a href="/wiki/Masoretic_text" id="w">masoretic text</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Priestly_Code" id="w">Priestly Code</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Tanakh" id="w">Tanakh</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>; <i>tzaraath</i> is translated by the <a href="/wiki/Septuagint" id="w">Septuagint</a> as <i>lepra</i>, and was consequently translated by older <a href="/wiki/English_translations_of_the_Bible" id="w">English translations of the Bible</a> as <i><a href="/wiki/Leprosy" id="w">leprosy</a></i>, with which <i>lepra</i> is <a href="/wiki/Cognate" id="w">cognate</a>. Several of the symptoms mentioned by the biblical text are inconsistent with <i>tzaraath</i> being leprosy, and additionally, the most obvious features of leprosy - the strong disfigurement of the face due to its swelling, and the rotting of limbs - are unmentioned in the description of <i>tzaraath</i>.</p>
<p>In Ancient Greece, <i>lepra</i>, which means <i>rough</i>/<i>scaly</i>, was used to refer to <a href="/wiki/Psoriasis" id="w">psoriasis</a> rather than the condition now called <i>leprosy</i>, which the Ancient Greeks referred to as <i>elephas</i> and <i>elephantiasis</i><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>. The <a href="/wiki/Root_word" id="w">linguistic root</a> of <i>tzaraath</i> means <i>smiting</i>, apparently in reference to a theological explanation of its cause as a punishment for <a href="/wiki/Sin" id="w">sin</a><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>; it is quite possible that <i>tzaraath</i> was a general term for certain types of skin disease, rather than a particular condition<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>, and the <a href="/wiki/Talmud" id="w">Talmud</a> maintains a similar view, arguing that <i>tzaraath</i> referred generally to any disease that produces sores and eruptions on the skin<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The biblical description of <i>tzaraath</i> is under the impression that it could also afflict clothes<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> and houses<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>, not just skin, which is not true of leprosy, and not true of psoriasis either; <a href="/wiki/Textual_criticism" id="w">Textual scholars</a> regard the Priestly Code to have been compiled from several earlier independent documents, and the regulations for house <i>tzaraath</i>, for fabric <i>tzaraath</i>, and for skin <i>tzaraath</i> are considered by textual scholars to have once been independent of each other<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<a id="Biblical_Symptoms" name="Biblical_Symptoms"></a><h2>Biblical Symptoms</h2>

<a id="In_the_skin" name="In_the_skin"></a><h3>In the skin</h3>

<p>The priestly code specifies three different manifestations of <i>tzaraath</i> in the skin:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Whitening of the skin over the whole body with sores<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Spreading of sores, swellings which are white, or spots which are reddish-white<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Patches on the skin which are clearly suffering from <a href="/wiki/Subcutaneous" id="w">subcutaneous</a> disease, where the hair has turned white, and which contain sores, swellings which are white, or spots which are reddish-white<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>.</li></ul>
<p>In the case of non-subcutaneous infections without the hair whitening, the text specifies a mechanism for detecting whether spreading has occurred. When the symptoms are detected, the code requires the individual to be <a href="/wiki/Isolation" id="w">isolated</a> for 7 days, and then checked for the spread of disease<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup>; in the case of sores, if spreading isn&#39;t witnessed after the first 7 days of isolation, the individual must be isolated for another 7 days, and then checked again<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>. If sores occur on the head or chin, then the individual is required to shave themselves everywhere except where the sores occur, between the first week of isolation and the second week<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The biblical text also provides rules that differentiate between <i>tzaraath</i> and other historically common skin diseases. When the symptoms include swellings or spots, the text only specifies that <i>tzaraath</i> is present if the swellings/spots occur in locations where a <a href="/wiki/Burn_(injury)" id="w">burn injury</a> exists<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup>, or where a <a href="/wiki/Boil" id="w">boil</a> had previously healed<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup>; in the latter case, if there is also spreading of the condition around the skin, it is considered by the text to be symptomatic of <i>plague</i> rather than <i>tzaraath</i><sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup>. The text also differentiates between general sores, and those present on the head or chin, and in the latter case, the text states that if the sores spread, <i>tzaraath</i> only exists if hair growing in the sores is a <a href="/wiki/Colour" id="w">colour</a> other than black<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>; the Talmud argues that if the <a href="/wiki/Head_hair" id="w">head hair</a> and <a href="/wiki/Facial_hair" id="w">facial hair</a> has fallen out, then sores on the head or chin should be regarded like those elsewhere on the body, implying that the biblical differentiation between the locations was due to the presence of this hair in these regions<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup>.</p>
<a id="Interpretations" name="Interpretations"></a><h4> Interpretations </h4>

<p>Rather than following the biblical descriptions of the symptoms of <i>tzaraath</i> in the manner than modern doctors would, <a href="/wiki/Classical_rabbinical_literature" id="w">classical rabbinical literature</a> took an extremely literal view<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup>. In the group of symptoms where the hair of the inflicted region has turned white, the <a href="/wiki/Mishnah" id="w">Mishnah</a> argues that plucking out the white hair was all that was required for the disease not to be considered <i>tzaraath</i><sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>; similarly since the biblical text mentions <i>tzaraath</i> occurring where boils had previously healed, but not where unhealed boils exist, the Mishnah maintains that the appearance of the other symptoms in an unhealed boil or burn do not indicate <i>tzaraath</i>, and that if the boil/burn does subsequently heal it still wouldn&#39;t indicate leprosy unless the other symptoms occur in parts of the body that were not previously diseased<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup>. The Mishnah also argues that sores smaller than the size of a <a href="/wiki/Lentil" id="w">lentil</a>, those on the extremities of the body (such as the fingers, toes, ears, nose, breasts, etc.), those which occur in the location of an unhealed boil or burn, and those which occur in hairy parts of the body, do not indicate <i>tzaraath</i><sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup>.</p>

Scholars suspect that these descriptions of <i>tzaraath</i>, where it applies to skin conditions, actually refer to a number of different <a href="/wiki/Dermatology" id="w">skin diseases</a><sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup>, which, owing to the undeveloped state of medical science at that period, were not distinguished<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup>. Of the particular situations that the Priestly Code describes as being <i>tzaraath</i>,
</p>
<ul>
<li>the whitening of the skin over the whole body with sores, is considered by scholars to be most indicative of Psoriasis (the sores arising from complications due to <a href="/wiki/Eczema" id="w">eczema</a>)<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></li>
<li>the spreading of sores is regarded by scholars as most symptomatic of <a href="/wiki/Impetigo" id="w">Impetigo</a><sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></li>
<li>the spreading of swellings or spots in a burn injury, according to scholars, is most probably a result of <a href="/wiki/Erysipelas" id="w">Erysipelas</a><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></li>
<li>in regard to subcutaneous disease where the hair has turned white
<ul>
<li>the additional presence of swellings or spots in a burn injury are thought by scholars most likely to be <a href="/wiki/Cutaneous_leishmaniasis" id="w">Tropical Sores</a><sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></li>
<li>the additional presence of bodily sores, and swellings or spots where there previously had been a boil, is one of the classical symptoms of Leprosy<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></li>
<li>the additional presence of sores on the head or chin is thought by scholars to most probably indicate the presence of <a href="/wiki/Ringworm" id="w">Ringworm</a><sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></li></ul></li></ul>
<a id="Symptoms_of_other_conditions" name="Symptoms_of_other_conditions"></a><h4>Symptoms of other conditions</h4>

<p>In addition to simple <a href="/wiki/Rash" id="w">rashes</a><sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup>, <a href="/wiki/Inflammation" id="w">inflammations</a><sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup>, and <a href="/wiki/Swelling_(medical)" id="w">swellings</a><sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup>, the biblical text mentions a number of other conditions that could be confused with <i>tzaraath</i>. Among the other situations which the text considers harmless are the appearance of dull white spots<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup>, white patches of skin without sores<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup>, and baldness without sores<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup>; the latter two of these are thought by scholars to most probably refer to <a href="/wiki/Vitiligo" id="w">vitiligo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alopecia" id="w">alopecia</a>, respectively<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup>, and the bible remarks that the former - the dull white spots - are merely a form of <a href="/wiki/Freckles" id="w">freckles</a><sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup>. The symptoms that the text considers to be indicative of disease include those of the spread of superficial swellings or spots (where there had previously been a boil)<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup>, and those of reddish-white sores in areas of baldness<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup>; the former condition is identified by the bible as <i>plague</i>, and scholars regard its symptoms as pointing to a <a href="/wiki/Diagnosis" id="w">diagnosis</a> of <a href="/wiki/Smallpox" id="w">smallpox</a><sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup>, while the latter is unidentified in the biblical text, but considered by scholars to indicate <a href="/wiki/Favus" id="w">favus</a><sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup>.</p>
<a id="In_clothing_fabrics" name="In_clothing_fabrics"></a><h3> In clothing fabrics </h3>
<p>In addition to infecting the skin, <i>tzaraath</i> is described by the priestly code as being able to infect historically common clothing fabrics, specifically <a href="/wiki/Wool" id="w">wool</a>, <a href="/wiki/Linen" id="w">linen</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Leather" id="w">leather</a><sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup>. The Biblical description of <i>tzaraath</i> in such fabrics is strikingly analogous to that of <i>tzaraath</i> in the skin<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup>, with, for example, spreading of the infection being tested for by isolating the fabric in question for first 7 days<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup>. The principle symptoms are described as being very green or very red spots<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup>, which spread within a week<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup>, or which don&#39;t change appearance at all after a fortnight, having been washed after the first week<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup>, or which return a week after having been torn out, if they also had faded with washing prior to being torn out<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup>. These descriptions are regarded by scholars as most probably indicative of certain <a href="/wiki/Mould" id="w">moulds</a><sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup>, and especially matching infections by <a href="/wiki/Penicillium" id="w">Penicillium</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Fungus" id="w">fungus</a> which produces <a href="/wiki/Penicillin" id="w">penicillin</a>)<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup></p>

The biblical text also describes <i>tzaraath</i> as infecting the walls of houses<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup>; the symptoms it describes are depressions in the wall, which are very green or very red<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup>, and which spread over a period of seven days<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup>. The description is regarded by scholars as again being strikingly similar to the wording of the description of <i>tzaraath</i> infections in the skin<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup>, but still somewhat obscure<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup>; it would seem to fit some form of fungal growth<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup>, especially <a href="/wiki/Dry_rot" id="w">dry rot</a>, which produces yellowish-green and reddish patches on walls<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup>. </p>
<a id="Cause_and_Treatment" name="Cause_and_Treatment"></a><h2>Cause and Treatment</h2>

<p>Although the medical and chemical conditions, which scholars consider the descriptions to fit, have obvious <a href="/wiki/Pathology" id="w">natural causes</a> in the light of modern scientific knowledge, the biblical texts characterise it as a spiritual affliction with a supernatural cause, bringing <a href="/wiki/Ritual_impurity" id="w">ritual impurity</a> to its victims. Each victim of <i>tzaraas</i> mentioned by the Bible is stated to have received the condition due to some transgression of biblical laws<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup>, including <a href="/wiki/Joab" id="w">Joab</a> being cursed for the murder of <a href="/wiki/Abner" id="w">Abner</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gehazi" id="w">Gehazi</a> for being covetous, and <a href="/wiki/Uzziah" id="w">Uzziah</a> for infringing the exclusive rights of certain people to burn incense. </p>
<p>If a person was afflicted with <i>tzaraath</i> in their skin, they were required to wear torn clothes, keep their hair unkempt, cover the lower part of their face, cry out <i>[ritually] impure, [ritually] impure</i>, and reside away from other people<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup>; a few <a href="/wiki/Medical_history" id="w">medical historians</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Arturo_Castiglioni" id="w">Arturo Castiglioni</a>, regard this as the first model of sanitary legislation<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup>. Nevertheless, this isolation isn&#39;t necessarily due to concerns over the contagiousness of the disease, but rather due to concerns about the risk of moral corruption to other people; the Talmud doesn&#39;t treat <i>tzaraath</i> as contagious<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup>, and doesn&#39;t consider non-Jewish victims of <i>tzaraath</i> to be ritually impure<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup>. The Talmud states that if <i>tzaraath</i> hadn&#39;t been confirmed by a <a href="/wiki/Kohen" id="w">Jewish priest</a>, then a <a href="/wiki/Bridegroom" id="w">bridegroom</a> with suspected symptoms of it was allowed to postpone any isolation or inspection by a priest until a week after his <a href="/wiki/Jewish_wedding" id="w">wedding</a>, and if a person developed suspected symptoms of <i>tzaraath</i> during a <a href="/wiki/Jewish_holiday" id="w">holy day</a>, then the isolation and inspection by a priest could be postponed until the holy days had finished<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Fabrics and clothing affected by <i>tzaraath</i> were required by the text to be burnt entirely<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup>, unless it was the form of <i>tzaraath</i> which faded after washing but came back after being torn out, in which case it could be considered <i>ritually pure</i> as soon as the <i>tzaraath</i> had gone, and it had subsequently been washed<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup>. <i>Tzaraath</i> infections in houses were to be treated similarly harshly according to the biblical regulations, and didn&#39;t have any exceptions; stones showing the symptoms had to be removed, and the house had to be scraped, with the removed stones and scraped-off clay being cast into a rubbish heap outside the city<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup>, and if the infection returned once replacement stones were laid and daubed with clay, then the whole house had to be dismantled, with the rubble again going to the tip outside the city<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup>. Additionally, people who had been in a house while it was infected with <i>tzaraath</i> was considered ritually impure until the evening came, and anyone who had eaten or slept there had to also wash their clothes<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Talmud, and the majority of historic Jewish literature in general, regards <i>tzaraath</i> as a <a href="/wiki/Punishment" id="w">punishment</a> for <a href="/wiki/Sin" id="w">sin</a>; it lists seven possible causes for <i>tzaraath</i><sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>an <i><a href="/wiki/Lashon_hara" id="w">evil tongue</a></i> (malicious <a href="/wiki/Gossip" id="w">gossip</a>)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Murder" id="w">murder</a></li>
<li>a vain <a href="/wiki/Oath" id="w">oath</a></li>
<li>illicit <a href="/wiki/Sexual_intercourse" id="w">sexual intercourse</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Pride" id="w">pride</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Theft" id="w">theft</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Miser" id="w">miserly</a> behaviour</li></ul>
<p>One <i><a href="/wiki/Midrash" id="w">midrashic</a></i> source categorically states that <i>tzaraath</i> only appeared as punishment for <i>evil tongue</i>, while others add further reasons to the list in the Talmud. Unlike the modern medical approach, which seeks to cure by natural means, the classical Jewish sources argue that cure from <i>tzaraath</i> only came about through <a href="/wiki/Repentance_in_Judaism" id="w">repentance</a> and forgiveness. In particular, the <a href="/wiki/Rabbah" id="w">Midrash Rabbah</a> sees the different types of <i>tzaraath</i> as increasing levels of punishment, which could be curtailed at any stage if repentance was made:
</p>
<ol>
<li>the first stage in the Rabbah&#39;s view was the infection of homes, and if repentance came here it would only require the removal of the affected stones for a cure,</li>
<li>in the second stage, the entire house must be torn down as the <i>tzaraath</i> would not go away, and the infection came upon one&#39;s clothes; if repentance came here it required only washing of the clothes for a cure</li>
<li>in the third stage of Rabbah&#39;s scheme, the clothes must be burnt, and the infection enters the person&#39;s skin; if repentance occurs here then purification could occur</li>
<li>in the fourth stage, which only occurs when the person has completely refused to repent, the person is forced to <i>dwell alone</i></li></ol>
<p>Other <a href="/wiki/Classical_rabbinical_literature" id="w">classical rabbinical writers</a> saw <i>tzaraath</i> infections of houses as having a practical benefit. According to one, as well as being a punishment for miserlyness, it also demonstrated that the house owner was lying, if they had said they did not own certain objects which neighbours had asked to borrow, since the biblical regulations require the house owner to take all their possessions outside until the infection is cured<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup>. On the other hand, <a href="/wiki/Rashi" id="w">Rashi</a>, basing his view on the <a href="/wiki/Leviticus_Rabbah" id="w">Leviticus Rabbah</a><sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup>, states that <i>tzaraath</i> infecting houses was a reward for the home owner, arguing that the <a href="/wiki/Israelite" id="w">Israelite</a> homes had previously been those of <a href="/wiki/Canaanites" id="w">Canaanites</a>, who had hidden their golden valuables in the walls; the <i>tzaraath</i> infection would require the house owner to remove the bricks, and so find the treasures hidden there<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>When the priest had certified that <i>tzaraath</i> had been cured, the biblical text requires that the formerly infected person undergo a number of ritual events<sup id="_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#_note-96" title="">[96]</a></sup>, some occurring straight away<sup id="_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#_note-97" title="">[97]</a></sup>, and some occurring a week later<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup>. According to textual scholars, these are really two independent rituals spliced together, with the first group<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup> being the ritual that was originally part of the regulations for <i>tzaraath</i> of skin, and the other group<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup> being a later attempt at replacing the first group of rituals, so that the regulations fitted better with the sacrifice-centric view of the Aaronid priesthood<sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[101]</a></sup>. The biblical text states that a ritual, almost identical to the first group of rituals for skin-<i>tzaraath</i>, also had to be carried out for houses that had been cured of infections from <i>tzaraath</i><sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup>; however, there is no further ritual for houses that could parallel the second group of rituals for skin-<i>tzaraath</i>.</p>
<p>The first group of requirements are that the formerly infected person kills a (ritually pure) bird over fresh water, in a clay pot, and dips another living bird, together with cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and <a href="/wiki/Ezob" id="w">ezob</a>, into the blood<sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[103]</a></sup>; this combination was used to sprinkle the formerly infected person seven times with the blood<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[104]</a></sup>. Once the surviving bird was released over open fields<sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup>, and the formerly infected person had shaved off all their hair, and bathed themselves and their clothes in water, they were counted as ritually pure<sup id="_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#_note-106" title="">[106]</a></sup>. According to biblical scholars, this ritual is primarily an example of <a href="/wiki/Sympathetic_magic" id="w">sympathetic magic</a>, with the running water and living bird being symbolic representations of ritual impurity going away<sup id="_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#_note-107" title="">[107]</a></sup>; killing animals over running water was a widespread ancient custom<sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[108]</a></sup>. The cedar and ezob have more practical applications, with cedarwood having medicinal properties, and ezob being a good implement to use for sprinkling with<sup id="_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#_note-109" title="">[109]</a></sup>. </p>
<p>In the second group of requirements, having completed the first group, the formerly infected person is required to avoid their own home for a week (although they may mix with other people)<sup id="_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#_note-110" title="">[110]</a></sup>, after which they must shave off absolutely all of their hair, including their <a href="/wiki/Eyebrow" id="w">eyebrows</a>, and then wash themselves<sup id="_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#_note-111" title="">[111]</a></sup>. Having done this, the formerly infected individual was required to make a standard <a href="/wiki/Whole_offering" id="w">whole offering</a>, a standard <a href="/wiki/Sin_offering" id="w">sin offering</a> (to excuse the profanity of having had <i>tzaraath</i><sup id="_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#_note-112" title="">[112]</a></sup>), and a <a href="/wiki/Guilt_offering" id="w">guilt offering</a> (to apologise for the cause of the <i>tzaraath</i><sup id="_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#_note-113" title="">[113]</a></sup>)<sup id="_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#_note-114" title="">[114]</a></sup>; if people are too <a href="/wiki/Poverty" id="w">poor</a> to afford that, the bible allows the standard alternative set of sacrificial victims to be used instead<sup id="_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#_note-115" title="">[115]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Unlike other guilt offerings, the priest was required to put some of the blood from the sacrifice onto the formerly infected person&#39;s right ear lobe, right <a href="/wiki/Thumb" id="w">thumb</a>, and right big <a href="/wiki/Toe" id="w">toe</a><sup id="_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#_note-116" title="">[116]</a></sup>, then some of the oil for the sacrifice had to be poured into the priest&#39;s left palm, and applied with the priest&#39;s right forefinger onto to the formerly infected person&#39;s right ear lobe, right thumb, and right big toe<sup id="_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#_note-117" title="">[117]</a></sup>, and then the rest of the oil from the priest&#39;s palm was to be poured onto the formerly infected person&#39;s head<sup id="_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#_note-118" title="">[118]</a></sup>; textual scholars regard the Priestly Code, of which the <i>tzaraath</i> regulations are a part, to have been written in the early 7th century<sup id="_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#_note-119" title="">[119]</a></sup>, and it is in this context that these additional rules have significance. By that era, non-priests were not allowed to pass beyond a certain gateway (the gate of Nicenor) in the complex at the <a href="/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem" id="w">Temple in Jerusalem</a>, while the blood from sacrifices couldn&#39;t pass outside, thus for a person to be touched by the blood, they had to lean through the gateway without setting foot on the other side; the right ear, thumb, and toe, were symbolically the parts of the body which achieve this<sup id="_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#_note-120" title="">[120]</a></sup>.</p>
