<a id="Educational_background_and_career" name="Educational_background_and_career"></a><h1> Educational background and career </h1>
<p>Clare attended the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.kingsbrook.northants.sch.uk/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.kingsbrook.northants.sch.uk/">Kingsbrook School</a>, in Milton Keynes. After obtaining A-levels in Mathematics, Geography and History in 1988, she studied at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Plymouth" id="w">University of Plymouth</a> and graduated with an <a href="/wiki/Honours_degree" id="w">honours degree</a> in <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" id="w">Mathematics</a>, continuing on with her <a href="/wiki/Masters_degree" id="w">masters degree</a> in Applied <a href="/wiki/Marine_Sciences" id="w">Marine Sciences</a>. She then began her training at the <a href="/wiki/Met_Office" id="w">Met Office</a> to become a qualified <a href="/wiki/Weather_forecaster" id="w">weather forecaster</a>.</p>
<p>Two years later, Clare joined the London Weather Centre, offering weather forecasting and presenting services to <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> <a href="/wiki/Radio_stations" id="w">radio stations</a> and media outlets. Subsequently, she took a position as forecaster and presenter for <a href="/wiki/Anglia_Television" id="w">Anglia Television</a>.</p>
<p>She returned to London to work for <a href="/wiki/Carlton_Television" id="w">Carlton Television</a> in 1998, spending almost two years before taking a position with <a href="/wiki/GMTV" id="w">GMTV</a>.</p>
<p>In 2001 she was made weather producer and presenter, being responsible for all weather output and weather-related features on GMTV.</p>
<p>She also reports from worldwide field locations on meteorological issues and items of correlative interest.  Probably her most famous TV moment, and one which has often been re-shown, saw her reporting from a seafront which was being lashed by wind and rain.  In the middle of her report, an enormous wave burst over the harbour wall, completely covering her and sending her flying out of shot.  Undeterred, she picked herself up and finished her report, having to speak directly into the boom microphone as she had lost her microphone pack.</p>
<p>In addition to presenting the weather on GMTV, Clare hosted several series, including &#34;Interactive Wedding&#34;, the travel series &#34;Great Escapes&#34;, and &#34;Extreme Weather&#34;, wherein she investigated globally changing weather patterns.</p>
