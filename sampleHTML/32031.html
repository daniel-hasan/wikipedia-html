The main campus is located less than a mile from the <a href="/wiki/Texas_State_Capitol" id="w">Texas State Capitol</a> in Austin. According to <i>The Public Ivies: America&#39;s Flagship Public Universities</i> (2001) by Howard and Matthew Greene, The University of Texas at Austin is one of America&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/Public_Ivy" id="w">Public Ivy</a>&#34; institutions of higher education, defined by the authors as a public institution that &#34;provides an Ivy League collegiate experience at a public school price.&#34; Founded in 1883, the university has had <a href="/wiki/List_of_largest_United_States_universities_by_enrollment" id="w">the fifth largest</a> single-campus enrollment in the nation as of fall 2006 (and had the largest enrollment in the country from 1997&#8211;2003), with nearly 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and 16,500 faculty and staff.<sup id="_ref-EnrEss_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EnrEss" title="">[6]</a></sup> It currently holds the largest enrollment of all colleges in the state of Texas. </p>
<p>The university also operates various auxiliary facilities aside from the main campus, most notably the <a href="/wiki/J._J._Pickle_Research_Campus" id="w">J. J. Pickle Research Campus</a>. Texas is a major center for academic research, annually exceeding $380 million in funding. In addition, the university&#39;s athletic programs were recognized by <i><a href="/wiki/Sports_Illustrated" id="w">Sports Illustrated</a>,</i> which dubbed UT &#34;America&#39;s Best Sports College&#34; in 2002.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The first mention of a public university in <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a> can be traced to the 1827 constitution for the <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexican</a> state of <a href="/wiki/Coahuila_y_Tejas" id="w">Coahuila y Tejas</a>. Although an article promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, no action was ever taken by the Mexican government. After Texas obtained its independence from Mexico in 1836, the Congress of Texas adopted the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Republic_of_Texas" id="w">Constitution of the Republic</a>, which included a provision to establish public education in <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Texas" id="w">republic</a>, including two universities or colleges. On <a href="/wiki/January_26" id="w">January 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1839" id="w">1839</a>, Congress agreed to eventually set aside fifty <a href="/wiki/League_(unit)" id="w">leagues</a> of land towards the effort; in addition, forty acres in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated &#34;College Hill.&#34;

In 1846, Texas was annexed into the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. The state legislature passed the <a href="/wiki/Act_of_1858" id="w">Act of 1858</a>, which set aside $100,000 in United States <a href="/wiki/Bond_(finance)" id="w">bonds</a> towards construction. In addition, the legislature designated land, previously reserved for the encouragement of railroad construction, toward the universities&#39; fifty leagues. However, Texas&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Secession" id="w">secession</a> from the Union and the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a> prevented further action on these plans.</p>
<p>The passing of the <a href="/wiki/Morrill_Land-Grant_Colleges_Act" id="w">Morrill Act</a> in 1862 facilitated the creation of <a href="/wiki/Texas_A%26amp%3BM_University" id="w">Texas A&#38;M University</a>, which was established in 1876 as the Agricultural &#38; Mechanical College of Texas.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Texas_Constitution" id="w">Texas Constitution of 1876</a> mandated that the state establish a university &#34;at an early day,&#34; calling for the creation of a &#34;university of the first class,&#34; The University of Texas. It revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858 but appropriated one million acres (4000 km²) in West Texas. In 1883, another two million were granted, with income from the sale of land and <a href="/wiki/Grazing_rights" id="w">grazing rights</a> going to The University of Texas and Texas A&#38;M.

<p>In 1881, Austin was chosen as the site of the main university, and Galveston was designated the location of the medical department. On the original &#34;College Hill,&#34; an official ceremony began construction on what is now referred to as the old Main Building in late 1882. The university opened its doors on <a href="/wiki/September_15" id="w">September 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1883" id="w">1883</a>.</p>
<p>The old <a href="/wiki/Victorian_architecture" id="w">Victorian</a>-<a href="/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture" id="w">Gothic</a> <a href="/wiki/Main_Building_of_The_University_of_Texas_at_Austin" id="w">Main Building</a> served as the central point of the campus&#39;s forty acre site, and was used for nearly all purposes. However, by the 1930s, discussions rose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.</p>
<p>Constitutional restrictions against funding building construction hampered expansion. However, the funds generated by <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" id="w">oil</a> discovered on university-owned grounds in 1923 were put towards its general endowment fund. This extra revenue allowed the university to pay down its debt, and pass bond in 1931 and 1947, funding the necessary expansion after the enrollment spike following <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>. The university built 19 permanent structures between 1950 and 1965, when it was given the right of <a href="/wiki/Eminent_domain" id="w">eminent domain</a>. With this power, the university purchased additional properties surrounding the original forty acres.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_1" id="w">August 1</a> <a href="/wiki/1966" id="w">1966</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Whitman" id="w">Charles Whitman</a>, a former <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" id="w">U.S. marine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Architectural_engineering" id="w">architectural engineering</a> major at the university, barricaded himself on the observation deck of the tower of the Main Building with a <a href="/wiki/Remington_700" id="w">Remington 700</a> 6 mm rifle and various other weapons. In the ensuing 96-minute stand-off, Whitman killed 14 people and wounded an additional 31 before himself being killed by police who stormed the observation tower.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Later, the observation deck was closed until 1968 and closed again in 1975 following a series of <a href="/wiki/Suicide" id="w">suicide</a> jumps. During the time of the shooting, the tower was open to the public. However, in 1998, after the installation of security and safety measures, the observation deck reopened to the public available by weekend tours.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Admission" name="Admission"></a><h3>Admission</h3>

<p>As a state public university, UT is subject to <a href="/wiki/Texas_House_Bill_588" id="w">Texas House Bill 588</a> (HB 588, popularly known as the top ten percent law). HB 588 states that a Texas resident graduating in the top 10% of their senior class from an accredited Texas high school will be guaranteed <b><i>admission</i></b> when they submit a complete application by the deadline.  However, HB 588 guarantees admission into the university only; it does not guarantee acceptance into a particular major, nor does it guarantee any scholarship or other form of tuition assistance (except for those who are class <a href="/wiki/Valedictorian" id="w">valedictorian</a>; a pre-existing law guarantees full scholarship for those students).</p>
<p>Students outside of top ten percent will be reviewed holistically and compete for admission. Things that are not taken into consideration are the high school they attend and the level (AP courses, honors) of the curriculum they are taking.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Their selectivity is deemed as &#34;More selective&#34; according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup>. In fall 2006, a total of 27,315 applications were received and 13,305 were admitted.

<a id="Faculty_and_research" name="Faculty_and_research"></a><h3>Faculty and research</h3>
<p>As of 2004, the university employed 2,271 faculty members. Approximately 51.1% were <a href="/wiki/Tenure" id="w">tenured</a>, while an additional 17.8% were tenure track. The university&#39;s faculty includes winners of the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize" id="w">Nobel Prize</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize" id="w">Pulitzer Prize</a>, the <a href="/wiki/National_Medal_of_Science" id="w">National Medal of Science</a>, the <a href="/wiki/National_Medal_of_Technology" id="w">National Medal of Technology</a>, and numerous other awards. Over 1,000 faculty positions are endowed by private funds. Since 1984, more than forty $1 million-endowed chairs have been created at The University of Texas to recruit distinguished faculty and facilitate research in the sciences and engineering.</p>
<p>The university exceeds $446 million in annual research funding<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>, and its facilities house more than 90 research units. UT has earned more than 400 patents since its founding. In 2005, Texas secured $417 million in awards and grants, a new university record. In addition, Texas earned $5 million in licensing revenue and capped a six-year funding increase of 48%. The university has also reached out to establish partnerships with other facilities, including <a href="/wiki/University_of_Texas_Medical_Branch" id="w">The University of Texas Medical Branch</a> in Galveston, <a href="/wiki/University_of_Texas_Health_Science_Center_at_San_Antonio" id="w">The University of Texas Health Science Center</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson_Space_Center" id="w">Johnson Space Center</a> of <a href="/wiki/NASA" id="w">NASA</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Northwest_National_Laboratory" id="w">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a>, and the International Center for Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to research in traditional fields, scientists are pushing forward in several new, interdisciplinary areas, including nanotechnology and materials engineering for next-generation semiconductors. In addition, Texas is advancing high performance computing through the <a href="/wiki/Texas_Advanced_Computing_Center" id="w">Texas Advanced Computing Center</a> (TACC), which supports over 600 projects in the natural sciences, engineering, and business.
