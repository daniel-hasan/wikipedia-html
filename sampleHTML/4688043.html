<p><b>John Boyd Thacher II</b> (<a href="/wiki/1882-10-26" id="w">1882-10-26</a>&#8211;<a href="/wiki/1957-04-25" id="w">1957-04-25</a>) was the Mayor of <a href="/wiki/Albany%2C_New_York" id="w">Albany, New York</a> from 1926 to 1941.  He was the nephew of Albany mayor <a href="/wiki/John_Boyd_Thacher" id="w">John Boyd Thacher</a> and grandson of another Albany mayor, George H. Thacher.</p>
<p>John Boyd Thacher II was born in <a href="/wiki/Leadville%2C_Colorado" id="w">Leadville, Colorado</a> to the younger George H. Thacher (son of Mayor Thacher) and Emma Louise Bennett, who spent the early 1880s on business in Colorado.  The Thachers returned to Albany while John was a toddler and George Thacher re-established ties with his father&#39;s Albany business.  John Thacher attended <a href="/wiki/Albany_Academy" id="w">Albany Academy</a> and received a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts" id="w">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree from <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton University</a> in 1904.  He graduated with a <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Laws" id="w">Doctor of Laws</a> from <a href="/wiki/Union_College" id="w">Union College</a> in 1906 and was admitted to the New York <a href="/wiki/State_bar_association" id="w">state bar association</a>.  He practiced law in <a href="/wiki/Schoharie_County%2C_New_York" id="w">Schoharie County</a> for a year before returning to practice in Albany. He married Lulu Abel Cameron of Middle Bridge on June 17, 1918. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> interrupted Thacher&#39;s law practice when he saw action in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Corps" id="w">Air corps</a> and <a href="/wiki/American_Field_Service" id="w">Ambulance corps</a>, with a considerable amount of his time spent in <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>.  Thacher then ventured into Albany government, becoming a member of the Common Council of Albany as well as city <a href="/wiki/Treasurer" id="w">treasurer</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/1926-03-04" id="w">1926-03-04</a>, Albany mayor William S. Hackett was killed in a car accident in <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.albany.edu/history/HIS530/democraticparty/1921election.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.albany.edu/history/HIS530/democraticparty/1921election.html">http://www.albany.edu/history/HIS530/democraticparty/1921election.html</a>.  John Boyd Thacher II was named as his temporary successor.  That November, he was officially elected mayor in a landslide.  Thacher was subsequently reelected as Mayor in 1929, 1933 and 1937. In 1932, he was nominated as a Democratic candidate for Governor of New York, but yielded to <a href="/wiki/Herbert_H._Lehman" id="w">Herbert H. Lehman</a>, who was elected. </p>
<p>Thacher resigned from his position as Mayor in 1940 to become Judge of Albany County&#39;s Children&#39;s Court, a position he held until 1947. A long-term advocate for education and children&#39;s rights, he was also instrumental in developing the summer camp that came to bear his name: Camp Thacher. </p>
<p>Upon Thacher&#39;s resignation as Mayor, President of the Common Council Herman F. Hoogkamp was appointed acting Mayor in 1940 and served out the remainder of Thacher&#39;s term. In 1941, <a href="/wiki/Erastus_Corning_II" id="w">Erastus Corning II</a> was elected mayor; Corning served for over 40 years until his death in 1983.</p>
<p>John Boyd Thacher II died in 1957 in Albany, and is interred in <a href="/wiki/Albany_Rural_Cemetery" id="w">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>.</p>
