<b>Stuart Fergusson Victor Sutcliffe</b> (<a href="/wiki/23_June" id="w">23 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1940" id="w">1940</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/10_April" id="w">10 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a>) was an <a href="/wiki/Artist" id="w">artist</a>, and the original <a href="/wiki/Bass_guitar" id="w">bassist</a> of <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles" id="w">The Beatles</a> for two years. Sutcliffe earned praise for his <a href="/wiki/Paintings" id="w">paintings</a>, which mostly explored a style related to <a href="/wiki/Abstract_Expressionism" id="w">Abstract Expressionism</a>. </p>
<p>Sutcliffe and <a href="/wiki/John_Lennon" id="w">John Lennon</a> are credited with coming up with the name for The Beatles, as they both liked <a href="/wiki/Buddy_Holly" id="w">Buddy Holly</a>&#39;s band, <a href="/wiki/The_Crickets" id="w">the Crickets</a>. Sutcliffe played with The Beatles in <a href="/wiki/Hamburg" id="w">Hamburg</a>, where he met <a href="/wiki/Photographer" id="w">photographer</a> <a href="/wiki/Astrid_Kirchherr" id="w">Astrid Kirchherr</a>, to whom he was later engaged. He enrolled in the Hamburg College of Art after leaving The Beatles, and studied under future <a href="/wiki/Pop_art" id="w">pop artist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eduardo_Paolozzi" id="w">Eduardo Paolozzi</a>.</p>
<p>Sutcliffe suffered from debilitating headaches whilst he was studying in Hamburg, and although tests were carried out by German doctors, no reason could be found for his worsening condition. He died on the way to hospital in April 1962, with Kirchherr sitting alongside him in the ambulance. </p>

Sutcliffe&#39;s father, Charles Sutcliffe, was a <a href="/wiki/Navy" id="w">naval officer</a>, who was often at <a href="/wiki/Sea" id="w">sea</a> during his son&#39;s early years.  His mother, Millie, was a schoolteacher. Sutcliffe had a younger sister named Pauline.</p>
<p>A small but delicately handsome boy, Sutcliffe was born at the Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion Hospital in <a href="/wiki/1940" id="w">1940</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" id="w">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> and brought up at 37 Aigburth Drive in <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" id="w">Liverpool</a>, and attended the <a href="/wiki/Prescot_School" id="w">Prescot Grammar School</a>.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp105_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp105" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Sutcliffe sang in the local church choir in <a href="/wiki/Huyton" id="w">Huyton</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> When Sutcliffe&#39;s father did return home on leave, he invited his son and Rod Murray (Sutcliffe&#39;s room-mate) for a &#34;real good <a href="/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage" id="w">booze-up</a>&#34; and slipped £10 into Sutcliffe&#39;s pocket before disappearing for another six months.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp105_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp105" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ComprehensiveStuartSutcliffeBasic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ComprehensiveStuartSutcliffeBasic" title="">[4]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Sutcliffe met Lennon when they were both studying at the <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_College_of_Art" id="w">Liverpool College of Art</a>. According to Lennon, Sutcliffe had a &#34;marvellous art portfolio&#34; at the age of fourteen and was a seriously talented painter who was one of the &#34;stars&#34; of the school.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp105_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp105" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Spitzp107_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp107" title="">[5]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Paul_McCartney" id="w">Paul McCartney</a> said that he was jealous of Sutcliffe&#39;s relationship with Lennon, as he had to take a &#34;back seat&#34; to Sutcliffe (taking second-place to Sutcliffe in Lennon&#39;s friendship).<sup id="_ref-”TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD”_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-”TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD”" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>Sutcliffe lived in Percy Street before moving to Hillary Mansions at 3 Gambier Terrace, which was occupied by <a href="/wiki/Beatniks" id="w">Beatniks</a>.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp172_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp172" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The flat was near the new <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_Cathedral" id="w">Anglican Cathedral</a> in the run-down area of Liverpool 8, with bare lightbulbs and a mattress on the floor in the corner. Lennon moved in with Sutcliffe in early 1960.<sup id="_ref-Milesp50_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp50" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref- CynthiaJohnp63_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- CynthiaJohnp63" title="">[10]</a></sup> Sutcliffe painted the rooms yellow and black, which his landlady did not appreciate.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>After talking to Sutcliffe one night at The Cashbah Coffee Club, owned by <a href="/wiki/Pete_Best" id="w">Pete Best</a>&#39;s mother, <a href="/wiki/Mona_Best" id="w">Mona Best</a>, Lennon and McCartney persuaded Sutcliffe to buy a <a href="/wiki/H%C3%B6fner" id="w">Höfner</a> 500/5 model, known in <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> as a <i>President</i> bass with the money he had won in the John Moore art exhibition.<sup id="_ref-”TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD”_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-”TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD”" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Sutcliffe&#39;s fingers would often be blistered during long rehearsals, as he had never played long enough for his fingers to become <a href="/wiki/Callus" id="w">calloused</a>, although he had previously played acoustic guitar.<sup id="_ref- CynthiaJohnp64_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- CynthiaJohnp64" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Sutcliffe started acting as a <a href="/wiki/Booking_agent" id="w">booking agent</a> for the group, and they often used his flat as a rehearsal room.<sup id="_ref-Milesp50_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp50" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In July of 1960, the British Sunday newspaper <i><a href="/wiki/The_People" id="w">The People</a></i> ran an article entitled, &#34;The Beatnik Horror&#34;, which featured a photograph taken in the flat below Sutcliffe&#39;s, with a teenaged Lennon lying on the floor. <a href="/wiki/Allan_Williams" id="w">Allan Williams</a> had set up the photograph.  He took over from Sutcliffe booking concerts for &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Silver_Beetles" id="w">The Silver Beetles</a>&#34;, as they were then known, which was Lennon, McCartney and Sutcliffe.<sup id="_ref-Milesp53_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp53" title="">[16]</a></sup> The Beatles&#39; subsequent name-change came from an afternoon in the Renshaw Hall bar when Sutcliffe, Lennon, and <a href="/wiki/Cynthia_Lennon" id="w">Cynthia Powell</a> thought up names similar to Buddy Holly&#39;s band, <a href="/wiki/The_Crickets" id="w">The Crickets</a>, and came up with <i>The Beatals</i>.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp175_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp175" title="">[17]</a></sup> Lennon later changed the name to &#34;The Beatles&#34;, because he thought it sounded French  and suggested <i>Le Beat</i>, or <i>Beat-less</i>.<sup id="_ref- CynthiaJohnp65_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- CynthiaJohnp65" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<p>Sutcliffe&#39;s playing style was elementary, mostly sticking to <a href="/wiki/Root_note" id="w">root notes</a> of <a href="/wiki/Chord_(music)" id="w">chords</a>.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp184-185_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp184-185" title="">[20]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Bill_Harry" id="w">Bill Harry</a>, an art school friend of Sutcliffe&#39;s and the group, and founder and editor of the <i><a href="/wiki/Mersey_Beat" id="w">Mersey Beat</a></i> newspaper, complained to Sutcliffe that he should be concentrating on art and not music, as he thought that Sutcliffe was a competent but not brilliant <a href="/wiki/Bassist" id="w">bassist</a>.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp173-174_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp173-174" title="">[21]</a></sup> While Sutcliffe is often described in Beatles biographies as appearing very uncomfortable onstage, and as often playing with his back to the audience, Pete Best denies this, recalling Sutcliffe as usually good-natured and &#34;animated&#34; before an audience.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> When The Beatles auditioned for <a href="/wiki/Larry_Parnes" id="w">Larry Parnes</a> at the Wyvern Club, Seel Street, Liverpool, Williams stated that Parnes would have taken the group as the backing band for <a href="/wiki/Billy_Fury" id="w">Billy Fury</a>, but as Sutcliffe turned his back to Parnes throughout the audition—because, as Williams believed, Sutcliffe couldn&#39;t play very well—Parnes said that he would only employ the group if they got rid of Sutcliffe. Harry has said that the story is not true, as Parnes&#39; only concern was that the group had no permanent drummer.<sup id="_ref-HarryBeatleFolks_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HarryBeatleFolks" title="">[23]</a></sup> </p>
<p>McCartney has said that Sutcliffe was a typical art student, with bad skin and <a href="/wiki/Acne_vulgaris" id="w">pimples</a>, although in Hamburg, his stature grew after he began wearing dark <a href="/wiki/Ray-Ban_Wayfarer" id="w">Ray-Ban</a> sunglasses and tight trousers.<sup id="_ref-Milesp65_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp65" title="">[24]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/5_December" id="w">5 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1960" id="w">1960</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Harrison" id="w">George Harrison</a> was sent back to England for being under-age.

Lennon also started to critcise Sutcliffe, and made jokes about Sutcliffe&#39;s size and playing.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp242_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp242" title="">[28]</a></sup> </p>
<p>After Sutcliffe left The Beatles, he lent McCartney his President bass until the latter could earn enough money to buy a bass guitar of his own. Sutcliffe asked McCartney (who is left-handed) not to change the strings around, so McCartney had to play it upside down.<sup id="_ref-Milesp74-75_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp74-75" title="">[29]</a></sup> In 1967, The Beatles included a photo of Sutcliffe among those on the cover of the <i><a href="/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%26%2339%3Bs_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band" id="w">Sgt.

Kirchherr was raised by her <a href="/wiki/Widowed" id="w">widowed</a> mother, Nielsa Kirchherr, in Eimsbütteler Strasse in the wealthy Hamburg <a href="/wiki/Suburb" id="w">suburb</a> of <a href="/wiki/Altona" id="w">Altona</a>.<sup id="_ref-Milesp64_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp64" title="">[30]</a></sup> Sutcliffe met Kirchherr in the Kaiserkeller club, where she went to watch The Beatles perform. After a photo session with them, Kirchherr invited the group to her mother&#39;s house for tea and showed them her bedroom, decorated in all black —- including the furniture -— with silver foil on the walls, and a large tree branch hanging from the ceiling. Sutcliffe began dating Kirchherr shortly thereafter.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp224_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp224" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sutcliffe wrote to friends that he was infatuated with Kirchherr, and asked her friends which colours, films, books, and painters she liked. Pete Best commented that the beginning of their relationship was, &#34;like one of those fairy stories&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp225_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp225" title="">[32]</a></sup> Kirchherr and Sutcliffe got engaged in November, 1960, and exchanged rings, as is the German custom.<sup id="_ref-Milesp65_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp65" title="">[24]</a></sup> Sutcliffe wrote to his parents that he was engaged to Kirchherr, something they were shocked to learn, as they assumed he would give up his career as an artist.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp235_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp235" title="">[33]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Kirchherr and Sutcliffe traveled to Liverpool in the summer of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe&#39;s family and to see his home city before their marriage.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp278_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp278" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h1>Death</h1>
<p>Stuart Sutcliffe collapsed in the middle of an art class in Hamburg. Nielsa Kirchherr had German doctors perform various tests, but they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the intense headaches from which he had been suffering. Whilst living at the Kirchherrs&#39; house in Hamburg, his condition grew steadily worse. After collapsing again, Sutcliffe was taken to a hospital by Kirchherr (who rode with him in the ambulance), but he died before  reaching the hospital. The cause of death was Cerebral Paralysis, after bleeding in the right ventricle of his brain.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp305_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp305" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CynthiaJohnp110_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CynthiaJohnp110" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/13_April" id="w">13 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a>, Kirchherr met The Beatles at the Hamburg airport and told them that Sutcliffe had died from a <a href="/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage" id="w">brain hemorrhage</a> a few days before.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp305_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp305" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-BeatlesTimeline_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BeatlesTimeline" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>It has never been known precisely what caused the brain hemorrhage that took Sutcliffe&#39;s life. Some believe that the cause was an earlier <a href="/wiki/Head_injury" id="w">head injury</a>, sustained during a fight outside <a href="/wiki/Lathom" id="w">Lathom Hall</a> after a live performance in January of 1961 (although Sutcliffe had been beaten up before).<sup id="_ref-Spitzp240_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp240" title="">[37]</a></sup> According to former manager <a href="/wiki/Allan_Williams" id="w">Allan Williams</a>, Lennon and Best went to Sutcliffe&#39;s aid, fighting off his attackers before dragging him to safety. Sutcliffe sustained a fractured skull in the fight, and Lennon broke his pinky finger.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp241_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp241" title="">[38]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Sutcliffe had refused medical attention at the time (and had not kept an X-ray appointment at the Sefton General Hospital).  He saw a doctor only months later in Germany, when he began experiencing severe headaches and acute sensitivity to light.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Kirchherr said later that some of the headaches left Sutcliffe temporarily blind.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp278_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp278" title="">[34]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CynthiaJohnp110_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CynthiaJohnp110" title="">[36]</a></sup> </p>
<p>After Sutcliffe&#39;s death, Kirchherr wrote a letter to Millie Sutcliffe, apologising for being too ill to attend his funeral in Liverpool and saying how much she and Lennon missed him: {{cquote}}</p>

<p>One of Sutcliffe&#39;s paintings was shown at the <a href="/wiki/Walker_Art_Gallery" id="w">Walker Art Gallery</a> in Liverpool as part of the <a href="/wiki/John_Moores_(merchant)" id="w">John Moores</a> exhibition from November 1959 until January 1960. After the exhibition, John Moores bought Sutcliffe&#39;s canvas for £75, which was then equal to 6-7 weeks&#39; wages for an average working man.<sup id="_ref-Milesp50_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp50" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>After meeting Kirchherr, Sutcliffe decided to leave The Beatles and enrolled at the Hamburg College of Art in June 1961, under the tutelage of Paolozzi who respected Sutcliffe&#39;s talent, and later wrote a report stating that although Sutcliffe had missed some lessons because of illness, he was considered by Paolozzi to be one of his &#34;best students&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Milesp65_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp65" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Sutcliffe&#39;s few surviving works reveal influence from the British and <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">European</a> abstract artists contemporary with the Abstract Expressionist movement in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. His earlier figurative work is reminiscent of the <a href="/wiki/Kitchen_sink_realism" id="w">kitchen sink school</a>, particularly of <a href="/wiki/John_Bratby" id="w">John Bratby</a>, though Sutcliffe was producing abstract work by the end of the 1950s, including <i>The Summer Painting</i>, purchased by Moores. Rod Murray remembered that the painting was painted on a board, not a canvas, and had to be cut into two pieces (because of its size) and hinged. Murray added that only one of the pieces actually got to the exhibition but sold nonetheless.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp168_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp168" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sutcliffe&#39;s works bear some comparison with those of John Hoyland and <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_de_Sta%C3%ABl" id="w">Nicolas de Staël</a>, though they are more lyrical. His later works are typically untitled, constructed from heavily impastoed slabs of pigment in the manner of de Staël, and overlaid with scratched or squeezed linear elements creating enclosed spaces. <i>Hamburg Painting no. 2</i> was purchased by Liverpool&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Walker_Art_Gallery" id="w">Walker Art Gallery</a> and is one of a series entitled &#34;<i>Hamburg</i>&#34; in which the surface and color changes produced atmospheric energy. European artists (including Paolozzi) were influencing Sutcliffe at the time.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> The Walker Art Gallery has other works by Sutcliffe, which are &#34;<i>Self-portrait</i>&#34; (in charcoal) and &#34;<i>The Crucifixion</i>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lennon later hung a pair of Sutcliffe&#39;s paintings in his house (<a href="/wiki/Kenwood%2C_St._George%26%2339%3Bs_Hill" id="w">Kenwood</a>) in Weybridge.

<p>The Beatles&#39; compilation album <i><a href="/wiki/Anthology_1" id="w">Anthology 1</a></i>, consisting mostly of previously unreleased recordings from the band&#39;s early years, was released in 1995. Sutcliffe is pictured on the front cover, as he was on <i>Sgt. Pepper  28 years before.  More importantly, he is featured playing bass with the Beatles on three songs that the band recorded in 1960: &#34;Hallelujah, I Love Her So&#34;, &#34;<a href="/wiki/You%26%2339%3Bll_Be_Mine" id="w">You&#39;ll Be Mine</a>&#34;, and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Cayenne_(song)" id="w">Cayenne</a>&#34;.</i></p>
