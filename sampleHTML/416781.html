<p><b>Gregory Lloyd Campbell</b> (born <a href="/wiki/February_15" id="w">February 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a>) is a <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland" id="w">Northern Ireland</a> <a href="/wiki/Unionists_(Ireland)" id="w">unionist</a> politician, and the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party" id="w">Democratic Unionist Party</a> <a href="/wiki/Member_of_Parliament" id="w">member</a> of the <a href="/wiki/British_parliament" id="w">British parliament</a> for <a href="/wiki/East_Londonderry_(constituency)" id="w">East Londonderry</a>.</p>
<p>Campbell was raised in <a href="/wiki/Derry" id="w">Derry</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Waterside%2C_Derry" id="w">Waterside</a> area and was educated at Londonderry Technical College and the <a href="/wiki/Magee_College" id="w">University of Ulster (Magee College site)</a>. He joined the DUP in the <a href="/wiki/1970s" id="w">1970s</a> and was first elected to <a href="/wiki/Derry_City_Council" id="w">Londonderry County Borough Council</a> in <a href="/wiki/1981" id="w">1981</a>. Campbell briefly stepped down in <a href="/wiki/1984" id="w">1984</a> when the council changed its name to Derry City Council, although before he returned to his seat not long after and still holds it.</p>
<p>He was chosen to contest the <a href="/wiki/Foyle_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" id="w">Foyle constituency</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1983" id="w">general election of 1983</a>. He contested the same seat again in the general elections of <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1987" id="w">1987</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1992" id="w">1992</a>, although each time he finished second behind <a href="/wiki/Social_Democratic_and_Labour_Party" id="w">Social Democratic and Labour Party</a> leader <a href="/wiki/John_Hume" id="w">John Hume</a>.</p>
<p>Given that Foyle had a predominantly <a href="/wiki/Irish_nationalism" id="w">nationalist</a> population, the increasingly high profile Campbell was transferred to the more winnable East Londonderry seat, where he ran unsuccessfully in <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1997" id="w">1997</a>. Campbell won the seat at his second attempt in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2001" id="w">2001 general election</a>, gaining a majority of 1,901 over sitting MP <a href="/wiki/William_Ross_(Northern_Ireland_politician)" id="w">William Ross</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Ulster_Unionist_Party" id="w">Ulster Unionist Party</a>. He was re-elected in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2005" id="w">2005 general election</a>, this time securing an increased majority of 7,498 over the new UUP candidate <a href="/wiki/David_McClarty" id="w">David McClarty</a>. He is also a member of the  <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly" id="w">Northern Ireland Assembly</a>, topping the Londonderry East poll (from which 6 members are elected) in the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_Election%2C_1998" id="w">1998 election</a>, <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_Election%2C_2003" id="w">2003</a> and again in <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_Election%2C_2007" id="w">March 2007</a>. He was appointed Minister of Regional Development in the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Executive" id="w">Northern Ireland Executive</a> in July <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a>.</p>
