<b>Red-figure vase painting</b> is one of the most important styles of figural <a href="/wiki/Pottery_of_ancient_Greece" id="w">Greek vase painting</a>. It developed in <a href="/wiki/Athens" id="w">Athens</a> around 530 BC and remained in use until the late 3rd century BC. It replaced the previously dominant style of <a href="/wiki/Black-figure_vase_painting" id="w">Black-figure vase painting</a> within a few decades. Its modern name is based on the figural depictions in red colour on a black background, in contrast to the preceding black-figure style with black figures on a red background. The most important areas of production, apart from <a href="/wiki/Attica" id="w">Attica</a>, were in <a href="/wiki/Magna_Graecia" id="w">Southern Italy</a>. The style was also adopted in other parts of <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greece</a>. <a href="/wiki/Etruria" id="w">Etruria</a> became an important centre of production outside the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" id="w">Greek World</a>.</p>
<p>Attic red-figure  vases were exported throughout Greece and beyond. For a long time, they dominated the market for fine ceramics. Only few centres of pottery production could compete with Athens in terms of innovativeness, quality and production capacity. Of the red figure vases produced in Athens alone, more than 40,000 specimens and fragments survive today. From the second most important production centre, Southern Italy, more than 20,000 vases and fragments are preserved. Starting with the studies by <a href="/wiki/John_Beazley" id="w">John D. Beazley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Dale_Trendall" id="w">Arthur Dale Trendall</a>, the study of this style of art has made enormous progress. Some vases can be ascribed to individual artists or schools.

Red figure is, put simply, the reverse of the black figure technique. The paintings were applied to the shaped but unfired vessels after they had dried to a leathery, near-brittle texture. In <a href="/wiki/Attica" id="w">Attica</a>, the normal unburnt clay was of orange colour at this stage. The outlines of the intended figures were drawn either with a blunt scraper, leaving a slight groove, or with charcoal, which would disappear entirely during firing. Then, the contours were redrawn with a brush, using a glossy clay <a href="/wiki/Slip_(ceramics)" id="w">slip</a>. Occasionally, the painter decided to somewhat change the figural scene. In such cases, the grooves from the original sketch sometimes remain visible. Important contours were often drawn with a thicker slip, leading to a slightly protruding outline (relief line); less important lines and internal details were drawn with diluted glossy clay. Detail in other colours, like white or red, were applied at this point. The relief line was probably drawn with a bristle brush or a hair, dipped in thick paint. The suggestion of a hollow needle seems somewhat unlikely<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>. The application of relief outlines was necessary, as the rather liquid glossy clay would otherwise have turned out too dull. After the technique&#39;s initial phase of development, both alternatives were used, so as to differentiate gradations and details more clearly. The space between figures was filled with a glossy grey clay slip. Then, the vases underwent triple-phase firing, during which the glossy clay reached its characteristic black or black-brown colour through <a href="/wiki/Reduction" id="w">reduction</a>, the reddish color by a final re-<a href="/wiki/Oxidation" id="w">oxidation</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Since this final oxidizing phase was fired using lower temperatures, the glazed parts of the vase did not re-oxidized from black to red: their finer surface was melted (sintered) in the reducing phase, and now protected from oxygen.</p>

The new technique had the primary advantage of permitting a far better execution of internal detail. In black-figure vase painting, such details had to be scratched into the painted surfaces, which was always less accurate than the direct application of detail with a brush. Red-figure depictions were generally more lively and realistic than the black-figure <a href="/wiki/Silhouette" id="w">silhouettes</a>. They were also more clearly contrasted against the black backgrounds. It was now possible to depict humans not only in profile, but also in frontal, rear, or three-quarter perspectives. The red-figure technique also permitted the indication of a third dimension on the figures. However, it also had disadvantages. For example, the distinction of sex by using black slip for male skin and white paint for female skin was now impossible. The ongoing trend to depict heroes and deities naked and of youthful age also made it harder to distinguish the sexes through garments or hairstyles. In the initial phases, there were also miscalculations regarding the thickness of human figures. In black-figure vase painting, the pre-drawn outlines were a part of the figure. In red-figure vases, the outline would, after firing, form part of the black background. This led to vases with very thin figures early on. A further problem was that the black background did not permit the depiction of space with any depth, so that the use of spatial perspective almost never was attempted. Nonetheless, the advantages outnumbered the disadvantages. The depiction of muscles and other anatomical detail clearly illustrates the development of the style.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

Black figure vase painting had been developed in <a href="/wiki/Corinth" id="w">Corinth</a> in the 7th century BC and quickly became the dominant style of pottery decoration throughout the Greek world and beyond. Although Corinth dominated the overall market, regional markets and centres of production did develop. Initially, Athens copied the Corinthian style, but it gradually came to rival and overcome the dominance of Corinth. Attic artists developed the style to an unprecedented quality, reaching the apex of their creative possibilities in the second third of the 6th century BC. <a href="/wiki/Exekias" id="w">Exekias</a>, active around 530 BC, can be seen as the most important representative of the black-figure style. </p>

<a id="Beginnings" name="Beginnings"></a><h2> Beginnings </h2>
<p>The first red-figure vases were produced around 530 BC. The invention of the technique normally is accredited to the <a href="/wiki/Andokides_Painter" id="w">Andokides Painter</a>. He, and other early representatives of the style, eg. <a href="/wiki/Psiax" id="w">Psiax</a>, initially painted vases in both styles, with black-figure scenes on one side, and red-figure on the other. Such vases, eg. the <a href="/wiki/Belly_Amphora_by_the_Andokides_Painter_(Munich_2301)" id="w">Belly Amphora by the Andokides Painter (Munich 2301)</a>, are called <a href="/wiki/Bilingual_pottery" id="w">bilingual vases</a>. Although they display major advances against the black figure style, the figures still appear somewhat stilted and seldom overlap. Compositions and techniques of the older style remained in use. Thus, incised lines are quite common, as is the additional application of red paint (&#34;added red&#34;) to cover large areas.<sup id="_ref-Oakley1141_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oakley1141" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

The artists of the so called &#34;<a href="/wiki/Pioneer_Group" id="w">Pioneer Group</a>&#34; made the step towards a full exploitation of the possibilities of the red-figure technique.

As a technical innovation, Euphronios introduced the &#34;relief line&#34;.

New shapes include the <i><a href="/wiki/Psykter" id="w">psykter</a></i> and the <i><a href="/wiki/Pelike" id="w">pelike</a></i>. Large <i><a href="/wiki/Krater" id="w">krater</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Amphorae" id="w">amphorae</a></i> became popular at this time. Although there is no indication that the painters understood themselves as a group in the way that modern scholarship does, there were some connections and mutual influences, perhaps, in an atmosphere of friendly competition and encouragement. Thus, a vase by Euthymides is inscribed <i>&#34;as Euphronios never [would have been able]&#34;</i>. More generally, the pioneer group tended to use inscriptions. The labelling of mythological figures or the addition of <a href="/wiki/Kalos_inscription" id="w">Kalos inscriptions</a> are the rule rather than the exception.<sup id="_ref-Oakley1141_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oakley1141" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

The generation of artists after the pioneers, active during the Late <a href="/wiki/Archaic_period_in_Greece" id="w">Archaic</a> period (<i>circa</i> 500 to 470 BC) brought the style to a new flourish. During this time, black-figure vases failed to reach the same quality and were pushed out of the market eventually. Some of the most famous Attic vase painters belong to this generation. They include the <a href="/wiki/Berlin_Painter" id="w">Berlin Painter</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Kleophrades_Painter" id="w">Kleophrades Painter</a>, and among the bowl painters <a href="/wiki/Onesimos_(vase_painter)" id="w">Onesimos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Douris_(vase_painter)" id="w">Douris</a>, <a href="/wiki/Makron_(vase_painter)" id="w">Makron</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Brygos_Painter" id="w">Brygos Painter</a>. The improvement of quality went along with a doubling of output during this period. Athens became the dominant producer of fine pottery in the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean" id="w">Mediterranean</a> world, overshadowing nearly all other production centres.<sup id="_ref-Oakley1142_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oakley1142" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the key features of this most successful Attic vase painting style is the mastery of perspective foreshortening, allowing a much more naturalistic depiction of figures and actions. Another characteristic is the drastic reduction of figures per vessel, of anatomic details, and of ornamental decorations. In contrast, the repertoire of depicted scenes was increased. For example, the myths surrounding <a href="/wiki/Theseus" id="w">Theseus</a> became very popular at this time. New or modified vase shapes were frequently employed, including the Nolan amphora (see <a href="/wiki/Typology_of_Greek_Vase_Shapes" id="w">Typology of Greek Vase Shapes</a>), <a href="/wiki/Lekythos" id="w">lekythoi</a>, as well as bowls of the <i><a href="/wiki/Askos_(pottery_vessel)" id="w">askos</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Dinos" id="w">dinos</a></i> types.

As a result, the depictions gained seriousness, even <i><a href="/wiki/Pathos" id="w">pathos</a></i>. The folds of garments were depicted less linear, thus appearing more plastic. The manner of presenting scenes also changed substantially. Firstly, the paintings ceased to focus on the moment of a particular event, but rather, with dramatic tension, showed the situation immediately before the action, thus implying and contextualsing the event proper. Also, some of the other new achievements of <a href="/wiki/Athenian_democracy" id="w">Athenian democracy</a> began to show an influence on vase painting. Thus, influences of <a href="/wiki/Tragedy#Origin" id="w">tragedy</a> and of <a href="/wiki/Art_in_ancient_Greece%23Painting#Wall painting" id="w">wall painting</a> can be detected. Since Greek wall painting is almost entirely lost today, its reflection on vases constitutes one of the few, albeit modest, sources of information on that genre of art. Other influences on High Classical vase painting include the newly erected <a href="/wiki/Parthenon" id="w">Parthenon</a> and its <a href="/wiki/Parthenon#Sculptural decoration" id="w">sculptural decoration</a>. This is especially visible in the depiction of garments, The material now falls more naturally, more folds are depicted, leading to an increased &#34;depth&#34; of the depiction. The overall compositions were simplified even more. Artists placed special emphasis on <a href="/wiki/Symmetry" id="w">symmetry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Harmony" id="w">harmony</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Balance" id="w">balance</a>. The human figures had returned to their earlier slenderness; often they radiate a self-absorbed, divine serenity.

During the Late Classical period, in the final quarter of the 5th century, two opposed trends were created. On the one hand, a style of vase painting strongly influenced by the &#34;Rich Style&#34; of sculpture developed, on the other, some workshops continued the developments of the High Classical period,with an increased emphasis on the depiction of emotion, and a range of erotic scenes. The most important representative of the Rich Style is the <a href="/wiki/Meidias_Painter" id="w">Meidias Painter</a>. Characteristic features include transparent garments and multiple folds of cloth. There is also an increase in the depiction of jewellery and other objects. The use of additional colours, mostly white and gold, depicting accessories in a low relief, is very striking. Over time, there is a marked &#34;softening&#34;: The male body, heretofore defined by the depiction of muscles, gradually lost that key feature.<sup id="_ref-Oakley1142_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oakley1142" title="">[5]</a></sup>

The paintings depicted mythological scenes less frequently than before. Images of the private and domestic world became more and more important. Scenes from the life of women are especially frequent. Mythological scenes are dominated by images of <a href="/wiki/Dionysos" id="w">Dionysos</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aphrodite" id="w">Aphrodite</a>. It is not clear what caused this change of depicted topic among some of the artists. Suggestions include a context with the horrors of the <a href="/wiki/Peloponnesian_War" id="w">Peloponnesian War</a>, but also the loss of Athens&#39; dominant role in the mediterranean pottery trade (itself partially a result of the war). The increasing role of new markets, eg. <a href="/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula" id="w">Iberia</a>, implied new needs and wishes on part of the customers. These theories are contradicted by the fact that some artists maintained the earlier style. Some, eg. the <a href="/wiki/Eretria_Painter" id="w">Eretria Painter</a>, attempted to combine both traditions. The best works of the Late Classical period are often found on smaller vessels, such as belly <i><a href="/wiki/Lekythos" id="w">lekythoi</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Pyxis_(pottery)" id="w">pyxides</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Oinochoe" id="w">oinochai</a></i>. <i>Lekanis</i>, Bell krater(see<a href="/wiki/Typology_of_Greek_Vase_Shapes" id="w">Typology of Greek Vase Shapes</a>) and <i><a href="/wiki/Hydria" id="w">hydria</a></i> were also popular.<sup id="_ref-Oakley1143_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oakley1143" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

The final decades of Attic red--figure vase painting are dominated by the <a href="/wiki/Kerch_Style" id="w">Kerch Style</a>. This style, current between 370 and 330 BC, combined the preceding Rich and Modest Styles, with a preponderance of the Rich. Crowded compositions with large statuesque figures are typical. The added colours now include blue, green and others. Volume and shading are indicated by the use of diluted runny glossy clay. Occasionally, whole figures are added as appliques, i.e. as thin figural reliefs attached to the body of the vase. The variety of vessel shapes in use was reduced sharply. Common painted shapes include <i>pelike</i>, chalice <i>krater</i>, belly <i>lekythos</i>, <i>skyphos</i>, <i>hydria</i> and <i>oinochoe</i>. Scenes from female life are very common. Mythological themes are still dominated by <a href="/wiki/Dionysos" id="w">Dionysos</a>; <a href="/wiki/Ariadne" id="w">Ariadne</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heracles" id="w">Heracles</a> are the most commonly depicted heroes.

The <a href="/wiki/Kerameikos" id="w">Kerameikos</a> was the potters&#39; quarter of Athens. It contained a variety of small workshops, and probably a few larger ones. In 1852, during building activity in <a href="/wiki/Ermou_Street" id="w">Ermou Street</a>, the workshop of the <a href="/wiki/Jena_Painter" id="w">Jena Painter</a> was discovered. The artefacts from it are now on display in the University collection of the <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Schiller_University_of_Jena" id="w">Friedrich Schiller University of Jena</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>.  According to modern research, the workshops were owned by the potters. The names of about 40 Attic vase painters are known, from vase inscriptions, usually accompanied by the words {{Polytonic}} (égrapsen, has painted). In contrast, the signature of the potter, {{Polytonic}} (epoíesen, has made) has survived on more than twice as many, namely circa 100, pots (both numbers refer to the totality of Attic figural vase painting). Although signatures had been known since circa 580 BC (first known signature by the potter <a href="/wiki/Sophilos" id="w">Sophilos</a>), their use increased to an apex around the Pioneering Phase. A changing, apparently increasingly negative, attitude to artisans led to a reduction of signatures, starting during the Classical period at the latest<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>. Overall, signatures are quite rare. The fact that they are mostly found on especially good pieces indicates that they epressed the pride of potter and/or painter.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

The status of painters in relation to that of potters remains somewhat unclear. The fact that eg. <a href="/wiki/Euphronius" id="w">Euphronius</a> was able to work as both painter and potter suggests that at least some of the painters were not <a href="/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Greece" id="w">slaves</a>. On the other hand, some of the known names indicate that there were at least some former slaves and some <i><a href="/wiki/Perioikoi" id="w">perioikoi</a></i> among the painters. Additionally, some of the names are not unique: for example, several painters signed as <a href="/wiki/Polygnotos" id="w">Polygnotos</a>. This may represent attempts to profit from the name of that great painter. The same may be the case where painters bear otherwise fanous names, like <a href="/wiki/Aristophanes_(vase_painter)" id="w">Aristophanes (vase painter)</a>. The careers of some vase painters are quite well known. Apart from painters with relatively short periods of activity (one or two decades), some can be traced for much longer. Examples include <a href="/wiki/Douris_(vase_painter)" id="w">Douris</a>, <a href="/wiki/Makron_(vase_painter)" id="w">Makron</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hermonax" id="w">Hermonax</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Achilles_Painter" id="w">Achilles Painter</a>. The fact that several painters later became potters, and the relatively frequent cases were it is unclear whether some potters were also painters or <i>vice versa</i>, suggest a career structure, perhaps starting with an apprenticeship involving mainly painting, and leading up to being a potter. This division of labours appears to have developed along with the introduction of red-figure painting, since many potter-painters are known from the black-figure period (including <a href="/wiki/Exekias" id="w">Exekias</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nearchos" id="w">Nearchos</a> and perhaps the <a href="/wiki/Amasis_Painter" id="w">Amasis Painter</a>). The increased demand for exports would have led to new structures of production, encouraging specialisation and division of labours, leading on to a sometimes ambiguous distinction between painter and potter. As mentioned above, the painting of vessels was probably mainly the responsibility of younger assistants or apprentices. Some further conclusions regarding the organisational aspects of pottery production can be suggested. It appears that generally, several painters worked for one pottery workshop, as indicated by the fact that frequently, several roughly contemporary pots by the same potter are painted by various painters. For examples, pots made by <a href="/wiki/Euphronios" id="w">Euphronios</a> have been found to be painted by <a href="/wiki/Onesimos_(vase_painter)" id="w">Onesimos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Douris_(vase_painter)" id="w">Douris</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Antiphon_Painter" id="w">Antiphon Painter</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Triptolemos_Painter" id="w">Triptolemos Painter</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Pistoxenos_Painter" id="w">Pistoxenos Painter</a>. In contrast, an individual painter could also change from workshop to another.

Although from a modern perspective the vase painters are often considered as artists, and their vases thus as works of <a href="/wiki/Art" id="w">art</a>, this view is not consistent with that held in antiquity. Vase painters, like potters, were considered as craftsmen, their produce as trade goods.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The craftsmen must have had a reasonably high level of education, as a variety of inscriptions occur. On the one hand, the aforementioned <a href="/wiki/Kalos_inscription" id="w">Kalos inscriptions</a> are common, on the other hand, inscriptions often label the depicted figures. That not every vase painter could write is shown by some examples of meaningless rows of random letters. The vases indicate a steady improvement of literacy from the 6th century BC onwards.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Whether potters, and perhaps vase painters, belonged to the Attic <a href="/wiki/Elite" id="w">elite</a> has not been satisfactorily clarified so far. Do the frequent depictions of the <a href="/wiki/Symposium" id="w">symposium</a>, a definite upper-class activity, reflect the painters personal experience, their aspirations to attend such events, or simply the demands of the market?<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> A large proportion of the painted vases produced, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Psykter" id="w">psykter</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Krater" id="w">krater</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Kalpis" id="w">kalpis</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Stamnos" id="w">stamnos</a></i>, as well as <i><a href="/wiki/Kylix_(drinking_cup)" id="w">kylikes</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Kantharos" id="w">kantharoi</a></i>, were made and bought to be used at symposia.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Elaborately painted vases were good, but not the best, table wares available to a Greek. Metal vessels, especially from precious metals, were held in higher regard. Nonetheless, painted vases were not cheap products; especially the larger specimens were expensive. Around 500 BC, a large painted vase cost about one <a href="/wiki/Drachma#Ancient drachma" id="w">drachma</a>, equivalent to the daily wage of a stonemason. It has been suggested that the painted vases represent an attempt to imitate metal vessels. It is normally assumed that the lower social classes tended to use simple undecorated coarse wares, massive quantities of which are found in <a href="/wiki/Excavation" id="w">excavations</a>. Tablewares made of perishable materials, like wood, may have been even more widespread.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Nonetheless, multiple finds of red-figure vases, usually not of the highest quality, found in settlements, prove that such vessels were used in daily life. A large proportion of production was taken up by cult and grave vessels. In any case, it can be assumed that the production of high-quality pottery was a profitable business. For example, an expensive <a href="/wiki/Votive" id="w">votive</a> gift by the painter Euphronios was found on the <a href="/wiki/Athenian_Acropolis" id="w">Athenian Acropolis</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  There can be little doubt that the export of such pottery made an important sontribution to the affluence of Athens. It is hardly surprising that many workshops appear to have aimed their production at export markets, for example by producing vessel shapes that were more popular in the target region than in Athens. The 4th century BC demise of Attic vase painting tellingly coincides with the very period when the <a href="/wiki/Etruscans" id="w">Etruscans</a>, probably the main western export market, came under increasing pressure from <a href="/wiki/Magna_Graecia" id="w">South Italian Greeks</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">Romans</a>. A further reason for the end of the production of figurally decorated vases is a change in tastes at the start of the <a href="/wiki/Hellenistic_civilization" id="w">Hellenistic period</a>. The main reason, however, should be seen in the increasingly unsuccessful progress of the Peloponnesian War, culminating in the devastating defeat of Athens in 404 BC. After this, <a href="/wiki/Sparta" id="w">Sparta</a> controlled the western trade, albeit without having the economic strength to fully exploit it. The Attic potters had to find new markets; they did so in the <a href="/wiki/Black_Sea" id="w">Black Sea</a> area. But Athens and its industries never fully recovered from the defeat. Some potters and painters had already relocated to Italy during the war, seeking better economic conditions. A key indicator for the export-oriented nature of Attic vase production is the nearly total absence of theatre scenes. Buyers from other cultural backgrounds, such as Etruscans or later customers in the <a href="/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula" id="w">Iberian Peninsula</a>, would have found such depiction incomprehensible or uninteresting. In Southern Italian vase painting, which was mostly not aimed at export, such scenes are quite common.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Southern_Italy" name="Southern_Italy"></a><h1> Southern Italy </h1>
<p>At least from a modern point of view, the Southern Italian red-figure vase paintings represent the only region of production that reaches Attic standards of artistic quality. After the Attic vases, the <a href="/wiki/South_Italian" id="w">South Italian</a> ones (including those from <a href="/wiki/Sicily" id="w">Sicily</a>), are the most thoroughly researched. In contrastic to their Attic counterparts, they were mostly produced for local markets. Only few pieces have been found outside Southern Italy and Sicily. The first workshops were founded in the mid-5th century BC by Attic potters. Soon, local craftsmen were trained and the thematic and formal dependance on Attic vases overcome. Towards the end of the century, the distinctive &#34;ornate style&#34; and &#34;plain style&#34; developed in <a href="/wiki/Apulia" id="w">Apulia</a>. Especially the ornate style was adopted by other mainland schools, but without reaching the same quality.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>By now, 21,000 South Italian vases and fragments are known. Of those, 11,000 are ascribed to Apulian workshops, 4,000 to Campanian, 2,000 to Paestan, 1,500 to Lucanian and 1,000 to Sicilian ones.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

The <a href="/wiki/Apulia" id="w">Apulian</a> vase painting tradition is considered as the leading South Italian style. The main centre of production was at <a href="/wiki/Taras" id="w">Taras</a>. Apulian red-figure vases were produced from <i>circa</i> 430 to 300 BC. The plain and ornate styles are distinguished. The main difference between them is that the plain style favoured bell <i>craters</i>, colonet <i>kraters</i> and smaller vessels, and that a single &#34;plain&#34; vessel rarely depicted more than four figures. The main subjects were mythological scenes, female heads, warriors in scenes of combat of farewell, and dionysiac <a href="/wiki/Dionysian_mysteries" id="w">thiasos</a> imagery. The reverse often showed youths wearing cloaks. The key feature of these simply decorated wares is the general absence of additional colours. Important plain style representatives are the <a href="/wiki/Sisyphus_Painter" id="w">Sisyphus Painter</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Tarporley_Painter" id="w">Tarporley Painter</a>. After the mid-4th century BC, the style grows more and more similar to the ornate style. An important artist of that period is the <a href="/wiki/Varrese_Painter" id="w">Varrese Painter</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup>

The artists using the ornate style tended to favour large vessels, like volute <i>kraters</i>, <i>amphorae</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Loutrophoros" id="w">loutrophoroi</a></i> and <i>hydriai</i>. The larger surface area was used to depict up to 20 figures, often in several registers on the body of the vase. Additional colours, especially shades of red, yellow-gold and white are used copiously. Since the 2nd half of the 4th century, the necks and sides of the vases are decorated with rich vegetal or ornamental decorations. At the same time, perspective views, especially of buildings such as &#34;Palace of <a href="/wiki/Hades" id="w">Hades</a>&#34; (<i><a href="/wiki/Naiskos" id="w">naiskoi</a></i>), develop. Since 360 BC, such structures are often depicted in scenes connected with burial rites (<i>naiskos</i> vases). Important representatives of this style are the <a href="/wiki/Ilioupersis_Painter" id="w">Ilioupersis Painter</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Darius_Painter" id="w">Darius Painter</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Baltimore_Painter" id="w">Baltimore Painter</a>. Mythological scenes were especially popular: The assembly of the Gods, the <a href="/wiki/Amazonomachy" id="w">amazonomachy</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Trojan_War" id="w">Trojan War</a>, <a href="/wiki/Heracles" id="w">Heracles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bellerophon" id="w">Bellerophon</a>. Additionally, such vases frequently depict scenes from myths that are only rarely illustrated on vases. Some specimens represent the single source for the iconography of a particular myth. Another subject that is unknown from Attic vase painting are the theatre scenes. Especially farce scenes, eg from the so-called <i><a href="/wiki/Phlyax_play" id="w">phlyax</a></i> vases are quite common. Scenes of athletic activity or everyday life only occur in the early phase, they disappear entirely after 370 BC.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Apulian vase painting had a formative influence on the traditions of the other South Italian production centres. It is assumed that individual Apulian artists settled in other Italian cities and contributed their skills there. Apart from red-figure, Apulia also produced black-varnished vases with painted decor (Gnathia vases) and polychrome vases (Canosa vases).<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/Campania" id="w">Campania</a> also produced red-figure vases in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. The light brown clay of Campania was covered with a slip that developed a pink or red tint after firing. The Campanian painters preferred smaller vessel types, but also <i>hydriai</i> and bell <i>kraters</i>. The most popular shape is the bow-handled amphora. Many typical Apulian vessel shapes, like volute <i>kraters</i>, colonette <i>kraters</i>, <i>loutrophoroi</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Rhyton" id="w">rhyta</a></i> and <i>nestoris</i> amphorae are absent, <i><a href="/wiki/Pelike" id="w">pelikes</a></i> are rare. The repertoire of motifs is limited. Subjects include youths, women, thiasos scenes, birds and animals, and often native warriors. The backs often show cloaked youths. Mythological scenes and depictions related to burial rites play a subsidiary role. <i>Naiskos scsnes</i>, ornamental elements and polychromy are adopted after 340 BC under Lucanian influence.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Before the immigration of Sicilian potters in the second quarter of the 4th century BC, when several workshops were established in Campania, only the <a href="/wiki/Owl-Pillar_Group" id="w">Owl-Pillar Workshop</a> of the second half of the 5th century is known. Campanian vase painting is subdivided in three main groups:</p>
<p>The first group is represented by the <a href="/wiki/Kassandra_Painter" id="w">Kassandra Painter</a> from <a href="/wiki/Capua" id="w">Capua</a>, still under Sicilian influence. He was followed by the workshop of the <a href="/wiki/Parrish_Painter" id="w">Parrish Painter</a> and that of the <a href="/wiki/Laghetto_Painter" id="w">Laghetto Painter</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Caivano_Painter" id="w">Caivano Painter</a>. Their work is characterised by a preference for <a href="/wiki/Satyr" id="w">satyr</a> figures with <a href="/wiki/Thyrsos" id="w">thyrsos</a>, depictions of heads (normally below the handles of <i>hydriai</i>), decorative borders of garments, and the frequent use of additional white, red and yellow. The Laghetto and Caivano Painters appear to have moved to <a href="/wiki/Paestum" id="w">Paestum</a> later.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/AV_Group" id="w">AV Group</a> also had its workshop in Capua. Of particular importance is the <a href="/wiki/Whiteface-Frignano_Painter" id="w">Whiteface-Frignano Painter</a>, one of the first in this group. His typical characteristic is the use of additional white paint to depict the faces of women. This group favoured domestic scenes, women and warriors. Multiple figures are rare, usually there is ony one figure each on the front and back of the vase, sometimes only the head. Garments are usually drawn casually.<sup id="_ref-Hurschmann228_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hurschmann228" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>After 350 BC, the <a href="/wiki/CA_Painter" id="w">CA Painter</a> and his successors worked in <a href="/wiki/Cumae" id="w">Cumae</a>. The CA painter is considered as the outstanding artist of his group, or even of Campanian vase painting as a whole. From 330 onwards, a strong Apulian influence is visible. The most common motifs are <i>naiskos</i> and grave scenes, dionysiac scenes and symposia. Depictions of bejewelled female heads are also common. The CA painter was polychrome but tended to use much white for architecture and female figures. His successors were not fully able to maintain his quality, leading to a rapid demise, terminating with the end of Campanian vase painting around 300 BC.<sup id="_ref-Hurschmann228_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hurschmann228" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Lucania" name="Lucania"></a><h2> Lucania </h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Lucania" id="w">Lucanian</a> vase painting tradition began around 430 BC, with the works of the <a href="/wiki/Pisticci_Painter" id="w">Pisticci Painter</a>. He was probably active in <a href="/wiki/Pisticci" id="w">Pisticci</a>, where some of his works were discovered. He was strongly influenced by Attic tradition. His successors, the <a href="/wiki/Amykos_Painter" id="w">Amykos Painter</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Cyclops_Painter" id="w">Cyclops Painter</a> had a workshop in <a href="/wiki/Metapontum" id="w">Metapontum</a>. They were the first to paint the new <i>nestoris</i> (see <a href="/wiki/Typology_of_Greek_Vase_Shapes" id="w">Typology of Greek Vase Shapes</a>) vase type. Mythical or theatrical scenes are common. For example, the <a href="/wiki/Cheophoroi_painter" id="w">Cheophoroi painter</a>, named after the <a href="/wiki/Orestia" id="w">Cheophoroi</a> by <a href="/wiki/Aeschylos" id="w">Aeschylos</a> showed scenes from the tragedy in question on several of his vases. The influence of Apulian vase painting becomes tangible roughly at the same time. Especially polychromy and vegetal decor became standard. Important representatives of this style include the <a href="/wiki/Dolon_Painter" id="w">Dolon Painter</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn-Budapest_Painter" id="w">Brooklyn-Budapest Painter</a>. Towards the mid-4th century BC, a massive drop in quality and thematic variety becomes notable. The last notable Lucanian vase painter was the <a href="/wiki/Primato_Painter" id="w">Primato Painter</a>, strongly influenced by the Apulian <a href="/wiki/Lycourgos_Painter" id="w">Lycourgos Painter</a>.

In contrast to black-figure vase painting, red-figure vase painting developed few regional traditions, workshops or &#34;schools&#34; outside Attica and Southern Italy. The few exceptions include some workshops in <a href="/wiki/Boeotia" id="w">Boeotia</a> (<a href="/wiki/Kl%C3%BCgmann_Painter" id="w">Klügmann Painter</a>), <a href="/wiki/Chalkidike" id="w">Chalkidike</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elis" id="w">Elis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eretria" id="w">Eretria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Corinth" id="w">Corinth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Laconia" id="w">Laconia</a>.</p>
<p>Only <a href="/wiki/Etruria" id="w">Etruria</a>, one of the main export markets for Attic vases, developed its own schools and workshops, eventually exporting its own products. The adoption of red-figure painting, imitating Athenian vases, occurred only after 490 BC, half a century after the style had been developed. Because of the technique used, the earliest examples are known as pseudo-red-figure vase paintings. The true red-figure technique was introduced much later, near the end of the 5th century BC. Several painters, workshops and production centres are known for both styles. Their products were not only used locally, but also exported to <a href="/wiki/Malta" id="w">Malta</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carthage" id="w">Carthage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">Rome</a> and <a href="/wiki/Liguria" id="w">Liguria</a>.</p>
<a id="Pseudo-red-figure_vase_painting" name="Pseudo-red-figure_vase_painting"></a><h2> Pseudo-red-figure vase painting </h2>
<p>The early Etrurian examples merely imitated the red-figure technique. Similar to a rare and early Attic technique (see <a href="/wiki/Six%26%2339%3Bs_technique" id="w">Six&#39;s technique</a>), the whole vassel was covered with black glossy clay and figures were applied afterwards using mineral colours that would oxidise red or white. Thus, in contrast to contemporary Attic vase painting, the red colour was not achieved by leaving areas unpainted but by adding paint to the black prime layer. Like in black-figure vases, internal detail was not painted on, but incised into the figures. Important representatives of this style include the <a href="/wiki/Praxias_Painter" id="w">Praxias Painter</a> and other masters from his workshop in <a href="/wiki/Vulci" id="w">Vulci</a>. In spite of their evident good knowledge of Greek myth and iconography, there is no evidence to indicate that these painters had immigrated from Attica.</p>
<p>In Etruria, the pseudo-red-figure style was not just a phenomenon of the earliest phases, as it had been in Attica. Especially during the 4th century, some workshops specialised in this technique, although true red-figure painting was widespread among Etrurian workshops at the same time. Notable workshops include the <a href="/wiki/Sokra_Group" id="w">Sokra Group</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Phantom_Group" id="w">Phantom Group</a>. The Sokra Group, somewhat older, preferred bowls with interior decoration of Greek mythical themes, but also some Etruscan motifs. The phantom Group mainly painted cloaked figures combined with vegetal or palmette ornamentation. The workshops of both groups are suspected to have been in <a href="/wiki/Caere" id="w">Caere</a>, <a href="/wiki/Falerii" id="w">Falerii</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tarquinia" id="w">Tarquinia</a>. The Phantom Group produced until the early 3rd century BC. Like elsewhere, the changing tastes of the customers eventually led to the end of this style.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>

True red figure vase painting, ie. vases were the red areas had been left unpainted, was introduced to Etruria near the end of the 5th century BC. The first workshops developed in Vulci and Falerii and produced also for the surrounding areas. It is likely that Attic masters were behind these early workshops, but a <a href="/wiki/South_Italian" id="w">South Italian</a> influence is evident, too. These workshops dominated the Etruscan market into the 4th century BC. Large and medium-sized vessels like <i>kraters</i> and jugs were decorated mostly with mythological scenes. In the course of the 4th century, the Falerian production began to eclipse that of Vulci. New centres of production developed in <a href="/wiki/Chiusi" id="w">Chiusi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Orvieto" id="w">Orvieto</a>. Especially the <a href="/wiki/Tondo_Group" id="w">Tondo Group</a> of Chiusi, producing mainly drinking vessels with interior depictions of dionysiac scenes, became important. During the second half of the century, <a href="/wiki/Volterra" id="w">Volterra</a> became a main centre. Here, especially rod-handled <i>kraters</i> were produced and, especially in the early phases, painted elaborately.  </p>
<p>During the 2nd half of the 4th century BC, mythological themes disappeared from the repertoire of Etruscan painters. They were replaced by female heads and scenes of up to two figures. Instead of figural depictions, ornaments and floral motifs covered the vessel bodies. Large figural compositions, like that on a <i>krater</i> by the <a href="/wiki/Den_Haag_Funnel_Group_Painter" id="w">Den Haag Funnel Group Painter</a> were only produced exceptionally. The originally large-scale production at Falerii lost its dominant role to the production centre at Caere, which had probably been founded by Falerian painters and cannot be said to represent a distinct tradition. The standard repertoire of the Caere workshops included simply painted <i>oinochoai</i>, <i>lekythoi</i> and drinking bowls of the <a href="/wiki/Torcop_Group" id="w">Torcop Group</a>, and plates of the <a href="/wiki/Genucuilia_Group" id="w">Genucuilia Group</a>. The switch to the production of black glaze vases near the end of the 4th century, probably as a reaction to changing tastes of the time, spelt the end of Etrurian red-figure vase painting.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Research_and_Reception" name="Research_and_Reception"></a><h1> Research and Reception </h1>
<p>About 65,000 red-figure vases and vase fragments are known to have survived<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>. The study of ancient pottery and of Greek vase painting began already in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a>. <a href="/wiki/Restoro_d%26%2339%3BArezzo" id="w">Restoro d&#39;Arezzo</a> dedicated a chapter (<i>Capitolo de le vasa antiche</i>) of his description of the world to ancient vases. He considered especially the clay vessels as perfect in terms of shape, colour, and artistic style.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Nevertheless, intially the attention focused on vases in general, and perhaps especially on stone vases. The first collections of ancient vases, including some painted vessels, developed during the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" id="w">Renaissance</a>. We even know of some imports from Greece to Italy at that time. Still, until the end of the <a href="/wiki/Baroque" id="w">Baroque</a> period, vase painting was overshadowed by other genres, especially by <a href="/wiki/Greek_sculpture" id="w">sculpture</a>. A rare pre-<a href="/wiki/Classicist" id="w">Classicist</a> exception is a book of <a href="/wiki/Watercolour" id="w">watercolours</a> depicting figural vases, which was produced for <a href="/wiki/Nicolas-Claude_Fabri_de_Peiresc" id="w">Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc</a>. Like some of his contemporary collectors, Peiresc owned a number of clay vases.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since the period of <a href="/wiki/Classicism" id="w">Classicism</a>, ceramic vessels were collected more frequently. For example, <a href="/wiki/William_Hamilton" id="w">William Hamilton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Giuseppe_Valletta" id="w">Giuseppe Valletta</a> had vase collections. Vases found in Italy were relatively affordable, so that even private individuals could assemble important collections. Vases were a popular souvenir for young northwestern Europeans to bring home from the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Tour" id="w">Grand Tour</a>. In the diaries of his voyageto Italy <sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup>, <a href="/wiki/Goethe" id="w">Goethe</a> refers to the temptation of buying ancient vases. Those who could not afford originals had the option of acquiring copies or prints. There were even <a href="/wiki/Manufactory" id="w">manufactories</a> specialised in imitating ancient pottery. The best known is <a href="/wiki/Wedgwood" id="w">Wedgwood</a> ware, although it employed techniques entirely unrelated to those used in antiquity, using ancient motifs merely as a thematic inspiration.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since the 1760s, archaeological research also began to focus on vase paintings. The vases were appreciated as source material for all aspects of ancient life, especially for <a href="/wiki/Iconography" id="w">iconographical</a> and <a href="/wiki/Greek_mythology" id="w">mythological</a> studies. Vase painting was now treated as a substitute for the almost entirely lost oeuvre of <a href="/wiki/Art_in_ancient_Greece#Wall painting" id="w">Greek monumental painting</a>. Around this time, the widespread view that all painted vases were Etruscan works became untenable. Nonetheless, the artistic fashion of that time to imitate ancient vases came to be called <i>all’etrusque</i>. England and France tried to outdo each other in terms of both research and imitation of vases. The German aesthetic writers <a href="/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_M%C3%BCntz" id="w">Johann Heinrich Müntz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Johann_Joachim_Winckelmann" id="w">Johann Joachim Winckelmann</a> studied vase paintings. Winckelmann especially praised the <i>Umrißlinienstil</i> (&#34;outline style&#34;, i.e. red-figure painting). Vase ornaments were compiled and disseminated in England through <i>Pattern books</i>.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Vase paintings even had an influence on the development of modern painting. The linear style influenced artists such as <a href="/wiki/Edward_Burne-Jones" id="w">Edward Burne-Jones</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gustave_Moreau" id="w">Gustave Moreau</a> or <a href="/wiki/Gustav_Klimt" id="w">Gustav Klimt</a>. Around 1840, <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_Georg_Waldm%C3%BCller" id="w">Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller</a> painted a <i>Still Life with Silver Vessels and Red-Figure Bell Krater</i>. <a href="/wiki/Henri_Matisse" id="w">Henri Matisse</a> produced a similar painting (<i>Intérieur au vase étrusque</i>). Their aesthetic influence extends into the present. For example, the well-known curved shape of the Coca Cola bottle is inspired by Greek vases.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>The scientific study of Attic vase paintings was advanced especially by <a href="/wiki/John_Beazley" id="w">John D. Beazley</a>. Beazley began to study the vases from about 1910 onwards, inspired by the methodology that the <a href="/wiki/Art_historian" id="w">art historian</a> <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Morelli" id="w">Giovanni Morelli</a> had developed for the study of paintings. He assumed that each painter produced individual works that can always be unmistakably ascribed. To do so, particular details, such as faces, fingers, arms, legs, knees, garment folds and so on, were compared. Beazley examined 65,000 vases and fragments (of which 20,000 were black-figure). In the course of six decades of study, he was able to ascribe 17,000 of them to individual artists. Where their names remained unknown, he developed a system of conventional names. Beazley also united and combined individual painters into groups, workshops, schools and styles. No other archaeologist has ever had as formative an influence on a whole subdiscipline as had Beazley on the study of Greek vase painting. A large proportion of his analysis is still considered valid today. Beazley first published his conclusions on red-figure vase painting in 1925 and 1942. His initial studies only considered material from before the 4th century BC. For a new edition of his work published in 1963, he also incorporated that later period, making use of the work of other scholars, such as <a href="/wiki/Karl_Schefold" id="w">Karl Schefold</a>, who had especially studied the <a href="/wiki/Kerch_Style" id="w">Kerch Style</a> vases. Famous scholars who continued the study of Attic red-figure after Beazley include <a href="/wiki/John_Boardman" id="w">John Boardman</a>, <a href="/wiki/Erika_Simon" id="w">Erika Simon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dietrich_von_Bothmer" id="w">Dietrich von Bothmer</a>.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>For the study of <a href="/wiki/South_Italian" id="w">South Italian</a> case painting, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Dale_Trendall" id="w">Arthur Dale Trendall</a>&#39;s work has a similar significance to that of Beazley for Attica. All post-Beazley scholars can be said to follow Beazley&#39;s tradition and use his methodology. The study of Greek vases is ongoing, not least because of the constant addition of new material from <a href="/wiki/Excavation" id="w">archaeological excavations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illicit_antiquities" id="w">illicit excavations</a> and unknown private collections.</p>
