<p><b>Archimedes of Syracuse</b> (<a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a>: {{polytonic}}) (<i>c</i>. 287&#160;BC &#8211; <i>c.</i> 212&#160;BC) was an <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" id="w">ancient Greek</a> <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" id="w">mathematician</a>, <a href="/wiki/Physicist" id="w">physicist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Astronomer" id="w">astronomer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Engineer" id="w">engineer</a>. Although little is known of his life, he is regarded as one of the leading <a href="/wiki/Scientist" id="w">scientists</a> in <a href="/wiki/Classical_antiquity" id="w">classical antiquity</a>. Among his advances in <a href="/wiki/Physics" id="w">physics</a> are the foundations of <a href="/wiki/Hydrostatics" id="w">hydrostatics</a> and the explanation of the principle of the <a href="/wiki/Lever" id="w">lever</a>.
His early use of <a href="/wiki/Calculus" id="w">calculus</a> included the first known <a href="/wiki/Summation" id="w">summation</a> of an <a href="/wiki/Infinite_series" id="w">infinite series</a> with a method that is still used today.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> He is also credited with designing innovative <a href="/wiki/Machine" id="w">machines</a>, including weapons and the screw pump that bears his name. He is best known for allegedly exclaiming &#34;<a href="/wiki/Eureka_(word)" id="w">Eureka!</a>&#34; after discovering what is known today as <a href="/wiki/Buoyancy" id="w">Archimedes&#39; principle</a>.</p>
<p>Archimedes died during the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Syracuse_(212_BC)" id="w">Siege of Syracuse</a>, when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed.  At his request his tombstone was carved with a <a href="/wiki/Sphere" id="w">sphere</a> contained within a <a href="/wiki/Cylinder" id="w">cylinder</a> and inscribed with the <a href="/wiki/Ratio" id="w">ratio</a> of the cylinder&#39;s volume to that of the sphere. Archimedes considered the discovery of this ratio the greatest of all his accomplishments. The relatively few copies of his treatises that survived through the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a> were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" id="w">Renaissance</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>
The historians of <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">Ancient Rome</a> showed a strong interest in Archimedes and wrote accounts of his life and works, while the discovery of previously unknown works by Archimedes in the <a href="/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest" id="w">Archimedes Palimpsest</a> has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

Archimedes was born <i>c</i>. 287&#160;BC in the seaport city of <a href="/wiki/Syracuse%2C_Sicily" id="w">Syracuse, Sicily</a>, at that time a colony of <a href="/wiki/Magna_Graecia" id="w">Magna Graecia</a>.

<p>Archimedes died <i>c</i>. 212 BC during the <a href="/wiki/Second_Punic_War" id="w">Second Punic War</a>, when Roman forces under General <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus" id="w">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> captured the city of Syracuse after a two year long <a href="/wiki/Siege" id="w">siege</a>. According to the popular account given by Plutarch, Archimedes was contemplating a mathematical diagram when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem. The soldier was enraged by this, and killed Archimedes with his sword. Plutarch also gives a {{nowrap}} account of the death of Archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier. According to this story, Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments, and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items. General Marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of Archimedes, as he had ordered him not to be harmed.<sup id="_ref-death_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-death" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The last words attributed to Archimedes are &#34;Do not disturb my circles&#34; (<a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a>: μή μου τούς κύκλους τάραττε), a reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the Roman soldier.

<div class="thumbcaption">The sphere has 2/3 the surface area and volume of the circumscribing cylinder. A sphere and cylinder were carved on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.</div>
The tomb of Archimedes had a carving of his favorite mathematical diagram, which was a <a href="/wiki/Sphere" id="w">sphere</a> inside a <a href="/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)" id="w">cylinder</a> of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proved that the volume and surface area of the sphere would be two thirds that of the cylinder. In 75 BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman <a href="/wiki/Orator" id="w">orator</a> <a href="/wiki/Cicero" id="w">Cicero</a> was serving as <a href="/wiki/Quaestor" id="w">quaestor</a> in <a href="/wiki/Sicily" id="w">Sicily</a>. He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, but none of the locals was able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The standard versions of the life of Archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of Ancient Rome. The account of the siege of Syracuse given by <a href="/wiki/Polybius" id="w">Polybius</a> in his <i>Universal History</i> was written around seventy years after Archimedes&#39; death, and was used subsequently as a source by Plutarch and <a href="/wiki/Livy" id="w">Livy</a>. It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Discoveries_and_inventions" name="Discoveries_and_inventions"></a><h1>Discoveries and inventions</h1>
<p>The most commonly related <a href="/wiki/Anecdote" id="w">anecdote</a> about Archimedes tells how he invented a method for measuring the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to <a href="/wiki/Vitruvius" id="w">Vitruvius</a>, a new crown in the shape of a <a href="/wiki/Laurel_wreath" id="w">laurel wreath</a> had been made for <a href="/wiki/Hiero_II_of_Syracuse" id="w">King Hiero II</a>, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether it was of solid <a href="/wiki/Gold" id="w">gold</a>, or whether <a href="/wiki/Silver" id="w">silver</a> had been added by a dishonest goldsmith.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down in order to measure its <a href="/wiki/Density" id="w">density</a> as a cube, which would have been the simplest solution. While taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water rose as he got in. He realized that this effect could be used to determine the <a href="/wiki/Volume" id="w">volume</a> of the crown, and therefore its density after weighing it. The density of the crown would be lower if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. He then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying &#34;<a href="/wiki/Eureka_(word)" id="w">Eureka</a>!&#34; &#34;I have found it!&#34; (<a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a>: &#34;εύρηκα!&#34;)<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The story about the golden crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes, but in his treatise <i>On Floating Bodies</i> he gives the principle known in <a href="/wiki/Hydrostatics" id="w">hydrostatics</a> as <a href="/wiki/Archimedes%26%2339%3B_Principle" id="w">Archimedes&#39; Principle</a>. This states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>While Archimedes did not invent the <a href="/wiki/Lever" id="w">lever</a>, he wrote the earliest known rigorous explanation of the principle involved. According to <a href="/wiki/Pappus_of_Alexandria" id="w">Pappus of Alexandria</a>, his work on levers caused him to remark: &#34;Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth.&#34; (<a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a>: &#34;δος μοι πα στω και ταν γαν κινάσω&#34;)<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Plutarch describes how Archimedes designed <a href="/wiki/Block_and_tackle" id="w">block and tackle</a> <a href="/wiki/Pulley" id="w">pulley</a> systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of <a href="/wiki/Leverage" id="w">leverage</a> to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>

A large part of Archimedes&#39; work in engineering arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. The Greek writer <a href="/wiki/Athenaeus" id="w">Athenaeus of Naucratis</a> described how King Hieron II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the <i><a href="/wiki/Syracusia" id="w">Syracusia</a></i>, which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship. The <i>Syracusia</i> is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a <a href="/wiki/Gymnasium_(ancient_Greece)" id="w">gymnasium</a> and a temple dedicated to the goddess <a href="/wiki/Aphrodite" id="w">Aphrodite</a> among its facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the <a href="/wiki/Archimedes%26%2339%3B_screw" id="w">Archimedes&#39; screw</a> was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. The screw was a machine with a revolving screw shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a {{nowrap}} body of water into irrigation canals. Versions of the Archimedes&#39; screw are still in use today in developing countries. The Archimedes&#39; screw described in Roman times by Vitruvius may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the <a href="/wiki/Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon" id="w">Hanging Gardens of Babylon</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Claw_of_Archimedes" id="w">Claw of Archimedes</a> is another weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of Syracuse. Also known as &#34;the ship shaker&#34;, the claw consisted of a crane-like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended. When the claw was dropped on to an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards, lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it. There have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw, and in 2005 a television documentary entitled <i>Superweapons of the Ancient World</i> built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the <a href="/wiki/Catapult" id="w">catapult</a>, and with inventing the <a href="/wiki/Odometer" id="w">odometer</a> during the <a href="/wiki/First_Punic_War" id="w">First Punic War</a>. The odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cicero" id="w">Cicero</a> (106&#160;BC&#8211;43&#160;BC) mentions Archimedes briefly in his <a href="/wiki/Dialogue" id="w">dialogue</a> <i><a href="/wiki/De_re_publica" id="w">De re publica</a></i>, which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129&#160;BC. After the capture of Syracuse <i>c.</i> 212&#160;BC, General <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus" id="w">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms used as aids in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets.  Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by <a href="/wiki/Thales" id="w">Thales of Miletus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus" id="w">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a>. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus&#39; mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by <a href="/wiki/Gaius_Sulpicius_Gallus" id="w">Gaius Sulpicius Gallus</a> to <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Furius_Philus" id="w">Lucius Furius Philus</a>, who described it thus: </p>

Modern research in this area has been focused on the <a href="/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism" id="w">Antikythera mechanism</a>, another device from classical antiquity that was probably designed for the same purpose. Constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated knowledge of <a href="/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)" id="w">differential gearing</a>.

This claim, sometimes called the &#34;Archimedes death ray&#34;, has been the subject of ongoing debate about its credibility since the Renaissance. <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes" id="w">René Descartes</a> rejected it as false, while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup>
It has been suggested that a large array of highly polished <a href="/wiki/Bronze" id="w">bronze</a> or <a href="/wiki/Copper" id="w">copper</a> shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight on to a ship. This would have used the principle of the <a href="/wiki/Parabolic_reflector" id="w">parabolic reflector</a> in a manner similar to a <a href="/wiki/Solar_furnace" id="w">solar furnace</a>.</p>
<p>In October 2005 a group of students from the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" id="w">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30&#160;cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a {{nowrap}} wooden ship at a range of around 100&#160;feet (30&#160;m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the weapon was a feasible device under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show <i><a href="/wiki/MythBusters" id="w">MythBusters</a></i>, using a wooden fishing boat in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" id="w">San Francisco</a> as the target. Again some charring occurred, along with a small amount of flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its <a href="/wiki/Flash_point" id="w">flash point</a>, which is around 300 degrees Celsius (570 °F), and this is hotter than the maximum temperature produced by a domestic oven.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup>
When <i>Mythbusters</i> broadcast the result of the San Francisco experiment in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of &#34;busted&#34; (or &#34;failed&#34;) due to of the length of time and ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p> 
<p>A similar test of the &#34;Archimedes death ray&#34; was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Ioannis Sakkas. The experiment took place at the <a href="/wiki/Skaramagas" id="w">Skaramagas</a> naval base outside <a href="/wiki/Athens" id="w">Athens</a>. On this occasion 70 mirrors were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet (1.5 by 1&#160;m). The mirrors were pointed at a plywood  {{nowrap}} of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160&#160;feet (50&#160;m). When the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds.

<p>While he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices, Archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics. <a href="/wiki/Plutarch" id="w">Plutarch</a> wrote: “He placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no reference to the vulgar needs of life.”<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Archimedes used the <a href="/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion" id="w">method of exhaustion</a> to approximate the value of <a href="/wiki/Pi" id="w">π</a>.</div>
Archimedes was able to use <a href="/wiki/Infinitesimals" id="w">infinitesimals</a> in a way that is similar to modern <a href="/wiki/Integral_calculus" id="w">integral calculus</a>. By assuming a proposition to be true and showing that this would lead to a <a href="/wiki/Contradiction" id="w">contradiction</a>, he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the <a href="/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion" id="w">method of exhaustion</a>, and he employed it to approximate the value of <a href="/wiki/Pi" id="w">π</a> (Pi). He did this by drawing a larger <a href="/wiki/Polygon" id="w">polygon</a> outside a <a href="/wiki/Circle" id="w">circle</a> and a smaller polygon inside the circle. As the number of sides of the polygon increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. When the polygons had 96 sides each, he calculated the lengths of their sides and showed that the value of π lay between {{nowrap}} (approximately 3.1429) and {{nowrap}} (approximately 3.1408). He also proved that the <a href="/wiki/Area" id="w">area</a> of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the <a href="/wiki/Square_(geometry)" id="w">square</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Radius" id="w">radius</a> of the circle.</p>
<p>In <i>The Measurement of a Circle</i>, Archimedes gives the value of the <a href="/wiki/Square_root" id="w">square root</a> of 3 as being more than {{nowrap}} (approximately 1.732) and less than {{nowrap}} (approximately 1.7320512). The actual value is around 1.7320508076, making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without offering any explanation of the method used to obtain it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused <a href="/wiki/John_Wallis" id="w">John Wallis</a> to remark that he was: &#34;as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results.&#34;<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup>

<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Quadrature_of_the_Parabola" id="w">The Quadrature of the Parabola</a></i>, Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a <a href="/wiki/Parabola" id="w">parabola</a> and a straight line is 4/3 multiplied by the area of a <a href="/wiki/Triangle_(geometry)" id="w">triangle</a> with equal base and height.

<dl><dd><span class="math">\sum_{n=0}^\infty 4^{-n} = 1 + 4^{-1} + 4^{-2} + 4^{-3} + \cdots = {4\over 3}. \;</span></dd></dl>
<p>If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller <a href="/wiki/Secant_line" id="w">secant lines</a>, and so on.

<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sand_Reckoner" id="w">The Sand Reckoner</a></i>, Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote: &#34;There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of <a href="/wiki/Hiero_II" id="w">Hiero II</a>), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited.&#34; To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based around the <a href="/wiki/Myriad" id="w">myriad</a>. The word is based on the Greek for uncountable, <i>murious</i>, and was also used to denote the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of myriad myriads (100 million) and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8{{e}} in modern notation.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>

<li><i>On the Measurement of the Circle</i></li></ul><dl><dd>This is a short work consisting of three propositions. It is written in the form of a correspondence with Dositheus of Pelusium, who was a student of <a href="/wiki/Conon_of_Samos" id="w">Conon of Samos</a>.

<li><i>On the Sphere and the Cylinder</i> (two volumes)</li></ul><dl><dd>In this treatise addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes obtains the result of which he was most proud, namely the relationship between a <a href="/wiki/Sphere" id="w">sphere</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Circumscribe" id="w">circumscribed</a> <a href="/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)" id="w">cylinder</a> of the same height and <a href="/wiki/Diameter" id="w">diameter</a>.

<li><i>On Floating Bodies</i> (two volumes)</li></ul><dl><dd>In the first part of this treatise, Archimedes spells out the law of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Equilibrium">equilibrium</a> of fluids, and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around a center of gravity. This may have been an attempt at explaining the theory of contemporary Greek astronomers such as <a href="/wiki/Eratosthenes" id="w">Eratosthenes</a> that the Earth is round. The fluids described by Archimedes are not {{nowrap}}, since he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall in order to derive the spherical shape.</dd></dl>

A <a href="/wiki/Palimpsest" id="w">palimpsest</a>, from the Greek word <i>palimpsestos</i> meaning &#34;scraped again&#34;, is a manuscript written on parchment that has another text written over it, leaving two (or more) layers of visible writing. Palimpsests were common in antiquity because parchment was scarce and costly. As certain kinds of texts went in and out of literary fashion the manuscripts were recycled and reused, with their original content being rubbed away and overwritten.  In 1906, the Danish professor <a href="/wiki/Johan_Ludvig_Heiberg_(1854-1928)" id="w">Johan Ludvig Heiberg</a> realized that a goatskin parchment of prayers written in the 13th century AD also carried an older work written in the 10th century AD, which he identified as previously unknown copies of works by Archimedes. The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" id="w">Constantinople</a> before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s. On <a href="/wiki/October_29" id="w">October 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a> it was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for $2 million at <a href="/wiki/Christie%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">Christie&#39;s</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>. The palimpsest holds seven treatises, including the only surviving copy of <i>On Floating Bodies</i> in the original Greek. It is the only known source of the <i>Method of Mechanical Theorems</i>, referred to by Suidas and thought to have been lost forever. <i>Stomachion</i> was also discovered in the palimpsest, with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had been found in previous texts.
