<b>Affluence in the United States</b> refers to an individual&#39;s or household&#39;s state of being in an economically favorable position in contrast to a given <a href="/wiki/Reference_group" id="w">reference group</a>.<sup id="_ref-Cambridge International Dictionary of English_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cambridge International Dictionary of English" title="">[3]</a></sup> While there are no precise guidelines or thresholds for what may be considered affluent, the United States Department of Commerce&#39;s Bureau of the Census does provide detailed statistical data on the economic state of America&#39;s population. <a href="/wiki/Income_in_the_United_States" id="w">Income</a>, measured either by <a href="/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">household</a> or <a href="/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">individual</a>, is perhaps the most commonly used measure for whether or not a given entity may be considered affluent.

These two figures should be seen only as guidlines based upon the top 1% of a population because net worth exceeding 1 million may be increasingly inaccurate as an <a href="/wiki/Upper_class" id="w">upper class</a> indicator as the value of the dollar falls and inflation along with interest and the turn of the century&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Housing_bubble" id="w">real estate boom</a> causes more and more people to self-classify as <a href="/wiki/Millionaires" id="w">millionaires</a>.</p>
<p>The US Census Bureau offers <a href="/wiki/Income_in_the_United_States" id="w">income data</a> by household and individual.

<p>Overall the term affluent may be applied to a variety of individuals, households or other entities depending on context. Data from the US Census Bureau serves as the main guideline for defining affluence. US government data not only reveals the nation&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Income_in_the_United_States" id="w">income distribution</a> but also provides data regarding the demographic characteristics of those to whom the term, affluent, may be applied.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, income quintile and top 5% household income distribution and demographic characteristics, 2006_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, income quintile and top 5% household income distribution and demographic characteristics, 2006" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Top_percentiles" name="Top_percentiles"></a><h2>Top percentiles</h2>
<p>Affluence and economic standing within society is often expressed in terms of percentile ranking. Economic ranking is conducted either in terms of giving lower thresholds for a designated group (e.g. the top 5%, 10%, 15%, etc.) or in terms of the percentage of households/individuals with incomes above a certain thresholds (e.g. above $75,000, $100,000, $150,000, etc.). The table below presents 2006 income data in terms of the lower thresholds for the given percentages (e.g. the top 25.6% of households had incomes exceeding $80,000, compared to $47,000 for the top quarter of individuals).<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, personal income distribution, age 25+, 2006_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, personal income distribution, age 25+, 2006" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, overall household income distribution, 2006_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, overall household income distribution, 2006" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

While households with just one income earner, most commonly the male, were the norm in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, 42% of all households and the vast majority of married couple households now have two or more income earners.

<p>Two income earner households are far more common among the <a href="/wiki/Income_quintiles" id="w">top quintile</a> of households than the general population. 2006 US Census Bureau data indicates that over three quarters, 76%, of households in the top quintile, with <a href="/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">annual incomes</a> exceeding $91,200, had two or more income earners compared to just 42% among the general population and a small minority in the <a href="/wiki/Income_quintiles" id="w">bottom three quintiles</a>. As a result much of the rising <a href="/wiki/Income_in_the_United_States" id="w">income</a> inequity between the upper and lower percentiles can be explained through the increasing percentage of households with two or more incomes.<sup id="_ref-Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, income quintilea and Top 5 Percent, 2004_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, income quintilea and Top 5 Percent, 2004" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

The vast majority of Americans derive the majority of their income from occupational earnings. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Income_in_the_United_States" id="w">Income</a> derived from an occupation is largely determined by scarcity and the economic law of <a href="/wiki/Supply_and_demand" id="w">supply and demand</a>. The more demand for a certain specialty and the less supply, the higher the income. There has been shown to be a correlation between increases in income and increases in worker satisfaction. The decrease in worker dissatisfaction, however, is not solely a result of the increase in income. Workers in more complex and <a href="/wiki/Social_structure_of_the_United_States" id="w">higher level</a> occupations tend to have <a href="/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" id="w">attained higher levels of education</a> and thus are more likely to have a greater degree of autonomy in the workplace.<sup id="_ref-Occupation and Class Consciousness in America_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Occupation and Class Consciousness in America" title="">[15]</a></sup> Additionally higher level workers with advanced degrees are hired to share their personal knowledge, to conceptualize, and to consult.

<a href="/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" id="w">Educational attainment</a> plays a major factor in determining an individual&#39;s economic disposition. Personal income varied greatly according to an individual&#39;s education, as did household income.

<a id="Social_class" name="Social_class"></a><h2>Social class</h2>
<p>Economic well-being is often associated with high <a href="/wiki/Social_structure_of_the_United_States" id="w">societal status</a>, yet one needs to remember that <a href="/wiki/Income_in_the_United_States" id="w">income and economic compensation</a> of any sort are first and foremost the result of scarcity and may only act as an indicator of social class. It is in the interest of society that all open positions are adequately filled with the occupant being enticed to do his or her best.<sup id="_ref-Society in Focus_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society in Focus" title="">[7]</a></sup> As a result an occupation that requires a scarce skill, the attainment of which is often documented through an <a href="/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" id="w">educational degree</a>, and entrusts its occupant with a high degree of influence will feature high economic compensation. The high income is meant to ensure that individuals obtain the necessary skills (e.g. medical or graduate school) and complete their tasks with the necessary valor.<sup id="_ref-Social Class and Stratification_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Social Class and Stratification" title="">[35]</a></sup> Differences in income may, however, be found among occupations of similar sociological nature. The median annual earnings of a physican were in excess of $150,000 in May 2004, compared to $95,000 for an attorney.<sup id="_ref-US Department of Labor, annual earnings for doctors_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Department of Labor, annual earnings for doctors" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Bureau of Labor statistics data published by Monster.com, 20 highest paying jobs_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bureau of Labor statistics data published by Monster.com, 20 highest paying jobs" title="">[18]</a></sup> Both occupations require finely tuned and scarce skill sets and both are essential to the well-being of society. Yet, family doctors outearned attorneys and other <a href="/wiki/American_middle_class#Professional/Managerial middle class" id="w">upper middle class</a> professionals by a wide margin as their skill-sets are deemed especially scarce. Overall, high status positions tend to be those requiring a scarce skill and are therefore commonly far better compensated than those in the middle of the occupational strata.<sup id="_ref-Society in Focus_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society in Focus" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Social Class and Stratification_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Social Class and Stratification" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

<p>It is important to remember that the above is an <a href="/wiki/Ideal_type" id="w">ideal type</a>, a simplified model or reality using optimal circumstances. In reality other factors such as discrimination based on race, ethnicity and gender as well as aggressive political lobbying by certain professional organizations also influence personal income. An individual personal live and the thereon based career decisions as well as his or her personal connections (often attained through &#34;networking&#34;) witin the nation&#39;s economic institutions are also likely to have an effect on income, <a href="/wiki/Social_structure_of_the_United_States" id="w">status</a> and whether or not an individual may be referred to as affluent.<sup id="_ref-The Inner Life of the Middle Class_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Inner Life of the Middle Class" title="">[6]</a></sup> In contemporary America it is a combination of all these factors, with scarcity remaining the by far most prominent one, determine a person&#39;s economic compensation. Due to higher status professions requiring advanced and thus less commonly found skill sets (including the ability to supervise and work with a considerable autonomy) are better compensated through the means of income, making high status individuals relatively affluent, depending on <a href="/wiki/Reference_group" id="w">reference group</a>.<sup id="_ref-Society in Focus_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society in Focus" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>While the two paragraphs above only describe the relationship between status and personal income, household income is also often used to infer status. As a result, the dual income phenomenon presents yet another problem in equating affluence with high <a href="/wiki/Social_structure_of_the_United_States" id="w">societal status</a>. As mentioned earlier in the article 42% of households have two or more income earners, 76% of households with <a href="/wiki/Six_figure_income" id="w">six figure incomes</a> have two or more <a href="/wiki/Income_earner" id="w">income earners</a>.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, income quintile and top 5% household income distribution and demographic characteristics, 2006_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, income quintile and top 5% household income distribution and demographic characteristics, 2006" title="">[8]</a></sup> Furthermore people are most likely to marry their professional and societal equals. It therefore becomes apparent that the majority of households with <a href="/wiki/Income_in_the_United_States" id="w">incomes</a> exceeding the six figure mark are the result of an economic as well as personal union between two economic equals. Today, two nurses, each making $55,000 a year, can easily outearn a single attorney who makes the median of $95,000 annually.<sup id="_ref-US Department of Labor, median income of registered nurses_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Department of Labor, median income of registered nurses" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Bureau of Labor statistics data published by Monster.com, 20 highest paying jobs_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bureau of Labor statistics data published by Monster.com, 20 highest paying jobs" title="">[18]</a></sup> Despite household income rising drastically through the union of two economic equals, neither individual has advanced his or her function and position within society. Yet the household (not individual) may have become more affluent, assuming an increase in <a href="/wiki/Median_income_per_household_member" id="w">household members</a> does not off-set the dual-income derived gains.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The wide income discrepancies within the top 1.5% of households.</div></div>

Today there are approximately 146,000 (0.1%) households with incomes exceeding $1,500,000, while the top 0.01% or 11,000 households had incomes exceeding $5,500,000. The 400 highest tax payers in the nation had gross annual household incomes exceeding $87,000,000. Household incomes for this group have risen more dramatically than for any other. As a result the gap between those who make less than one and half million dollars annually (99.9% of households) and those who make more (0.1%) has been steadily increasing, prompting <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">The New York Times</a></i> to proclaim that the &#34;Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind.&#34; Indeed the income disparities within the top 1.5% are quite drastic. While households in the top 1.5% of households had incomes exceeding $250,000, 443% above the national median, their incomes were still 2200% lower than those of the top .01% of houseolds. One can therefore conclude that any household, even those with incomes of $250,000 annually are relatively poor when compared to the top .1%, who in turn are relatively poor compared to the top 0.000267%, the top 400 taxpaying households.<sup id="_ref-The New York Times, Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The New York Times, Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
