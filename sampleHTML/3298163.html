<b>Hurricane Irene</b> was a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">hurricane</a> that produced moderate damage across southern <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a> during the <a href="/wiki/1999_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1999 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. The ninth tropical storm and the sixth hurricane of the season, Irene developed in the western <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_13" id="w">October 13</a> from a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a>. It moved northward, hitting western <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a> before attaining hurricane status. Irene struck Florida as a <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 1 hurricane</a>, moved across the state, and moved northward over the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Stream" id="w">Gulf Stream</a>. It approached the <a href="/wiki/Carolinas" id="w">Carolinas</a> but remained offshore. Irene turned eastward, and rapidly intensified to reach <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 2</a> Hurricane Status before becoming extratropical due to cooler waters.</p>
<p>The hurricane first produced heavy rainfall across western Cuba, causing four deaths and damage. Irene was a wet Florida hurricane in October, similar to many hurricanes of the 1930s and 1940s.<sup id="_ref-tcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> The hurricane produced 10 to 20&#160;inches (255 to 510&#160;mm) of rainfall in the <a href="/wiki/Miami%2C_Florida" id="w">Miami</a> metropolitan area, causing urban flooding unseen since <a href="/wiki/1981_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Hurricane Dennis" id="w">Tropical Storm Dennis</a> in 1981. Despite being only a Category 1 hurricane, Irene caused 8 indirect deaths and $800&#160;million (1999 <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">USD</a>) in damage across Florida.<sup id="_ref-summary_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-summary" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The hurricane produced flooding and caused one death in the northwestern <a href="/wiki/Bahamas" id="w">Bahamas</a>. In <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> and <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a>, Irene produced heavy rainfall of over 10&#160;inches (255&#160;mm), adding more flooding after previous Hurricanes <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Dennis_(1999)" id="w">Dennis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Floyd" id="w">Floyd</a>. The flooding closed many roads, and caused rivers to crest past their banks, though damage in the area was relatively minor.</p>

A <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">broad area of low pressure</a> formed over the western <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_8" id="w">October 8</a>, and it persisted until <a href="/wiki/October_11" id="w">October 11</a>, when a tropical wave reached the area and caused the <a href="/wiki/Convection" id="w">convection</a> to organize, resulting in the development of a low-level circulation. Convection increased and organized around the circulation&#39;s center late on <a href="/wiki/October_12" id="w">October 12</a>, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on <a href="/wiki/October_13" id="w">October 13</a> off the north coast of <a href="/wiki/Honduras" id="w">Honduras</a>. The depression continued to organize over the favorable conditions present in the Caribbean Sea, and attained tropical storm status later on the 13th, when it was assigned the name Irene.<sup id="_ref-tcr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> Operationally, the system remained a tropical wave until it already reached tropical storm strength.<sup id="_ref-tsdisc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tsdisc" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Tropical Storm Irene strengthened as it moved northward, and reached maximum sustained winds of 70&#160;mph (115&#160;km/h) early on <a href="/wiki/October_14" id="w">October 14</a>. Operationally, Irene was upgraded to a hurricane on the 14th, although later analysis after the hurricane season indicated it remained a tropical storm until later. Irene continued to move towards the north-northeast, crossed over the western portion of the <a href="/wiki/Isla_de_la_Juventud" id="w">Isla de la Juventud</a> as a strong tropical storm, and hours later, it struck mainland <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a> near <a href="/wiki/Batabano" id="w">Batabano</a>. The storm was able to strengthen further over the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Straits" id="w">Florida Straits</a>, and Irene attained hurricane status on <a href="/wiki/October_15" id="w">October 15</a>. It passed over <a href="/wiki/Key_West" id="w">Key West</a>, turned more to the north-northeast, and struck mainland <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a> at <a href="/wiki/Cape_Sable" id="w">Cape Sable</a> as an 80&#160;mph (130&#160;km/h) hurricane.<sup id="_ref-tcr_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Irene entered the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> near <a href="/wiki/Jupiter%2C_Florida" id="w">Jupiter, Florida</a> early on <a href="/wiki/October_16" id="w">October 16</a>, still as a Category 1 hurricane. It turned to the north, remained a hurricane despite little convection, then turned to the northeast in response to an approaching upper-level <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">trough</a>. Just offshore, Irene moved parallel to the coastlines of <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina" id="w">South Carolina</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_17" id="w">October 17</a>. On <a href="/wiki/October_18" id="w">October 18</a>, as it interacted with very warm ocean waters and the upper level trough, Irene rapidly intensified, reaching peak winds of 110&#160;mph (175&#160;km/h) with a pressure of 952&#160;<a href="/wiki/Bar_(unit)" id="w">mbar</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 2</a> hurricane. Despite its strength, the circulation was very asymmetrical, and the convection was not particularly organized. The hurricane continued to accelerate to the northeast, steadily weakening until becoming extratropical on <a href="/wiki/October_19" id="w">October 19</a> to the south of <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)" id="w">Newfoundland</a>. The extratropical storm continued to the northeast until becoming absorbed by another, larger extratropical storm late that same day.<sup id="_ref-tcr_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Preparations" name="Preparations"></a><h2>Preparations</h2>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>, slightly over 228,000 residents were evacuated from low-lying areas before the storm. Around 10% stayed in temporary shelters, while the rest stayed with family or friends.<sup id="_ref-cubstuff_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cubstuff" title="">[4]</a></sup> Included in the evacuation total were 6,000 tourists<sup id="_ref-cnn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cnn" title="">[5]</a></sup> and over 1,000 residents in rickety houses. Workers protected tobacco leaves by moving them to sealed warehouses, and transported cattle and livestock to higher ground. The hurricane forced the closure of schools and the cancellation of some flights.<sup id="_ref-bbc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc" title="">[6]</a></sup> The Cuban government issued a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" id="w">Hurricane Watch</a> for <a href="/wiki/Pinar_del_R%C3%ADo_Province" id="w">Pinar del Río Province</a>, <a href="/wiki/Havana" id="w">Havana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Havana_Province" id="w">Havana Province</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Isla_de_la_Juventud" id="w">Isla de la Juventud</a> 21&#160;hours before Irene hit.

<p>Initially, forecasters predicted Irene to parallel the west coast of <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, weakening to a tropical storm before making landfall on the west-central portion of the state. However, when a more eastward track became evident,<sup id="_ref-srh_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-srh" title="">[7]</a></sup> officials in <a href="/wiki/Monroe_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Monroe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charlotte_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Charlotte</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lee_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Lee</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Manatee_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Manatee Counties</a> issued evacuation orders for people in mobile homes and recreational vehicles. In addition, <a href="/wiki/Key_West" id="w">Key West</a> issued a curfew during the storm&#39;s onslaught.<sup id="_ref-cnn_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cnn" title="">[5]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> issued a Hurricane Warning from <a href="/wiki/Florida_City%2C_Florida" id="w">Florida City</a> around the Florida Peninsula to <a href="/wiki/Boca_Grande%2C_Florida" id="w">Boca Grande</a>, including all of the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Keys" id="w">Florida Keys</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Dry_Tortugas" id="w">Dry Tortugas</a>.

<p>While moving northward off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, Irene was initially expected to make landfall along the <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina" id="w">South Carolina</a> coastline, prompting the National Hurricane Center to issue a Hurricane Warning from <a href="/wiki/Edisto_Beach%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Edisto Beach, South Carolina</a> to <a href="/wiki/Cape_Hatteras%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Cape Hatteras, North Carolina</a>. Because of this, voluntary evacuation orders were issued for portions of South Carolina. However, when the track shifted further to the east, mandatory evacuation orders were issued for coastal areas of North Carolina, with tens of thousands removed from their homes. The evacuation order included several beach towns; those living in low-lying areas and mobile homes were advised to seek shelter. In addition, many of those left homeless from <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Floyd" id="w">Hurricane Floyd</a>&#39;s passage just weeks before were evacuated to shelters. <a href="/wiki/Jim_Hunt" id="w">Jim Hunt</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_North_Carolina" id="w">Governor of North Carolina</a>, declared a state of emergency, with the state&#39;s emergency management team switching from a recovery objective towards a preparations mission.<sup id="_ref-bbc2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc2" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

Hurricane Irene dropped moderate rainfall ranging from 5 to 6&#160;inches (125 to 150&#160;mm) in eastern <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina" id="w">South Carolina</a>. The flooding closed several roads, including some in western <a href="/wiki/Georgetown_County%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Georgetown County</a> which were washed out.<sup id="_ref-scdam_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scdam" title="">[27]</a></sup> Moderate wind gusts of up to 48&#160;mph (77&#160;km/h) in <a href="/wiki/Charleston%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Charleston</a> downed trees and power lines, causing sporadic power outages. The winds also caused minor beach erosion along the coastline.<sup id="_ref-scdam2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scdam2" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>While paralleling the coast of <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a>, Irene produced heavy rainfall across the state, peaking at 11&#160;inches (280&#160;mm) in <a href="/wiki/Ernul%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Ernul</a> with several other locations reporting over 6&#160;inches (152&#160;mm).<sup id="_ref-tcr_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> The rainfall caused severe river flooding in North Carolina, many of which hadn&#39;t receded from <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Floyd" id="w">Hurricane Floyd</a>&#39;s passage less than a month earlier. Due to the <a href="/wiki/Surface_runoff" id="w">runoff</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Tar_River" id="w">Tar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cape_Fear_River" id="w">Cape Fear</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Neuse_River" id="w">Neuse Rivers</a> all crested above their banks. The flooding also caused a dam in south-central <a href="/wiki/Hoke_County%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Hoke County</a> to overflow.<sup id="_ref-newsreports_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newsreports" title="">[29]</a></sup> Irene spawned two tornadoes; an <a href="/wiki/Fujita_scale" id="w">F0</a> in <a href="/wiki/Jacksonville%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Jacksonville County</a><sup id="_ref-nctorn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nctorn" title="">[30]</a></sup> and an F2 in <a href="/wiki/Weeksville%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Weeksville</a>. The F2 destroyed 2 trailers, damaged several houses, and injured one person.<sup id="_ref-nctorn2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nctorn2" title="">[31]</a></sup> The heavy flooding closed several roads throughout North Carolina, causing several traffic accidents.<sup id="_ref-ncdam2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ncdam2" title="">[32]</a></sup> Hurricane Irene was indirectly responsible for one death when a man <a href="/wiki/Hydroplaning_(road_vehicle)" id="w">hydroplaned</a> on a wet road and crashed. Despite the severe flooding, Hurricane Irene caused little damage in North Carolina.<sup id="_ref-ncdam3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ncdam3" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hurricane Irene also produced heavy rainfall in southeastern <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a> of up to 12&#160;inches (305&#160;mm) in <a href="/wiki/Chesapeake%2C_Virginia" id="w">Chesapeake</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> The rainfall resulted in widespread street flooding, with some locations reporting flooding of up to 4&#160;feet (1.2&#160;m) deep.<sup id="_ref-vadam_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vadam" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Aftermath" name="Aftermath"></a><h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>Following the hurricane, the <a href="/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement" id="w">International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement</a> launched an emergency appeal for <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>. The appeal raised $217,498 (1999 <a href="/wiki/Swiss_franc" id="w">CHF</a>, $193,757 2006 USD) to supply hygiene items, household goods, water purification tablets, and water containers to the 12,000 living in temporary shelters. The appeal asked for repair supplies and to improve the response capacity of the national society for future disasters. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized over 4,500 volunteers to the effected areas to provide first aid to injured, distribute meals and medical supplies, and collaborate with blood banks.<sup id="_ref-cubstuff_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cubstuff" title="">[4]</a></sup> The government-controlled media broadcast system guaranteed repair items, though many people remained in damaged houses in the weeks after the storm.<sup id="_ref-morecub_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-morecub" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Just days after Irene moved through <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" id="w">Bill Clinton</a> declared 18&#160;counties as disaster areas. The declaration allowed effected businesses and homeowners to apply for federal assistance, such as money for temporary housing, minor home repairs, or disaster-related expenses. In addition, the president issued an emergency declaration for Florida, which released federal resources to aid in debris removal and emergency services.<sup id="_ref-declar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-declar" title="">[36]</a></sup> In addition, President Clinton declared the 66&#160;counties in <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> eligible for assistance due to <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Floyd" id="w">Hurricane Floyd</a> were also eligible for more assistance due to damage from Irene.<sup id="_ref-ncdecl_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ncdecl" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Bahamas" id="w">Bahamas</a>, township volunteers assisted in cleanup efforts. The Royal Bahamas Defence Force distributed hurricane relief supplies to those effected.<sup id="_ref-bahdam_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bahdam" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despte the damage, the <a href="/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization" id="w">World Meteorological Organization</a> did not retire the name <b>Irene</b> during its meeting in the following spring. As a result, it was <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Irene_(2005)" id="w">reused</a> in the <a href="/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, and is on the <a href="/wiki/Lists_of_tropical_cyclone_names#North Atlantic" id="w">list of names</a> to be used in 2011.</p>
