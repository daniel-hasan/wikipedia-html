<b><i>The Power of Nightmares</i></b>, subtitled <b><i>The Rise of the Politics of Fear</i></b>, is a <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a> <a href="/wiki/Documentary_film" id="w">documentary film</a> series, written and produced by <a href="/wiki/Adam_Curtis" id="w">Adam Curtis</a>. The series consists of three one-hour films, consisting mostly of a montage of archive footage with Curtis&#39;s narration, which were first broadcast in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> in late <a href="/wiki/2004_in_television" id="w">2004</a> and have been subsequently aired in multiple countries and shown in several film festivals, including the <a href="/wiki/2005_Cannes_Film_Festival" id="w">2005 Cannes Film Festival</a>.</p>
<p>The films compare the rise of the American <a href="/wiki/Neoconservatism" id="w">Neo-Conservative</a> movement and the <a href="/wiki/Islamist_terrorism" id="w">radical</a> <a href="/wiki/Islamism" id="w">Islamist</a> movement, making comparisons on their origins and noting strong similarities between the two. More controversially, it argues that the threat of radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organised force of destruction, specifically in the form of <a href="/wiki/Al-Qaeda" id="w">al-Qaeda</a>, is in fact a myth perpetrated by politicians in many countries—and particularly American Neo-Conservatives—in an attempt to unite and inspire their people following the failure of earlier, more <a href="/wiki/Utopian" id="w">utopian</a> ideologies.</p>
<p><i>The Power of Nightmares</i> has been praised by film critics in both <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">Britain</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. Its message and content have also been the subject of various critiques and criticisms from conservatives and progressives.</p>

<p>The first part of the series explains the origins of <a href="/wiki/Islamism" id="w">Islamism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neo-Conservatism" id="w">Neo-Conservatism</a>. It shows <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egyptian</a> civil servant <a href="/wiki/Sayyid_Qutb" id="w">Sayyid Qutb</a>, depicted as the founder of modern Islamist thought, visiting America to learn about the education system, but becoming disgusted with what he saw as a corruption of morals and virtues in western society through <a href="/wiki/Individualism" id="w">individualism</a>. When he returns to Egypt, he is disturbed by <a href="/wiki/Westernization" id="w">westernization</a> under <a href="/wiki/Gamal_Abdal_Nasser" id="w">President Nasser</a> and becomes convinced that in order to save society it must be completely restructured along the lines of <a href="/wiki/Sharia" id="w">Islamic law</a> while still using western technology. He also becomes convinced that this can only be accomplished through the use of an elite &#34;vanguard&#34; to lead a revolution against the established order. Qutb becomes a leader of the <a href="/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood" id="w">Muslim Brotherhood</a> and, after being tortured in one of Nasser&#39;s jails, comes to believe that western-influenced leaders can justly be killed for the sake of removing their corruption. Qutb is executed in 1966, but he inspires the future mentor of <a href="/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden" id="w">Osama bin Laden</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ayman_al-Zawahiri" id="w">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a>, to start his own secret Islamist group. Inspired by the <a href="/wiki/1979_Iranian_revolution" id="w">1979 Iranian revolution</a>, Zawahiri and his allies assassinate Egyptian president <a href="/wiki/Anwar_Al_Sadat" id="w">Anwar Al Sadat</a>, in <a href="/wiki/1981" id="w">1981</a>, in hopes of starting their own revolution. The revolution does not materialise, and Zawahiri comes to believe that the majority of Muslims have been corrupted by their western-inspired leaders and thus may be legitimate targets of violence if they do not join him.</p>
<p>At the same time in the United States, a group of disillusioned liberals, including <a href="/wiki/Irving_Kristol" id="w">Irving Kristol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paul_Wolfowitz" id="w">Paul Wolfowitz</a>, look to the political thinking of <a href="/wiki/Leo_Strauss" id="w">Leo Strauss</a> after the general failure of <a href="/wiki/Lyndon_Johnson" id="w">President Johnson&#39;s</a> &#34;<a href="/wiki/Great_Society" id="w">Great Society</a>&#34;. They come to the conclusion that the emphasis on individual liberty was the undoing of the plan. They envisioned restructuring America by uniting the American people against a common evil, and set about creating a mythical enemy. These factions, the Neo-Conservatives, come to power under the <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" id="w">Reagan</a> administration, with their allies <a href="/wiki/Dick_Cheney" id="w">Dick Cheney</a> and <a href="/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld" id="w">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, and work to unite the United States in fear of the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a>. The Neo-Conservatives allege the Soviet Union is not following the terms of disarmament between the two countries, and, with the investigation of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Team_B" id="w">Team B</a>&#34;, they accumulate a case to prove this with dubious evidence and methods. President Reagan is convinced nonetheless.<sup id="_ref-trans1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trans1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Part_2:_%22The_Phantom_Victory%22" name="Part_2:_%22The_Phantom_Victory%22"></a><h2>Part 2: &#34;The Phantom Victory&#34;</h2>
<p>In the second episode, Islamist factions, rapidly falling under the more radical influence of Zawahiri and his rich <a href="/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" id="w">Saudi</a> acolyte <a href="/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden" id="w">Osama bin Laden</a>, join the Neo-Conservative-influenced Reagan Administration to combat the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan" id="w">Soviet Union&#39;s invasion</a> of <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" id="w">Afghanistan</a>. They are successful in repulsing the Soviet armies and, when the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Bloc" id="w">Eastern Bloc</a> <a href="/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989" id="w">begins to collapse</a> in the late 1980s, both groups believe they were the primary architect of the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Evil_Empire" id="w">Evil Empire</a>&#39;s&#34; defeat and thus have the power to carry out their revolutions in their homelands. Curtis instead argues that the Soviets were on their last legs and were doomed to collapse without intervention.</p>
<p>Both factions&#39; revolutions end in failure. The Neo-Conservatives&#39; aspirations to use the United States Army&#39;s power for further destruction of evil are thrown off track by the ascent of <a href="/wiki/George_H._W._Bush" id="w">George H. W. Bush</a> to the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">American Presidency</a>, followed by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1992" id="w">1992 election</a> of <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" id="w">Bill Clinton</a> leaving them out of power. The Neo-Conservatives, with their <a href="/wiki/Christian_right" id="w">conservative Christian</a> allies, attempt to demonise Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, however, the American people do not acknowledge him as an enemy as they intended and remain indifferent to Clinton&#39;s alleged evils. The Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the sufficiently safe Afghanistan and declare a new strategy; to fight Western-inspired moral decay they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.<sup id="_ref-trans2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trans2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

The final episode addresses the actual rise of <a href="/wiki/Al-Qaeda" id="w">al-Qaeda</a>. Curtis argues that, after their failed revolutions, bin Laden and Zawahiri had little or no popular support, let alone a serious complex organisation of terrorists, and were dependent upon independent operatives to carry out their new call for <a href="/wiki/Jihad" id="w">jihad</a>. The film instead shows the United States government wanting to prosecute bin Laden <i><a href="/wiki/In_absentia" id="w">in absentia</a></i> for the <a href="/wiki/1998_U.S._embassy_bombings" id="w">1998 U.S. embassy bombings</a>, and needing to prove him to be the head of a criminal organisation to do so. They find a former associate of bin Laden, <a href="/wiki/Jamal_al-Fadl" id="w">Jamal al-Fadl</a>, and pay him to testify that bin Laden was the head of a massive terrorist organisation called &#34;al-Qaeda&#34;. With the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attack" id="w">September 11th attacks</a>, Neo-Conservatives in the new Republican government of <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">George W. Bush</a> use this created concept of an organisation to justify another crusade against a new evil enemy, leading to the launch of the <a href="/wiki/War_on_Terrorism" id="w">War on Terrorism</a>.</p>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)" id="w">American invasion of Afghanistan</a> fails to uproot the alleged terrorist network, the Neo-Conservatives focus inwards, searching unsuccessfully for terrorist <a href="/wiki/Sleeper_cell" id="w">sleeper cells</a> in America. They then extend the war on &#34;terror&#34; to a war against general perceived evils with the <a href="/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq" id="w">invasion of Iraq in 2003</a>. The ideas and tactics also spread to the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> where <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair" id="w">Tony Blair</a> uses the threat of terrorism to give him a new moral authority. The repercussions of the Neo-Conservative strategy are also explored with an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in <a href="/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp" id="w">Guantanamo Bay</a>, many allegedly taken on the word of the anti-<a href="/wiki/Taliban" id="w">Taliban</a> <a href="/wiki/United_Islamic_Front_for_the_Salvation_of_Afghanistan" id="w">Northern Alliance</a> without actual investigation on the part of the United States military, and other forms of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war" id="w">preemption</a>&#34; against non-existent and unlikely threats made simply on the grounds that the parties involved could later become a threat. Curtis also makes a specific attempt to defuse fears of a <a href="/wiki/Dirty_bomb" id="w">dirty bomb</a> attack, and concludes by reassuring viewers that politicians will eventually have to concede that some threats are exaggerated and others altogether devoid of reality.<sup id="_ref-trans3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trans3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Adam Curtis originally intended to create a film about conflict within the <a href="/wiki/Conservative" id="w">conservative</a> movement between the ideologies of Neo-Conservative &#34;elitism&#34; and more individualist <a href="/wiki/Libertarian" id="w">libertarian</a> factions. During his research into the conservative movement, however, Curtis first saw similarities in the origins of the Neo-Conservative and Islamist ideologies. The topic of the planned documentary shifted to these latter two ideologies while the libertarian element was eventually phased out.<sup id="_ref-cinescope_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cinescope" title="">[4]</a></sup> Curtis first pitched the idea of a documentary on conservative ideology in <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a> and spent six months compiling the films.<sup id="_ref-exorcist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-exorcist" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-guardcanned_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardcanned" title="">[6]</a></sup> The final recordings for the three parts were made on <a href="/wiki/October_10" id="w">October 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/October_19" id="w">October 19</a> and <a href="/wiki/November_1" id="w">November 1</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>.<sup id="_ref-cata1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cata1" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-cata2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cata2" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-cata3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cata3" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Criticisms" name="Criticisms"></a><h2>Criticisms</h2>
<p>Several critics in the United States slammed <i>The Power of Nightmares</i> as <a href="/wiki/Anti-American" id="w">anti-American</a>. <a href="/wiki/David_Asman" id="w">David Asman</a> noted on the film on <i><a href="/wiki/FoxNews.com" id="w">FoxNews.com</a></i> that &#34;We wish we didn&#39;t have to keep presenting examples of how the European media have become obsessively anti-American. But they keep pushing the barrier, now to the point of absurdity.&#34;<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> His views were shared by Clive Davis, concluding his commentary on the film for conservative bi-weekly magazine <i><a href="/wiki/The_National_Review" id="w">The National Review</a></i> with &#34;British producers, hooked on <a href="/wiki/Noam_Chomsky" id="w">Chomskyite</a> visions of &#39;Amerika&#39; as the fount of all evil, are clearly not interested in even beginning to dig for the truth.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Davis_NRO_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davis_NRO" title="">[41]</a></sup> An article on <a href="/wiki/Christian_Broadcasting_Network" id="w">CBN.com</a> linked the film to an alleged Islamist-<a href="/wiki/Liberal" id="w">liberal</a> alliance formed by &#34;hatred of America, <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" id="w">capitalism</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israel</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-cbn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cbn" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other observers variously described the films as pushing a <a href="/wiki/Conspiracy_theory" id="w">conspiracy theory</a> or being generally out of touch with reality. Davis and British commentator <a href="/wiki/David_Aaronovitch" id="w">David Aaronovitch</a> both explicitly labeled the film&#39;s message as a conspiracy theory, with the latter saying of Curtis &#34;his argument is as subtle as a house-brick.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Davis_NRO_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davis_NRO" title="">[41]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> Attacks in this vein continued after the <a href="/wiki/7_July_2005_London_bombings" id="w">7 July 2005 London bombings</a>, with CBN referencing the film as a source for claims by the &#34;British left&#34; that &#34;the U.S. War on Terror was a fraud&#34; and the <a href="/wiki/AIJAC" id="w">Australia Israel &#38; Jewish Affairs Council</a> calling it &#34;the loopiest, most extreme antiwar documentary series ever sponsored by the BBC.&#34;<sup id="_ref-AIJAC_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AIJAC" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-cbn_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cbn" title="">[42]</a></sup> In <i>The Shadows in the Cave</i>, Curtis took the time to stress that he did not discount the possibility of any terrorist activity taking place.<sup id="_ref-trans3_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trans3" title="">[3]</a></sup> He responded to accusations of creating a conspiracy theory that he believes that the alleged use of fear as a force in politics is not the result of a conspiracy but rather the subjects of the film &#34;have stumbled on it&#34;.<sup id="_ref-awakened_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-awakened" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Peter_Bergen" id="w">Peter Bergen</a>, writing for the left wing magazine <i>The Nation</i>, offered a detailed critique of the film. Bergen wrote that even if <a href="/wiki/Al-Qaeda" id="w">al-Qaeda</a> is not as organised as the Bush Administration stresses, it is still a very dangerous force due to the fanaticism of its followers and the resources available to bin Laden. His own comment on Curtis&#39;s claim that al-Qaeda was legally invented by the Americans is &#34;This is nonsense. There is substantial evidence that Al Qaeda was founded in <a href="/wiki/1988" id="w">1988</a> by bin Laden and a small group of like-minded militants, and that the group would mushroom into the secretive, disciplined organisation that implemented the 9/11 attacks.&#34;<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> Bergen further claimed that, in fact, Curtis&#39;s arguments serve as a defence of Bush&#39;s failure to capture bin Laden in the <a href="/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)" id="w">2001 invasion of Afghanistan</a> and his ignoring warnings of a terror attack prior to September 11th.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>Additional issues have been raised over Curtis&#39;s depiction of the Neo-Conservatives. Davis&#39;s article in the National Review showed him displeased with Curtis&#39;s depiction of Leo Strauss, claiming &#34;In Curtis&#39;s world, it is Strauss, not Osama bin Laden, who is the real evil genius.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Davis_NRO_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davis_NRO" title="">[41]</a></sup> Peter Bergen claimed the film exaggerated the influence of Strauss over Neo-Conservatism, crediting the political philosophy more to <a href="/wiki/Albert_Wohlstetter" id="w">Albert Wohlstetter</a>.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> A 2005 review on <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Null" id="w">Christopher Null</a>&#39;s Filmcritic.com took issue with <i>The Phantom Victory</i> &#39;s retelling of the attacks on Bill Clinton, crediting these more to the American Religious Right than the &#34;bookish university types&#34; of the Neo-Conservative movement.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are also allegations of omissions in the history described by the film. The absence of discussion of the <a href="/wiki/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict" id="w">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> was noticed by observers.<sup id="_ref-NYT_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-village_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-village" title="">[35]</a></sup> Davis claimed that Leo Strauss&#39;s ideas had been formed by experiences <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Weimar_Republic" id="w">Weimar Republic</a> and alleged the film&#39;s failure to mention this was motivated by a wish to display Strauss as concerned with American <a href="/wiki/Suburban" id="w">suburban</a> culture, like Qutb.<sup id="_ref-Davis_NRO_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davis_NRO" title="">[41]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/MediaLens" id="w">MediaLens</a> criticised the film for failing to explore the role of big business in the situation it described.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Comparisons_to_''Fahrenheit_9/11''" name="Comparisons_to_''Fahrenheit_9/11''"></a><h2>Comparisons to &#39;&#39;Fahrenheit 9/11&#39;&#39;</h2>
<p>After its release, <i>The Power of Nightmares</i> received multiple comparisons to <i><a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit_9/11" id="w">Fahrenheit 9/11</a></i>, American filmmaker <a href="/wiki/Michael_Moore" id="w">Michael Moore</a>&#39;s 2004 critique on the <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush%26%2339%3Bs_first_term_as_President_of_the_United_States" id="w">first four years</a> of George W.
