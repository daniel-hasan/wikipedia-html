<b>Arsenal Stadium</b> was a <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">football</a> stadium in <a href="/wiki/Highbury" id="w">Highbury</a>, <a href="/wiki/North_London" id="w">North London</a>, which was the home ground of <a href="/wiki/Arsenal_F.C." id="w">Arsenal Football Club</a> between <a href="/wiki/6_September" id="w">6 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1913" id="w">1913</a> and <a href="/wiki/7_May" id="w">7 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>. It was popularly known as <b>Highbury</b> due to its location, and was given the affectionate and unofficial nickname of &#34;The Home of Football&#34; by the club.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was originally built in 1913 on the site of a local <a href="/wiki/College" id="w">college</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Recreation_ground" id="w">recreation ground</a> and has been significantly redeveloped twice. The first came in the 1930s from which the still-existing <a href="/wiki/Art_Deco" id="w">Art Deco</a> East and West Stands date; the second in the late 1980s and early 1990s following the <a href="/wiki/Taylor_Report" id="w">Taylor Report</a>, during which the <a href="/wiki/Terrace_(stadium)" id="w">terraces</a> at both ends of the pitch were removed, making it all-seater with four stands. The resulting reduction in capacity and matchday revenue eventually led to Arsenal deciding to build the <a href="/wiki/Emirates_Stadium" id="w">Emirates Stadium</a> nearby, which they moved to in 2006. Currently, Highbury is undergoing redevelopment to turn it into an <a href="/wiki/Apartment_complex" id="w">apartment complex</a>, with most of the stadium being demolished; parts of the East and West Stands will remain to be incorporated into the new development.</p>
<p>The stadium also hosted <a href="/wiki/England_national_football_team" id="w">England</a> matches and <a href="/wiki/FA_Cup" id="w">FA Cup</a> <a href="/wiki/Semi-finals" id="w">semi-finals</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Boxing" id="w">boxing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Baseball" id="w">baseball</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">cricket</a>. Its presence also led to the local <a href="/wiki/London_Underground" id="w">Tube</a> station being renamed to &#34;<a href="/wiki/Arsenal_tube_station" id="w">Arsenal</a>&#34; in 1932, making it the only station on the network to be named after a football club.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>

<p>The original stadium was built in 1913, when Woolwich Arsenal moved from the <a href="/wiki/Manor_Ground%2C_Plumstead" id="w">Manor Ground</a> in <a href="/wiki/Plumstead" id="w">Plumstead</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_East_London" id="w">South East London</a> to Highbury, leasing the recreation fields of St John&#39;s College of Divinity for £20,000. The stadium was hurriedly built over the summer of that year, and was designed by <a href="/wiki/Archibald_Leitch" id="w">Archibald Leitch</a>, architect of many other football grounds of that era; it featured a single stand on the eastern side, and the other three sides had banked terracing. The new stadium cost £125,000. It opened whilst not yet fully complete, with Arsenal&#39;s first match of the <a href="/wiki/1913-14_in_English_football" id="w">1913-14</a> season, a 2-1 <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Second_Division" id="w">Second Division</a> win against <a href="/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C." id="w">Leicester Fosse</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_6" id="w">September 6</a> 1913; Leicester&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Benfield" id="w">Tommy Benfield</a> scored the first goal at the new ground, while <a href="/wiki/George_Jobey" id="w">George Jobey</a> was the first Arsenal player to do so.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Highbury hosted its first England match in 1920. Arsenal bought the stadium site outright in 1925, for £64,000.</p>
<p>No significant portion of Leitch&#39;s original stadium remains today, following a series of bold redevelopments during the <a href="/wiki/1930s" id="w">1930s</a>. The first of these was the West Stand, designed by <a href="/wiki/Claude_Ferrier" id="w">Claude Waterlow Ferrier</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Binnie" id="w">William Binnie</a> in the Art Deco style, which opened in <a href="/wiki/1932" id="w">1932</a>;<sup id="_ref-ConservationPlan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ConservationPlan" title="">[3]</a></sup> the same year, on <a href="/wiki/November_5" id="w">November 5</a>, the local Tube station was renamed from &#34;&#34;Gillespie Road&#34; to &#34;Arsenal&#34;. Leitch&#39;s main stand was demolished to make way for a new East Stand, matching the West, in <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a>. The West Stand cost £45,000 while the East Stand went far over budget and ended up costing £130,000, mainly thanks to the expense of the facade.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  The North Bank terrace was given a roof, and the southern terrace had a <a href="/wiki/Clock" id="w">clock</a> fitted to its front, giving it the name &#34;The Clock End.&#34;</p>
<p>For the next 50 years, the stadium changed little, although during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> the North Bank terrace was bombed and had to be rebuilt; the roof was not restored until 1956. <a href="/wiki/Floodlight" id="w">Floodlights</a> were fitted in 1951, with the first floodlit match being a friendly against <a href="/wiki/Hapoel_Tel_Aviv_FC" id="w">Hapoel Tel Aviv</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_17" id="w">October 17</a> of that year. <a href="/wiki/Undersoil_heating" id="w">Undersoil heating</a> was added in 1964. Unlike at many other grounds, Arsenal refused to install <a href="/wiki/Fence" id="w">perimeter fencing</a>, even at the height of <a href="/wiki/Football_hooliganism" id="w">hooliganism</a> in the 1980s, a decision that saw it struck off the list of eligible FA Cup semi-final venues.<sup id="_ref-feverpitch_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-feverpitch" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the <a href="/wiki/Taylor_report" id="w">Taylor report</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster" id="w">Hillsborough disaster</a> was published, which recommended that football stadiums become all-seater. The North Bank, which had become home of Arsenal&#39;s most passionate supporters, was demolished in 1992, and a new all-seater stand opened in its place the following year. During the work, a giant mural of fans was placed behind the goal at that end, to give the illusion that the players were kicking towards a crowd rather than a construction site. The mural initially attracted criticism for its absence of black fans, which was quickly rectified.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> The Clock End was also redeveloped, with a roof and executive boxes fitted in 1989, and seating installed four years later.</p>
<a id="Structure" name="Structure"></a><h2>Structure</h2>

<p>At the time of its closure, the stadium consisted of four separate all-seater stands; the pitch was aligned north-south, with the North Bank Stand and South Stand (popularly known as the Clock End) at the ends. The East and West Stands ran alongside the pitch, and are two of the few examples of British football stands designed in the Art Deco style. The East Stand incorporated the club&#39;s offices and was well known for its <a href="/wiki/Marble" id="w">marble</a> halls (though the floors were actually <a href="/wiki/Terrazzo" id="w">terrazzo</a>) which are often cited in media depictions of the stadium,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> and the <a href="/wiki/Facade" id="w">facade</a> that faces onto Avenell Road. The stand is considered architecturally significant enough to have been designated a <a href="/wiki/Listed_building" id="w">Grade II listed building</a>.<sup id="_ref-ConservationPlan_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ConservationPlan" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The stadium&#39;s main entrances were on <a href="/wiki/Gillespie_Road" id="w">Gillespie Road</a>, <a href="/wiki/Avenell_Road" id="w">Avenell Road</a> and <a href="/wiki/Highbury_Hill" id="w">Highbury Hill</a>. When it closed, Highbury had a capacity of 38,419<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> (approximately 12,500 in the North Bank, 11,000 in the West Stand, 9,000 in the East Stand and 6,000 in the Clock End), all seated, and had <a href="/wiki/Jumbotron" id="w">Jumbotron</a> screens in the south-east and north-west corners. Before the Taylor Report and the era of all-seater stadiums in Britain, both the North Bank and Clock End consisted of <a href="/wiki/Terrace_(stadium)" id="w">terracing</a>, and the stadium often saw crowds of up to 60,000 or more; its largest attendance was 73,295 on <a href="/wiki/March_9" id="w">March 9</a> <a href="/wiki/1935" id="w">1935</a> when Arsenal played <a href="/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C." id="w">Sunderland</a>; the game finished 0–0.</p>
<p>Arsenal Stadium was well known for its very small immaculately-kept <a href="/wiki/Football_pitch" id="w">pitch</a>, which measured only 109×73 <a href="/wiki/Yard" id="w">yards</a> (100×67 <a href="/wiki/Metre" id="w">metres</a>).<sup id="_ref-QuestionsAndAnswers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-QuestionsAndAnswers" title="">[9]</a></sup> Arsenal&#39;s groundsmen, Steve Braddock and his successor Paul Burgess, have won the <a href="/wiki/FA_Premier_League" id="w">FA Premier League</a>&#39;s Groundsman of the Year award several times.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>The post-Taylor capacity of Highbury was limited to 38,419, while Arsenal&#39;s success during the 1990s and 2000s meant that virtually every home match was filled to near total capacity. However, restrictions such as the East Stand&#39;s status as a listed building made any future expansion of Highbury difficult and expensive. Eventually, Arsenal decided to leave Highbury, and construct a new stadium, the Emirates Stadium in nearby Ashburton Grove, which opened in July 2006. For their final season at Highbury (<a href="/wiki/2005-06_in_English_football" id="w">2005-06</a>), Arsenal ran a series of promotions honouring the stadium&#39;s legacy. A commemorative logo was designed, featuring the club&#39;s traditional Art Deco crest from the 1930s; the club&#39;s history at Highbury was also celebrated through a series of themed matchdays. On the field, Arsenal temporarily set aside their traditional red shirts with white sleeves for the season and adopted a solid redcurrant shirt, the colour they wore during their first season at Highbury in 1913-14.</p>
<p>Arsenal&#39;s final game at the stadium was their FA Premier League match on <a href="/wiki/7_May" id="w">7 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> against 
<a href="/wiki/Wigan_Athletic_F.C." id="w">Wigan Athletic</a>, which they won 4-2, with their captain and all-time leading goal scorer, <a href="/wiki/Thierry_Henry" id="w">Thierry Henry</a>, getting a <a href="/wiki/Hat_trick" id="w">hat trick</a>. After the stadium&#39;s closure, Arsenal held an <a href="/wiki/Auction" id="w">auction</a> to sell off many of the stadium&#39;s parts, including pieces of the pitch, the <a href="/wiki/Goal_(sport)" id="w">goalposts</a> and former manager <a href="/wiki/George_Graham_(footballer)" id="w">George Graham</a>&#39;s desk;<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> sale of the stadium&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Seat" id="w">seats</a> had to be cancelled, however, after it was found they contained trace amounts of the toxic metal <a href="/wiki/Cadmium" id="w">cadmium</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Arsenal Stadium is currently (as of 2007) being redeveloped and converted into <a href="/wiki/Apartment" id="w">apartments</a>, in a project known as &#34;Highbury Square&#34;, a scheme that will see 711 properties built on the site. The North Bank and Clock End stands have already been demolished, with the famous clock having been moved to the new stadium; the exteriors of the listed Art Deco East Stand and the matching West Stand are being preserved and incorporated into the new developments, while the rest of the stands&#39; structures have been removed. The pitch will become a communal <a href="/wiki/Garden" id="w">garden</a>. In October 2005 the proposed apartments went on sale; as of May 2006 all properties in the North, East and West Stands had been taken. The apartments are expected to be ready by 2010.</p>

<p>As well as being home to Arsenal, Highbury occasionally functioned as a home stadium for England matches; 12 internationals were played at Highbury from 1920 to 1961, most of them being friendlies. These included both England&#39;s first full home international against opposition outside of <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">Great Britain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a> (<a href="/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team" id="w">Belgium</a> in 1923), and the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Highbury" id="w">Battle of Highbury</a>&#34;, England&#39;s famous 3-2 win over <a href="/wiki/Football_World_Cup" id="w">World Champions</a> <a href="/wiki/Italy_national_football_team" id="w">Italy</a> in 1932, where seven Arsenal players started the match. Highbury was also used as a football venue for two matches in the <a href="/wiki/1948_Summer_Olympic_Games" id="w">1948 London Olympics</a> (a first-round match and a quarter-final<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>), although it did not host any games in the <a href="/wiki/1966_FIFA_World_Cup" id="w">1966 FIFA World Cup</a> or <a href="/wiki/1996_UEFA_European_Football_Championship" id="w">Euro 96</a>, both of which were held in England; by the time of the latter, the pitch had been ruled too small for international football.</p>
<p>Highbury was the venue for twelve FA Cup semi-finals as a neutral ground, the first in 1929 and the last in 1997, although between 1984 and 1992 it was off the FA&#39;s list of approved venues, after Arsenal&#39;s refusal to install perimeter fencing following a <a href="/wiki/Pitch_invasion" id="w">pitch invasion</a> by <a href="/wiki/Everton_F.C." id="w">Everton</a> fans during their semi-final against <a href="/wiki/Southampton_F.C." id="w">Southampton</a>.<sup id="_ref-feverpitch_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-feverpitch" title="">[5]</a></sup> It also hosted the <a href="/wiki/London_XI" id="w">London XI</a>&#39;s home leg against <a href="/wiki/Lausanne_Sports" id="w">Lausanne Sports</a> in the <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Inter-Cities_Fairs_Cup_1955-58" id="w">1955-58</a> <a href="/wiki/Inter-Cities_Fairs_Cup" id="w">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> semi-finals; London won 2-0 on the night and 3-2 on aggregate.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Leyton_Orient_F.C." id="w">Clapton Orient</a> also played a single home game at Highbury in 1930 while their own ground, <a href="/wiki/Lea_Bridge_Road" id="w">Lea Bridge Road</a>, underwent development work to meet League standards.</p>
<p>Arsenal did not always play their home matches at Highbury in the 93 years they were based there. During the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a> the stadium was used as an <a href="/wiki/Air_Raid_Precautions" id="w">ARP</a> station and was <a href="/wiki/Bomb" id="w">bombed</a>; Arsenal played their matches at <a href="/wiki/White_Hart_Lane" id="w">White Hart Lane</a>, home of deadly rivals <a href="/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C." id="w">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, until Highbury re-opened in 1946. More recently, Arsenal&#39;s home <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League" id="w">UEFA Champions League</a> matches in the <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League_1998-99" id="w">1998-99</a> and <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League_1999-00" id="w">1999-00</a> seasons were played at <a href="/wiki/Wembley_Stadium_(1924)" id="w">Wembley Stadium</a>, as Highbury&#39;s already limited capacity had to be reduced to accommodate <a href="/wiki/Advertising" id="w">advertising</a> <a href="/wiki/Billboard_(advertising)" id="w">hoardings</a>. Arsenal&#39;s record at Wembley (P6 W2 D1 L3) was relatively poor, and after two seasons the club switched back to playing at Highbury, not least because since Wembley closed for rebuilding in October 2000, it would not have been able to host their <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League_2000-01" id="w">2000-01</a> campaign.</p>
<p>Highbury has also hosted several cricket and baseball matches, and was the venue for the 1966 World Heavyweight boxing title bout between <a href="/wiki/Henry_Cooper_(boxer)" id="w">Henry Cooper</a> and <a href="/wiki/Muhammad_Ali" id="w">Muhammad Ali</a>, which Ali won. It has featured on the silver screen as well, having been the backdrop to at least two movies: <i><a href="/wiki/The_Arsenal_Stadium_Mystery" id="w">The Arsenal Stadium Mystery</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Fever_Pitch" id="w">Fever Pitch</a></i>.</p>
