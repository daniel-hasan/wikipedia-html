<p>&#34;<b>Lisa the Skeptic</b>&#34; is the eighth episode of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons" id="w">The Simpsons</a></i>&#39; <a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons_(season_9)" id="w">ninth season</a>, first aired on <a href="/wiki/November_23" id="w">November 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>.  On an <a href="/wiki/Archaeology" id="w">archaeological</a> dig with her class, Lisa discovers a skeleton that resembles an angel.  All of the townspeople believe that the skeleton actually came from an angel, but <a href="/wiki/Skepticism" id="w">skeptical</a> Lisa attempts to persuade them that there must be a <a href="/wiki/Rational_skepticism" id="w">rational scientific</a> explanation.  The skeleton is later revealed to be a <a href="/wiki/Publicity_stunt" id="w">publicity stunt</a> for a new mall going up in Springfield, and the townspeople forget their concerns about the skeleton to go shopping.  </p>
<p>Writer <a href="/wiki/David_S._Cohen" id="w">David S. Cohen</a> had the inspiration for the episode after visiting the <a href="/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History" id="w">American Museum of Natural History</a>, and decided to loosely parallel themes from the <a href="/wiki/Scopes_Trial" id="w">Scopes Monkey Trial</a>.  The episode has been discussed in the context of concepts involving <a href="/wiki/Virtual_reality" id="w">virtual reality</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ontology" id="w">ontology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Existentialism" id="w">existentialism</a>, and skepticism.  The episode received mixed reviews, but has since been used in Christian religious education classes to form a discussion around angels, skepticism, and the balance between science and faith.</p>
<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h1> Plot </h1>
<p>As <a href="/wiki/Homer_Simpson" id="w">Homer</a> attempts to get a <a href="/wiki/Motorboat" id="w">motorboat</a>, a new <a href="/wiki/Shopping_mall" id="w">shopping mall</a> in <a href="/wiki/Springfield_(The_Simpsons)" id="w">Springfield</a> is being built on an area where a large number of <a href="/wiki/Fossil" id="w">fossils</a> were found. <a href="/wiki/Lisa_Simpson" id="w">Lisa</a> condemns and protests the building of the mall. Thanks to her protest, it prompts the school to conduct an archaeological dig. During the excavations, Lisa finds a human skeleton with wings. Springfield&#39;s residents are convinced it is an <a href="/wiki/Angel" id="w">angel</a>, and Homer cashes in by moving the skeleton into the family&#39;s garage. Lisa remains skeptical and&#8212;believing it may not actually be an angel&#8212;has <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould" id="w">Stephen Jay Gould</a> test a sample. When Dr. Gould appears at the Simpson house the next day to tell Lisa that the tests were inconclusive, Lisa goes on television to compare the belief in angels to the belief in <a href="/wiki/Unicorn" id="w">unicorns</a> and <a href="/wiki/Leprechaun" id="w">leprechauns</a>. In response, Springfield&#39;s religious zealots go on a rampage to destroy all scientific institutions (including, in a side joke, the destruction of a <a href="/wiki/Christian_Science" id="w">Christian Science</a> library). Appalled by the violence, Lisa goes into the garage to destroy the skeleton, only to find that it has disappeared. The mob soon converges on the Simpson household, and Lisa is promptly arrested and put on trial for stealing the skeleton.  However, before the trial can proceed, the courtroom&#39;s attention is diverted when the skeleton appears outside.</p>
<p>When the skeleton reappears, it carries a foreboding message that &#34;<a href="/wiki/Apocalypse" id="w">The End</a>&#34; will come at sundown. Meanwhile, Judge Snyder issues a <a href="/wiki/Injunction" id="w">restraining order</a> to keep science and religion 500&#160;yards apart at all times. Sundown approaches, and Springfield&#39;s citizens are frightened, but nothing catastrophic occurs. Lisa gets prepared to tell off everyone and when she begins, the skeleton suddenly yells &#34;Prepare for the end... the end of high prices!&#34; and is hoisted over to the entrance of a new discount shopping mall. Lisa realizes that the &#34;end is near&#34; saga was actually a <a href="/wiki/Publicity_stunt" id="w">publicity stunt</a> for the mall as a way to exploit the deepest beliefs of people, and calls for a <a href="/wiki/Boycott" id="w">boycott</a> of the mall. She fails, and the bargain-hunting public go shopping anyway. Dr. Gould subsequently confesses that he did not actually do any testing. In the end Marge points out to Lisa that, despite all her skepticism, for a few seconds while the Angel was rising Lisa really did believe the Angel was real. Lisa denies this, but thanks her mother for her support in her moment of weakness.<sup id="_ref-officialsite_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialsite" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-parvin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-parvin" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-irwin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-irwin" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-turner_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-turner" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-brown_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brown" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-booker_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-booker" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
