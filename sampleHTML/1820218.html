<p>The game focuses on a young man named Wander who must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen <a href="/wiki/Giant_(mythology)" id="w">giants</a>, beings collectively known as colossi, to restore the life of a girl. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or <a href="/wiki/Dungeon_(games)" id="w">dungeons</a> to explore, no characters with which to interact, and no enemies to defeat, other than the colossi.<sup id="_ref-colossalcreation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colossalcreation" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-behindtheshadow_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-behindtheshadow" title="">[5]</a></sup> <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> has been described as a <a href="/wiki/Computer_puzzle_game" id="w">puzzle</a> game, as each colossus&#39; weakness must be identified and exploited before it can be defeated.<sup id="_ref-gamespotreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespotreview" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-eurogamer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eurogamer" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Basics" name="Basics"></a><h2>Basics</h2>
<p>Progression through <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> occurs in cycles. Beginning at a central point in an expansive landscape, the player seeks out and defeats a colossus, and is then returned to the central point to repeat the process.<sup id="_ref-gamespotreview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespotreview" title="">[6]</a></sup> To find each colossus, Wander must raise his <a href="/wiki/Sword" id="w">sword</a> while in a sunlit area to reflect beams of light, which will converge when the sword is pointed in the right direction of the next encounter.<sup id="_ref-ignpreview2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignpreview2" title="">[8]</a></sup> The journey to a colossus is seldom a straightforward matter—stretches of varied terrain often require that a detour be taken along the way. Most colossi are located in remote areas, such as atop cliffs or within ancient structures, and tend to be located progressively farther away from the central area.</p>
<p>Once a colossus is found, the player must discover its weaknesses to defeat it. Each colossus dwells in a unique lair, and many colossi cannot be defeated without making use of the surrounding environment.<sup id="_ref-ignpreview3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignpreview3" title="">[9]</a></sup> Every colossus has at least one weak point, indicated by a glowing <a href="/wiki/Sigil_(magic)" id="w">sigil</a>.<sup id="_ref-giantleap_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-giantleap" title="">[10]</a></sup> If the area is lit by sunlight, the player may use the sword&#39;s reflected light to temporarily illuminate these sigils.<sup id="_ref-ignpreview2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignpreview2" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ignpreview4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignpreview4" title="">[11]</a></sup> Each colossus has areas covered with <a href="/wiki/Fur" id="w">fur</a> or protruding ledges, which the player may use to grip and scale the colossus while it thrashes about in an attempt to dislodge the player.<sup id="_ref-gamespotreview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespotreview" title="">[6]</a></sup> While scaling a colossus, the player must act quickly, as Wander has a limited grip gauge that decreases while he hangs onto the creature.</p>

Wander and the colossi have <a href="/wiki/Health_(game_mechanism)" id="w">life bars</a> to indicate their remaining health. The colossi&#39;s health will decrease significantly when their weak points are attacked, while Wander can be harmed by a colossus&#39; attacks or falls from great heights. Throughout the game, Wander is equipped with only a sword and a <a href="/wiki/Bow_(weapon)" id="w">bow</a><sup id="_ref-giantleap_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-giantleap" title="">[10]</a></sup> , although different items can be obtained by completing Time Attack mode.</p>
<a id="Agro_and_the_environment" name="Agro_and_the_environment"></a><h2>Agro and the environment</h2>
<p>Wander&#39;s horse, Agro, plays a large role in the game. In addition to serving as a means of transportation, Agro is vital in defeating some of the Colossi.<sup id="_ref-ignpreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignpreview" title="">[12]</a></sup> There are, however, many places that Agro cannot reach. Colossi often inhabit areas beyond deep water or obstacles that must be scaled. Agro cannot travel beyond these, and when separated from Wander by such obstacles, cannot participate in the following battle.<sup id="_ref-ignpreview2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignpreview2" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The environment must be used to the player&#39;s advantage more often as the game progresses. The first two battles take place on simple, large, flat areas of land, with the only goal being to discover how to scale the colossi and attack their weak points.<sup id="_ref-ignpreview2_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignpreview2" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ignpreview3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignpreview3" title="">[9]</a></sup> However, the majority of the following fourteen battles require that some aspect of the battlefield be used.<sup id="_ref-eurogamer_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eurogamer" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ignreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignreview" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>During <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i>, the player receives little information concerning the backstories of the characters and their relationships with one another.<sup id="_ref-gamespotreview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespotreview" title="">[6]</a></sup> The game clearly takes place in a <a href="/wiki/Fantasy" id="w">fantasy</a> setting,<sup id="_ref-gamespyreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespyreview" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-fantasysetting_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fantasysetting" title="">[15]</a></sup> with most of the game&#39;s events occurring within a vast and unpopulated <a href="/wiki/Peninsula" id="w">peninsula</a> separated from the outside world by a mountain range to its North and sea to the South and East. The presence of ruins and other ancient structures indicate that the area was once a settlement.<sup id="_ref-ignreview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignreview" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ruins_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ruins" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-newyorkmagazine_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newyorkmagazine" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ruins2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ruins2" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The region is only accessible via a small cleft in the mountains to the north, leading to a massive stone bridge. This bridge spans half the distance of the landscape and terminates at a large temple called the &#34;Shrine of Worship&#34; located at its center. It is, however, forbidden to enter the land,<sup id="_ref-dorminandshrine_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dorminandshrine" title="">[19]</a></sup> which is characterized by diverse geographical features, such as <a href="/wiki/Lake" id="w">lakes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Desert" id="w">deserts</a>, in addition to man-made structures.<sup id="_ref-gamespotreview_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespotreview" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ignreview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignreview" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

The <a href="/wiki/Protagonist" id="w">protagonist</a> of the game is Wander (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Kenji_Nojima" id="w">Kenji Nojima</a>), a young man whose goal is to <a href="/wiki/Resurrection" id="w">resurrect</a> a girl named &#34;Mono&#34; (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Hitomi_Nabatame" id="w">Hitomi Nabatame</a>). Little is known about Mono other than that she was somehow <a href="/wiki/Human_sacrifice" id="w">sacrificed</a> because she was believed to have a cursed destiny.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Assisting Wander in his quest to revive her is his loyal horse, Agro, who serves as his only ally in defeating the colossi.<sup id="_ref-official site_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-official site" title="">[21]</a></sup> The story revolves around these three characters, but features a small supporting cast including Dormin (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Kazuhiro_Nakata" id="w">Kazuhiro Nakata</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kyoko_Hikami" id="w">Kyoko Hikami</a>) and Lord Emon (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Naoki_Bando" id="w">Naoki Bando</a>).</p>
<p>Referring to itself in the <a href="/wiki/Plural" id="w">plural</a> and speaking with two voices at once (one male and one female), Dormin is a mysterious, disembodied entity consisting of several beings that reside in the Shrine of Worship.<sup id="_ref-official site_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-official site" title="">[21]</a></sup> Its physical form was severed into sixteen components many years before the beginning of the game, and became sealed within the colossi for unexplained reasons.<sup id="_ref-dorminsealed_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dorminsealed" title="">[22]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/Legend" id="w">legends</a> of the game&#39;s world, it is said that Dormin has the power to revive the dead,<sup id="_ref-dorminandshrine_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dorminandshrine" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-official site_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-official site" title="">[21]</a></sup> and it is for this reason that Wander enters the forbidden land, seeking its assistance in reviving Mono. Dormin offers to revive her in exchange for Wander destroying the sixteen colossi.<sup id="_ref-dorminrequest_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dorminrequest" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lord Emon is a <a href="/wiki/Shamanism" id="w">shaman</a> who narrates a vision in the game&#39;s introduction, vaguely explaining the origin of the land Wander has come to, and emphasising that entry to this place is forbidden.<sup id="_ref-dorminandshrine_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dorminandshrine" title="">[19]</a></sup> He is portrayed as having extensive knowledge regarding the containment of Dormin, and the ability to use powerful <a href="/wiki/Magic_(paranormal)" id="w">magic</a>. He has a small group of soldiers at his command, and is pursuing Wander to prevent the use of &#34;the forbidden spell&#34;, the ritual involving the destruction of the sixteen colossi.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>The colossi are armored, most often enormous creatures with forms ranging from various humanoids to predatory animals. Their bodies are a fusion of rock, earth, fur, and architectural elements (some parts weathered or fractured). When trespassing upon their territory, the player is ignored by some colossi, while others will attack on sight.<sup id="_ref-gamespotreview_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespotreview" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-pressstart_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pressstart" title="">[25]</a></sup> Inhabiting specific locations in the forbidden land, they do not venture outside their own territory.

<a id="Story" name="Story"></a><h2>Story</h2>
<p>The story of <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> begins as Wander enters the forbidden land, traveling across the long bridge at its entrance on his horse, Agro. Led to the massive Shrine of Worship at the center of the region, Wander carries with him a body wrapped in a cloak, which he lays upon an altar in the shrine. Removing the cloak, the body of a maiden named &#34;Mono&#34; is revealed. A moment later, several shadow-like creatures with humanoid forms appear and prepare to attack Wander, but he easily dismisses them with a wave of an ancient sword in his possession. After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as &#34;Dormin&#34; echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono&#39;s soul to her body, which they state may be possible, but only if the sixteen <a href="/wiki/Cult_image" id="w">idols</a> lining the temple&#39;s hall are destroyed. They explain that this task can only be accomplished by using the ancient sword to kill sixteen colossi located throughout the land. Each contains a portion of Dormin&#39;s own essence, though this is not revealed until late in the game.<sup id="_ref-dorminsealed_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dorminsealed" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dorminrequest_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dorminrequest" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite a warning from Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono,<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them. With the death of each colossus, his physical appearance deteriorates, his skin becoming paler and his hair darker. Meanwhile, Mono&#39;s complexion improves and her voice can be faintly heard after each colossus has been killed. After the death of the twelfth, it is revealed to the player that Wander is being pursued by a group of warriors led by the shaman called &#34;Lord Emon&#34;. </p>
<p>Urged to hurry with his task by Dormin, Wander soon heads off to defeat the sixteenth and final colossus. On the way to this confrontation, he travels on horseback across a long bridge, which begins to collapse as he is halfway across.  As Agro jumps over the last gap in the bridge, the portion he lands on begins to separate from its foundation, causing Agro to nearly lose his footing. Sensing the impending fall, Agro jerks forward to throw Wander to safety on the other side, sacrificing himself as the bridge finally gives way and he falls into the river hundreds of feet below. Lord Emon&#39;s company arrives in the Shrine of Worship just as the last temple idol crumbles, and Wander appears soon after, his eyes and skin now both entirely pale, and two small horns protruding from his head. Declaring that Wander has been possessed, Lord Emon orders his warriors to kill him.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> While he struggles to reach Mono, one warrior shoots Wander in the leg with a <a href="/wiki/Crossbow" id="w">crossbow</a>, while another stabs him through his heart with a sword. Black blood sprays from the wound as Wander&#39;s body becomes covered in darkness and falls to the floor—a death identical to those suffered by the colossi.</p>
<p>Afterward, Dormin&#39;s spirit possesses Wander&#39;s body, transforming it into a shadowy giant. They explain that their own body was separated to seal away their power.<sup id="_ref-dorminsealed_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dorminsealed" title="">[22]</a></sup> While his men flee, Lord Emon casts the ancient sword used to kill the colossi into a small pool at the back of the temple&#39;s hall, creating a whirlwind of light that consumes both Dormin and Wander. Emon and his men flee the forbidden land as the bridge connecting to the temple collapses behind them. As they safely arrive at the entrance to the forbidden land, Emon expresses hope that if Wander survived, he will someday be able to atone for his actions.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the temple, Mono awakens, restored by Dormin in accordance with their agreement with Wander, and Agro limps into the temple with a broken (or possibly heavily sprained) hind leg. Mono follows him to the pool into which Wander and Dormin were pulled by Emon&#39;s spell, finding a male <a href="/wiki/Infant" id="w">infant</a> with tiny <a href="/wiki/Horn_(anatomy)" id="w">horns</a> on his head. She takes the child with her, following the horse to higher levels of the Shrine of Worship, and arrives at a secret garden within the shrine as the game ends.</p>

However, during an interview in March 2006, Ueda revealed that a specific connection between the two games exists: the world featured in the two is the same, with <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> taking place at an unspecified time before <i>Ico</i>. He revealed that Wander sires the line of horned boys of which <i>Ico</i>&#39;s protagonist is a descendant.<sup id="_ref-behindtheshadow_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-behindtheshadow" title="">[5]</a></sup> Moreover, the shadowy figures which appear in the Shrine of Worship are connected to the shadows which the player must fight in <i>Ico</i>.<sup id="_ref-official site_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-official site" title="">[21]</a></sup> Both games use unique <a href="/wiki/Artistic_language" id="w">fictional languages</a> as well.<sup id="_ref-languages_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-languages" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-languages2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-languages2" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

With a team of thirty-five people, <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> began development in <a href="/wiki/2002_in_video_gaming" id="w">2002</a> under the project name &#34;<i>Nico</i>&#34; and was intended to be a direct sequel to <i>Ico</i>.<sup id="_ref-psau_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-psau" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-makingcolossalgames_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingcolossalgames" title="">[35]</a></sup> The name &#34;<i>Nico</i>&#34; itself is a <a href="/wiki/Portmanteau" id="w">portmanteau</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_language" id="w">Japanese</a> word <i>ni</i> (二; &#34;two&#34;) and &#34;<i>Ico</i>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-psau_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-psau" title="">[3]</a></sup> An early <a href="/wiki/Technology_demo" id="w">technology demo</a> for the project shown at the DICE Summit in <a href="/wiki/2003_in_video_gaming" id="w">2003</a> depicted a group of masked, horned boys riding horses while attacking and defeating a colossus.<sup id="_ref-psau_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-psau" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-makingcolossalgames_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingcolossalgames" title="">[35]</a></sup> However, Fumito Ueda expressed that, at the time, it was simpler to reuse the character design of <i>Ico</i>&#39;s protagonist, and that he never explicitly desired a sequel to <i>Ico</i>.<sup id="_ref-psnz_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-psnz" title="">[36]</a></sup> Japanese <a href="/wiki/Pre-order" id="w">pre-orders</a> of <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> later included a bonus <a href="/wiki/DVD" id="w">DVD</a> with the concept video, a trailer describing <i>Nico</i>&#39;s plot, and an introduction the development team states they wanted to use in <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i>.</p>
<p>Ueda and producer Kenji Kaido held their team to a high standard throughout production. An admitted perfectionist, Ueda felt that only one or two out of 500 artists who applied to work on <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> met his criteria, and often demanded thorough changes in design until it matched his vision.<sup id="_ref-makingcolossalgames_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingcolossalgames" title="">[35]</a></sup> For his part, Kaido challenged the programmers to meet the concept of realistic physics in relation to the movement of the colossi and the subsequent effect this movement would have for Wander, both in terms of how he might be displaced and how he may be able to use this movement to his advantage. For instance, if a colossus were to shake, Kaido wanted Wander&#39;s position to shift realistically in response. Additionally, if a colossus&#39; limb was currently horizontal, Kaido wanted the player to be able to run across the limb as though it were any other flat surface. He referred to these two concepts as &#34;player dynamics and reactions&#34; and &#34;organic collision deformation&#34;.<sup id="_ref-makingcolossalgames_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingcolossalgames" title="">[35]</a></sup> The realistic physics engine produced as a result required that faster colossi had to be smaller as well.<sup id="_ref-psnz_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-psnz" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>

Ueda wished the game to have a unique presentation<sup id="_ref-colossalcreation_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colossalcreation" title="">[4]</a></sup> and change how both players and developers perceived the idea of what <a href="/wiki/Boss_(video_games)" id="w">bosses</a> should be in video games. To achieve this, he ensured that the game&#39;s only enemies would be the sixteen colossi, that they could only be approached one at a time, and that they would have various behavior patterns.<sup id="_ref-psnz_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-psnz" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1up_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1up" title="">[37]</a></sup> Though limiting the presence of enemies to only bosses was partly intended to differentiate the game from others, Ueda also expressed that it was to ensure that the programmers&#39; focus was entirely on the colossi so that their quality would be as high as possible.<sup id="_ref-behindtheshadow_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-behindtheshadow" title="">[5]</a></sup> In accordance with this focus upon the colossi—and his preference for simple controls—he intended that one button on the <a href="/wiki/Game_controller" id="w">game controller</a> be used solely for targeting the colossi during battles.<sup id="_ref-1up_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1up" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>A theme of companionship between the player and an <a href="/wiki/Game_artificial_intelligence" id="w">AI</a>-controlled partner was a concern for Ueda.<sup id="_ref-1up_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1up" title="">[37]</a></sup> In <i>Ico</i>, this theme was presented through the protagonist and the character Yorda, whom the player was required to work with and protect while navigating the game&#39;s environments.<sup id="_ref-1up2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1up2" title="">[38]</a></sup> As such, another key element in <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> is the relationship between Wander and his horse, Agro.<sup id="_ref-ignpreview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignpreview" title="">[12]</a></sup> Intended to be a realistic representation of a horse, Agro does not always respond to commands.

It&#39;s not like a car or a motorcycle, it won&#39;t always turn when you say &#39;turn!&#39;&#34; However, he has admitted that the team had to seek a balance in how often Agro didn&#39;t respond to commands so as to not sacrifice playability in the pursuit of realism.<sup id="_ref-1up_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1up" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>All elements of the game—including audio, gameplay and visuals—were used to achieve an atmosphere of a &#34;lonely hero&#34;, which Ueda considered important in the development of the game. Lighting, in particular, was used to establish a dark, fearsome setting for the forbidden land, while the protagonist&#39;s sword would provide a means of navigation that was &#34;direct and only expressible visually&#34;.<sup id="_ref-1up2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1up2" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>Like <i>Ico</i>, <i>Shadow</i> uses a distinct style of lighting. The game&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Game_engine" id="w">engine</a> uses elements such as <a href="/wiki/Saturation_(color_theory)" id="w">desaturated colors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Motion_blur" id="w">motion blur</a> and partial <a href="/wiki/High_dynamic_range_rendering" id="w">high dynamic range rendering</a>, with a heavy emphasis on <a href="/wiki/Bloom_(shader_effect)" id="w">bloom lighting</a>.<sup id="_ref-eurogamer_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eurogamer" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-makingofsotc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingofsotc" title="">[39]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ignpreview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignpreview" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

While the game has an extensive orchestral soundtrack, the music is only heard during <a href="/wiki/Cut_scene" id="w">cut scenes</a> and colossi encounters, while time spent at the Shrine of Worship and traversing the landscape is silent save for the sounds made by the protagonist, his horse and their surroundings.<sup id="_ref-shadowreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shadowreview" title="">[40]</a></sup> The open nature of the game world and lack of life, coupled with this limited use of music, aids in establishing an atmosphere of solitude,<sup id="_ref-1up2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1up2" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-instantreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-instantreview" title="">[41]</a></sup> similar to that of Ico.<sup id="_ref-ignreview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignreview" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus:_Roar_of_the_Earth" id="w">Roar of the Earth</a></i> is the <a href="/wiki/Soundtrack" id="w">soundtrack</a> to <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i>. It was released in Japan on <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005_in_music" id="w">2005</a>. There are currently no announced plans to release the album in other territories. The game&#39;s score was composed by <a href="/wiki/K%C5%8D_%C5%8Ctani" id="w">Kō Ōtani</a> (credited in-game as &#34;Kow Otani&#34;), whose previous video game work included the soundtracks to the PlayStation 2 flight simulator <i><a href="/wiki/Sky_Odyssey" id="w">Sky Odyssey</a></i> and the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation" id="w">PlayStation</a> shooter <i><a href="/wiki/Philosoma" id="w">Philosoma</a></i>. He has also worked on several of the 1990s-era <a href="/wiki/Gamera" id="w">Gamera</a> films, as well as a variety of <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a>. <i>Roar of the Earth</i> won the award for &#34;Soundtrack of the Year&#34; in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">US</a>-based <a href="/wiki/Video_game_magazine" id="w">video game magazine</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly" id="w">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-egmsoty_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-egmsoty" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<a id="PAL_version" name="PAL_version"></a><h1>PAL version</h1>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/PAL_region" id="w">PAL</a> version of the game was released in February 2006. Much like the PAL release for <i>Ico</i>, the game came in cardboard packaging displaying various pieces of artwork from the game, and contained four art cards.<sup id="_ref-extrasandico_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-extrasandico" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-extrasandico2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-extrasandico2" title="">[44]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-artcards_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-artcards" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>The game also came with a &#34;making of&#34; documentary, a trailer for <i>Ico</i> and a gallery of <a href="/wiki/Concept_art" id="w">concept art</a>, accessible from the game&#39;s main menu.<sup id="_ref-extrasandico_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-extrasandico" title="">[43]</a></sup> Sony Computer Entertainment also re-released <i>Ico</i> in PAL territories at the time of <i>Shadow</i>&#39;s release, both to promote the game through <i>Ico</i>&#39;s reputation, and to allow players who did not buy <i>Ico</i> during its original limited release to complete their collections.<sup id="_ref-extrasandico_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-extrasandico" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-extrasandico2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-extrasandico2" title="">[44]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-icorerelease_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-icorerelease" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some confusion has arisen in PAL regions concerning the official name of the protagonist, due primarily to the manual&#39;s usage of &#34;Wanda&#34;, while the North American manual and the game itself uses the name &#34;Wander&#34;. The name ワンダ (<i>Wanda</i>), as written in this title, is in fact the common transliteration of the English name &#34;Wanda&#34;.  The English word &#34;wonder&#34; is written as ワンダー (<i>wandaa</i>), with a long <i>a</i>.  The long <i>a</i> is the standard transliteration for the English -er ending.</p>
<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h1>Reception</h1>
<p><i>Shadow of the Colossus</i>&#39;s commercial reception was positive, with sales of 140,000 copies in its first week at retail in Japan, reaching number one in the charts. Almost 80% of the initial Japanese shipment was sold within two days.<sup id="_ref-sales_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sales" title="">[47]</a></sup> These figures compare favorably with <i>Ico</i>, which was well received by critics but failed to sell a significant number of copies.<sup id="_ref-sales2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sales2" title="">[48]</a></sup> The game was placed on Sony&#39;s list of <a href="/wiki/List_of_Sony_Greatest_Hits_games" id="w">Greatest Hits</a> titles on August 8, 2006.<sup id="_ref-greatesthits_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-greatesthits" title="">[49]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-greatesthits2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-greatesthits2" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unlike <i>Ico</i>, <i>Shadow</i> received far more exposure, due in part to Sony putting its weight behind a massive advertising campaign.<sup id="_ref-kikizo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kikizo" title="">[51]</a></sup> It was advertised in game magazines, on <a href="/wiki/Television_advertisement" id="w">television</a> and on the <a href="/wiki/Internet_marketing" id="w">internet</a>, including a <a href="/wiki/Viral_marketing" id="w">viral marketing</a> campaign that was launched by a website called &#34;<a class="externallink" href="http://giantology.typepad.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://giantology.typepad.com/">Giantology</a>&#34; in October 2005. The site posted links to several websites claiming that the remains of five giants resembling certain colossi had been discovered in various parts of the world. The website has since been taken down. Some speculate that <i>Ico</i>&#39;s sales figures could have been improved if similar advertising efforts were made before its release.<sup id="_ref-eurogamer2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eurogamer2" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>

Many reviewers consider the game&#39;s soundtrack to be one of its greatest aspects.

However, the game has been negatively criticised for its erratic <a href="/wiki/Frame_rate" id="w">frame rate</a>, which is usually smooth while traversing the landscape, but often slows down in fast-paced situations, such as colossus battles.<sup id="_ref-gamespotreview_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespotreview" title="">[6]</a></sup> Concern was also expressed about the game&#39;s camera, which was described by GameSpy as being &#34;as much of an opponent as the Colossi&#34;, &#34;manag[ing] to re-center itself at the worst and most inopportune times&#34;.<sup id="_ref-gamespyreview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespyreview" title="">[14]</a></sup> Reviewers are often mixed about Agro&#39;s AI and controls, while gaming website Thunderbolt insists the realism of his movement and behaviour &#34;create[s] a videogame experience unlike any other&#34;<sup id="_ref-thunderbolt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thunderbolt" title="">[59]</a></sup>. <i>Edge</i> comments that the controls are &#34;clumsy, crude, and unpredictable&#34;.<sup id="_ref-edge_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-edge" title="">[55]</a></sup> Other critics like <a href="/wiki/Game_Revolution" id="w">Game Revolution</a><sup id="_ref-gamespyreview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespyreview" title="">[14]</a></sup> and Gamespot felt the game was too short-lived (average playthrough time estimated 6 to 8 hours), with little replay value.
