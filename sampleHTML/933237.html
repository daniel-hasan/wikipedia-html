<p>The <b>Black Racer</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Fictional" id="w">fictional</a> <a href="/wiki/Deity" id="w">deity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Avatar" id="w">avatar</a> of <a href="/wiki/Death_(DC_Comics)" id="w">death</a> published by <a href="/wiki/DC_Comics" id="w">DC Comics</a>. he first appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/New_Gods" id="w">New Gods</a></i> vol. 1 #3 (July 1971), and was created by <a href="/wiki/Jack_Kirby" id="w">Jack Kirby</a>.</p>

<p>The Black Racer&#39;s corporeal form is that of the otherwise bedridden Sgt. <b>Willie Walker</b>, who was paralyzed during the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" id="w">Vietnam War</a>. Walker was contacted by the Source when <a href="/wiki/Darkseid" id="w">Darkseid</a> first brought the war of the gods to Earth, and told it was his responsibility to take on the role.
The Racer makes use of skis as his means of transport, much as <a href="/wiki/Silver_Surfer" id="w">Silver Surfer</a> (another Kirby creation) used a surfboard for transportation through space. This similarity is commented on in an issue of <a href="/wiki/Young_Justice" id="w">Young Justice</a>; when told that &#34;Death is coming...on skis!&#34; Superboy remarks &#34;Skis? What&#39;s next, <a href="/wiki/Silver_Surfer" id="w">a surfboard</a>?&#34;. New Gods are collected by the Racer at the moment of their deaths, and taken to Hadis (the Fourth World version of <a href="/wiki/Hades" id="w">Hades</a>).</p>
<p>According to <i><a href="/wiki/Captain_Atom" id="w">Captain Atom</a></i> #42 the Black Racer represents &#34;death as inevitability&#34;, whereas <a href="/wiki/Death_(DC_Comics)" id="w">Death of the Endless</a> represents &#34;death as compassionate release&#34;. This has been contested by <a href="/wiki/Neil_Gaiman" id="w">Neil Gaiman</a>, who says that Death of the Endless is the ultimate incarnation of death in the <a href="/wiki/DC_Universe" id="w">DC Universe</a>. However,in <i>Adventures of Superman</i> # 500, part of the <a href="/wiki/Death_of_Superman" id="w">Death of Superman</a> storyline, <a href="/wiki/Ma_and_Pa_Kent" id="w">Jonathan Kent</a> ventures into the afterlife where his guide is none other than the Black Racer (Apparently, Death of the Endless could not be used). </p>
<p>During the <i><a href="/wiki/Our_Worlds_at_War" id="w">Our Worlds at War</a></i> crossover, he came to harvest <a href="/wiki/John_Henry_Irons" id="w">Steel&#39;s</a> soul, but <a href="/wiki/Superman" id="w">Superman</a> talked him out of it. In the <i>Darkseid Vs. Galactus</i> crossover, <a href="/wiki/Silver_Surfer" id="w">Silver Surfer</a> talked the Racer from claiming <a href="/wiki/Orion_(comics)" id="w">Orion</a>. This was a highly unusual occurrence; the Black Racer is usually implacable.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Grant_Morrison" id="w">Grant Morrison</a>&#39;s miniseries <i><a href="/wiki/Seven_Soldiers" id="w">Seven Soldiers</a>: <a href="/wiki/Mister_Miracle" id="w">Mister Miracle</a></i>, the Black Racer appears as a wheelchair-bound man (probably <i>not</i> Willie Walker, as he appears Caucasian), following the destruction of <a href="/wiki/Apokolips" id="w">Apokolips</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_Genesis" id="w">New Genesis</a>. He has a bet with <a href="/wiki/Metron_(comics)" id="w">Metron</a> as to whether Mister Miracle will be successful in saving the New Gods.  </p>
<a id="Death_of_the_New_Gods" name="Death_of_the_New_Gods"></a><h2>Death of the New Gods</h2>

<p>Willie Walker was killed in the first issue of the eight-part <i><a href="/wiki/Death_of_the_New_Gods" id="w">Death of the New Gods</a></i> mini-series. He was killed by an unidentified figure who tore his heart out. Serifan of the <a href="/wiki/Forever_People" id="w">Forever People</a> was seen exiting the room after his death.</p>
