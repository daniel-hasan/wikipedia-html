<b>USS <i>Illinois</i> (BB-65)</b> was to be the fifth {{sclass}} constructed for the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" id="w">United States Navy</a>; she was the fourth ship to be <a href="/wiki/Ship_naming_and_launching" id="w">named</a> in honor of <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">the 21st state</a>. Among the {{sclass}}s, <i>Illinois</i> is notable for being one of the two uncompleted battleships, and for being the only member of the class not considered for a rebuild of any kind.</p>
<p>Hull BB-65 was originally to be the first ship of the {{sclass}}s, but changes during the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a> resulted in her being reordered as an {{sclass}} midway through the war. This allowed her to gain eight knots in speed, the ability to transit the locks of the <a href="/wiki/Panama_Canal" id="w">Panama Canal</a>, and to increase the number of anti-aircraft guns. The cost was the loss of her additional armor and a reduction in the heavier armaments that were to have been added to BB-65 during her time on the drawing board as USS <i>Montana</i>. </p>
<p>Like her sister ship {{USS}}, <i>Illinois</i> was still under construction at the end of World War II. Her construction was canceled in August 1945, but her hull remained until 1958 when it was broken up. Because <i>Illinois</i> was only 22% complete at the time she was not considered for any significant rebuild programs, while several proposals were floated to complete her sister ship <i>Kentucky</i> as a guided missile battleship.</p>

<p>{{main}}
BB-65 began life in mid-1930s as the USS <i>Montana</i>, the lead ship of her class of dreadnought battleships. She would have fielded three more 16-in guns than those mounted aboard the <i>Iowa</i>-class, a more powerful secondary battery of <a href="/wiki/5%26quot%3B/54_caliber_Mark_45_gun" id="w">5”/54 caliber DP mounts</a>,<sup id="_ref-navwep2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-navwep2" title="">[1]</a></sup> an increase in armor that was to enable <i>Montana</i> to withstand the effects of the 16”/50 caliber guns and the 2,700 <a href="/wiki/Pound_(mass)" id="w">lb</a> ammunition she and her <i>Iowa</i>-class sisters were to carry. The increase in <i>Montana’s</i> firepower and armor came at the expense of her speed and her <a href="/wiki/Panamax" id="w">Panamax</a> capabilities, but the latter issue was to be resolved through the construction of a third, much wider set of locks at the <a href="/wiki/Panama_Canal" id="w">Panama Canal</a>,  which would have enabled <i>Montana</i> to transit between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans without the need to move around the tip of South America.<sup id="_ref-friedman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friedman" title="">[2]</a></sup>  As USS <i>Montana,</i> BB-65 would have the only battleship class <a href="/wiki/Ship_commissioning" id="w">commissioned</a> by the U.S. to have come close to equaling the <a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" id="w">Empire of Japan</a>&#39;s {{sclass}}s on the basis of armor, armament, and tonnage.<sup id="_ref-gs1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gs1" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-magazine_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-magazine" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>By 1942 the United States Navy shifted its building focus from battleships to <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_carrier" id="w">aircraft carriers</a> after the successes of carrier combat in both the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Coral_Sea" id="w">Battle of Coral Sea</a> and to a greater extent the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Midway" id="w">Battle of Midway</a>. As a result the construction of the U.S. fleet of {{sclass}}s had been given the highest priority for completion in the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Shipyard" id="w">shipyards</a>.<sup id="_ref-magazine_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-magazine" title="">[4]</a></sup> The <i>Essex</i>-class carriers were proving vital to the war effort by allowing the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" id="w">Allies</a> to gain and maintain <a href="/wiki/Air_supremacy" id="w">air supremacy</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Theatre_of_World_War_II" id="w">Pacific Theatre of World War II</a>, and were rapidly becoming the principle striking arm of the United States in the ongoing effort to defeat the Empire of Japan.<sup id="_ref-discovery_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-discovery" title="">[5]</a></sup> It was for this reason that the United States accepted certain shortcomings in the armor for their {{sclass}}s, <a href="/wiki/South_Dakota_class_battleship_(1939)" id="w">&#39;&#39;South Dakota&#39;&#39;-class battleships</a>, and {{sclass}}s in favor of their additional speed, which enabled these battleship classes to steam at a comparable speed with the <i>Essex</i>-class and provide the carriers with the maximum amount of anti-aircraft protection.<sup id="_ref-discovery_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-discovery" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h2>Development</h2>
<p>When BB-65 was redesignated an {{sclass}}, she was assigned the name <i>Illinois</i> and reconfigured to adhere to the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Fast_battleship" id="w">fast battleship</a>&#34; designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the <a href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Construction_and_Repair" id="w">Bureau of Construction and Repair</a>.<sup id="_ref-The Battleships II_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Battleships II" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> She would now be the fifth of the six authorized ships of the {{sclass}} of battleships.<sup id="_ref-Illinois_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Illinois" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-The Battleships II_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Battleships II" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Like her <i>Iowa</i>-class sisters, <i>Illinois</i> was to cost $125 million and take roughly 30 to 40 months to complete.<sup id="_ref-gs design_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gs design" title="">[9]</a></sup> Her <a href="/wiki/Keel" id="w">keel</a> was laid down at the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Naval_Shipyard" id="w">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a> on <a href="/wiki/15_January" id="w">15 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[10]</a></sup> Like <i>Kentucky</i>, <i>Illinois</i> differed from her earlier sisters in that her design called for an all-welded construction, which would have saved weight and increased strength over a combination riveted/welded hull of the type used on the four completed <i>Iowa</i>-class ships. Engineers considered retaining the original {{sclass}}-type armor for added <a href="/wiki/Torpedo" id="w">torpedo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Naval_mine" id="w">naval mine</a> protection (the newer scheme would have improved <i>Illinois</i>’ armor protection by as much as 20%);<sup id="_ref-armor_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-armor" title="">[11]</a></sup> however, this was rejected due to time constraints and because <i>Illinois</i> was being built along the regular <i>Iowa</i>-class hull design.<sup id="_ref-math_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-math" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Bell from the USS <i>Illinois</i></div></div>

<i>Illinois</i> construction was canceled and then <a href="/wiki/Ship_breaking" id="w">scrapped</a> after the <a href="/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki" id="w">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>.<sup id="_ref-Illinois_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Illinois" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-The Battleships II_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Battleships II" title="">[6]</a></sup> She was struck from the <a href="/wiki/Naval_Vessel_Register" id="w">Naval Vessel Register</a> on <a href="/wiki/12_August" id="w">12 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>,<sup id="_ref-DANFS_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Illinois II_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Illinois II" title="">[13]</a></sup> but her incomplete hull (at the time 22% finished) was retained along with her sister <i>Kentucky</i> until 1958 when both incomplete ships were broken up. She was scrapped in her dry dock on the builder&#39;s ways starting in September 1958.<sup id="_ref-NIP History_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIP History" title="">[14]</a></sup> Although her sister ship <a href="/wiki/USS_Kentucky_(BB-66)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Kentucky&#39;&#39;</a> (BB-66) was considered for a rebuild to make her into a guided missile battleship (BBG)&#8212;by removing the aft turret and installing a missile system&#8212;at the time of her cancellation, <i>Kentucky</i> was 73.1% complete with construction halted at the 1st deck.<sup id="_ref-math_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-math" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Kentucky II_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kentucky II" title="">[15]</a></sup> By contrast, the <i>Illinois</i> was only 22% complete and thus was not afforded the same option. </p>
<p>While the ship herself was never completed, the ship&#39;s bell was cast, and it currently resides at <a href="/wiki/Memorial_Stadium_(Champaign)" id="w">Memorial Stadium</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign" id="w">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>; it reads <i>USS Illinois 1946</i>. Although the University of Illinois records are unclear as to whether the bell was donated to the University in general or the Naval <a href="/wiki/Reserve_Officer_Training_Corps" id="w">Reserve Officer Training Corps</a> (NROTC) at the University specifically, the bell has found a new home with the <a href="/wiki/Fighting_Illini" id="w">Fighting Illini</a> football team, and is traditionally rung by NROTC members in a cumulative manner when the football team scores a touchdown or goal.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
