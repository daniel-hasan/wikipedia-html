<p>The term <i>parapsychology</i> was coined in or before 1889 by psychologist <a href="/wiki/Max_Dessoir" id="w">Max Dessoir</a>. It was adopted by <a href="/wiki/J.B._Rhine" id="w">J.B.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Society_for_Psychical_Research" id="w">Society for Psychical Research</a> (SPR) was founded in London in 1882. The formation of the SPR was the first systematic effort to organize scientists and scholars for a critical and sustained investigation of paranormal phenomena. The early membership of the SPR included philosophers, scholars, scientists, educators and politicians, such as <a href="/wiki/Henry_Sidgwick" id="w">Henry Sidgwick</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Balfour" id="w">Arthur Balfour</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Crookes" id="w">William Crookes</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Charles_Richet" id="w">Charles Richet</a>.<sup id="_ref-Beloff_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Beloff" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The SPR classified its subjects of study into several areas: <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" id="w">telepathy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hypnotism" id="w">hypnotism</a>, Reichenbach&#39;s phenomena, <a href="/wiki/Apparitional_experiences" id="w">apparitions</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hauntings" id="w">haunts</a>, and the physical aspects of <a href="/wiki/Spiritualism" id="w">spiritualism</a> such as table-tilting and the appearance of matter from unknown sources, otherwise known as <a href="/wiki/Materialization_(paranormal)" id="w">materialization</a>. One of the first collaborative efforts of the SPR was its <i>Census of Hallucinations</i>, which researched apparitional experiences and <a href="/wiki/Hallucinations_in_the_sane" id="w">hallucinations in the sane</a>. The census was the Society&#39;s first attempt at a statistical evaluation of paranormal phenomena, and the resulting publication in 1886, <i>Phantasms of the Living</i> is still widely referenced in parapsychological literature today. The SPR became the model for similar societies in other European countries and the United States during the late 19th century. Largely due to the support of psychologist <a href="/wiki/William_James" id="w">William James</a>, the <a href="/wiki/American_Society_for_Psychical_Research" id="w">American Society for Psychical Research</a> (ASPR) opened its doors in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> in 1885.<sup id="_ref-Berger_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Berger" title="">[9]</a></sup></p> 
<p>Today, the SPR and ASPR continue the investigation of <a href="/wiki/Psi_(parapsychology)" id="w">psi phenomena</a>.

<a id="Rhine_era" name="Rhine_era"></a><h2>Rhine era</h2>

<p>In 1911, <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" id="w">Stanford University</a> became the first academic institution in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> to study <a href="/wiki/Extra-sensory_perception" id="w">extra-sensory perception</a> (ESP) and <a href="/wiki/Psychokinesis" id="w">psychokinesis</a> (PK) in a laboratory setting. The effort was headed by psychologist John Edgar Coover. In 1930, <a href="/wiki/Duke_University" id="w">Duke University</a> became the second major U.S. academic institution to engage in the critical study of ESP and psychokinesis in the laboratory. Under the guidance of psychologist <a href="/wiki/William_McDougall" id="w">William McDougall</a>, and with the help of others in the department—including psychologists <a href="/wiki/Karl_Zener" id="w">Karl Zener</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_B._Rhine" id="w">Joseph B. Rhine</a>, and Louisa E. Rhine—laboratory ESP experiments using volunteer subjects from the undergraduate student body began.  As opposed to the approaches of psychical research, which generally sought <a href="/wiki/Qualitative_research" id="w">qualitative evidence</a> for paranormal phenomena, the experiments at Duke University proffered a <a href="/wiki/Quantitative_research" id="w">  quantitative</a>, <a href="/wiki/Statistical" id="w">statistical</a> approach using <a href="/wiki/Zener_cards" id="w">cards</a> and dice.  As a consequence of the ESP experiments at Duke, standard laboratory procedures for the testing of ESP developed and came to be adopted by interested researchers throughout the world.<sup id="_ref-Berger_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Berger" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The publication of J.B. Rhine&#39;s book, <i>New Frontiers of the Mind</i> (1937) brought the laboratory&#39;s findings to the general public. In his book, Rhine popularized the word &#34;parapsychology,&#34; which psychologist <a href="/wiki/Max_Dessoir" id="w">Max Dessoir</a> had coined over 40 years earlier, to describe the research conducted at Duke.  Rhine also founded an autonomous Parapsychology Laboratory within Duke and started the <i><a href="/wiki/Journal_of_Parapsychology" id="w">Journal of Parapsychology</a></i>, which he co-edited with McDougall.  </p>
<p>The parapsychology experiments at Duke evoked much criticism from academic psychologists who challenged the concepts and evidence of ESP. Rhine and his colleagues attempted to address these criticisms through new experiments, articles, and books, and summarized the state of the criticism along with their responses in the book <i>Extra-Sensory Perception After Sixty Years</i>.</p>
<p>The administration of Duke grew less sympathetic to parapsychology, and after Rhine&#39;s retirement in 1965 parapsychological links with the university were broken. Rhine later established the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man (FRNM) and the Institute for Parapsychology as a successor to the Duke laboratory.<sup id="_ref-Berger_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Berger" title="">[9]</a></sup>  In 1995, the centenary of Rhine&#39;s birth, the FRNM was renamed the Rhine Research Center. Today, the Rhine Research Center is a parapsychology research unit, stating that it &#34;aims to improve the human condition by creating a scientific understanding of those abilities and sensitivities that appear to transcend the ordinary limits of space and time.&#34;<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Establishment_of_the_Parapsychological_Association" name="Establishment_of_the_Parapsychological_Association"></a><h2>Establishment of the Parapsychological Association</h2>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Parapsychological_Association" id="w">Parapsychological Association</a> (PA) was created in <a href="/wiki/Durham%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Durham, North Carolina</a>, on <a href="/wiki/June_19" id="w">June 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1957" id="w">1957</a>. Its formation was proposed by J. B. Rhine at a workshop on parapsychology which was held at the Parapsychology Laboratory of Duke University. Rhine proposed that the group form itself into the nucleus of an international professional society in parapsychology. The aim of the organization, as stated in its Constitution, became &#34;to advance parapsychology as a science, to disseminate knowledge of the field, and to integrate the findings with those of other branches of science&#34;.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Under the direction of anthropologist <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Mead" id="w">Margaret Mead</a>, the Parapsychological Association took a large step in advancing the field of parapsychology in 1969 when it became affiliated with the <a href="/wiki/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science" id="w">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> (AAAS), the largest general scientific society in the world.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>  In 1979, physicist <a href="/wiki/John_A._Wheeler" id="w">John A.

His challenge to parapsychology&#39;s AAAS affiliation was unsuccessful.<sup id="_ref-Wheeler_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wheeler" title="">[14]</a></sup> Today, the PA consists of about three hundred full, associate, and affiliated members worldwide and maintains its affiliation with the AAAS.<sup id="_ref-Harvey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Harvey" title="">[15]</a></sup> The annual AAAS convention provides a forum where parapsychologists can present their research to scientists from other fields and advance parapsychology in the context of the AAAS&#39;s lobbying on national science policy.<sup id="_ref-Harvey_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Harvey" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Decade_of_increased_research_(1970s)" name="Decade_of_increased_research_(1970s)"></a><h2>Decade of increased research (1970s)</h2>

<p>The affiliation of the Parapsychological Association (PA) with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, along with a general openness to psychic and <a href="/wiki/Occult" id="w">occult</a> phenomena in the 1970s, led to a decade of increased parapsychological research. During this period, other notable organizations were also formed, including the Academy of Parapsychology and Medicine (1970), the Institute of Parascience (1971), the Academy of Religion and Psychical Research, the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Noetic_Sciences" id="w">Institute of Noetic Sciences</a> (1973), the International Kirlian Research Association (1975), and the <a href="/wiki/Princeton_Engineering_Anomalies_Research_Laboratory" id="w">Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory</a> (1979). Parapsychological work was also conducted at the <a href="/wiki/Stanford_Research_Institute" id="w">Stanford Research Institute</a> (SRI) during this time.<sup id="_ref-Melton_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melton" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The scope of parapsychology expanded during these years. Psychiatrist <a href="/wiki/Ian_Stevenson" id="w">Ian Stevenson</a> conducted much of his controversial research into <a href="/wiki/Reincarnation" id="w">reincarnation</a> during the 1970s. Psychologist <a href="/wiki/Thelma_Moss" id="w">Thelma Moss</a> devoted time to the study of <a href="/wiki/Kirlian_photography" id="w">Kirlian photography</a> at <a href="/wiki/UCLA" id="w">UCLA</a>&#39;s parapsychology laboratory. The influx of spiritual teachers from Asia, and their claims of abilities produced by <a href="/wiki/Meditation" id="w">meditation</a>, led to research on <a href="/wiki/Altered_states_of_consciousness" id="w">altered states of consciousness</a>. Physicist <a href="/wiki/Russell_Targ" id="w">Russell Targ</a> coined the term <a href="/wiki/Remote_viewing" id="w">remote viewing</a> for use in some of his <a href="/wiki/Early_psi_research_at_SRI" id="w">work at SRI</a> in 1974.<sup id="_ref-Melton_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melton" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>During this period, academics outside parapsychology also appeared to have a general optimism towards this research. In 1979, a survey of more than 1,100 college professors in the United States found that only 2% of <a href="/wiki/Psychologists" id="w">psychologists</a> expressed the belief that <a href="/wiki/Extra-sensory_perception" id="w">extra-sensory perception</a> was an impossibility. A far greater number, 34%, indicated that they believed <a href="/wiki/ESP" id="w">ESP</a> was either an established fact or a likely possibility.

<p>The surge in paranormal research continued throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s. By the end of the 1980s, the Parapsychological Association reported members working in more than 30 countries.

</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Ganzfeld_experiment" id="w"> ganzfeld</a> (German for &#34;whole field&#34;) is a technique used to test individuals for telepathy.  The technique was developed to quickly quiet mental &#34;noise&#34; by providing a mild, unpatterned sensory field to mask the <a href="/wiki/Visual" id="w">visual</a> and <a href="/wiki/Auditory" id="w">auditory</a> environment. Isolating the visual sense is usually achieved by creating a soft red glow which is diffused through half ping-pong balls attached to the recipient&#39;s eyes. The auditory sense is usually blocked by playing white noise, static, or similar sounds to the recipient. The subject is also seated in a reclined, comfortable position to minimize the sense of touch. </p>
<p>In the typical ganzfeld experiment, a &#34;sender&#34; and &#34;receiver&#34; are isolated.  The receiver is put into the ganzfeld state, and the sender is shown a video clip or still picture and asked to mentally send that image to the receiver. The receiver, while in the ganzfeld, is asked to continuously speak aloud all mental processes, including images, thoughts, and feelings. At the end of the sending period, typically about 20 to 40 minutes in length, the receiver is taken out of the ganzfeld and shown four images or videos, one of which is the true target and three are non-target decoys. The receiver attempts to select the true target, using perceptions experienced during the ganzfeld state as clues to what the mentally &#34;sent&#34; image might have been. </p>
<p>According to parapsychologists such as <a href="/wiki/Dean_Radin" id="w">Dean Radin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Honorton" id="w">Charles Honorton</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Daryl_Bem" id="w">Daryl Bem</a>, the results of ganzfeld experiments—collectively gathered from over 3,000 individual sessions conducted by about two dozen investigators world-wide—indicate that, on average, the target image is selected by the receiver more often than would be expected by chance alone.<sup id="_ref-Radnin97_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Radnin97" title="">[19]</a></sup> Because these meta analyses of ganzfeld results are said to be <a href="/wiki/Statistical_significance" id="w"> statistically significant</a>, they have sparked debates within mainstream academic psychology journals over how to properly interpret the data.<sup id="_ref-Honorton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Honorton" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Remote_viewing" name="Remote_viewing"></a><h4>Remote viewing</h4>

<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Remote viewing experiments test the ability to gather information on a remote target consisting of an object, place, or person that is hidden from the physical perception of the viewer and typically separated from the viewer at some distance. In one type of remote viewing experiment, a pool of several hundred photographs are created. One of these is randomly selected by a third party to be the target.  It is then set aside in a remote location. The remote viewer attempts to sketch or otherwise describe that remote target photo. This procedure is repeated for a number of different targets. Many ways of analytically evaluating the results of this sort of experiment have been developed. One common method is to take the group of seven target photos and responses, randomly shuffle the targets and responses, and then ask independent judges to rank or match the correct targets with the participant&#39;s actual responses. This method assumes that if there were an anomalous transfer of information, the responses should correspond more closely to the correct targets than to the mismatched targets.<sup id="_ref-Dunne_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dunne" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several hundred such trials have been conducted by investigators over the past 25 years, including by the <a href="/wiki/Princeton_Engineering_Anomalies_Research_Laboratory" id="w">Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory</a> (PEAR) and by scientists at <a href="/wiki/SRI_International" id="w">SRI International</a> and <a href="/wiki/Science_Applications_International_Corporation" id="w">SAIC</a>, under contract by the <a href="/wiki/U.S._government" id="w">U.S. government</a>.

<p>The advent of powerful and inexpensive electronic and computer technologies has allowed the development of fully automated experiments studying possible interactions between <a href="/wiki/Mind_and_matter" id="w">mind and matter</a>. In the most common experiment of this type, a <a href="/wiki/Random_number_generator" id="w">random number generator</a> (RNG), based on electronic or <a href="/wiki/Radioactive" id="w">radioactive</a> noise, produces a data stream that is recorded and analyzed by computer <a href="/wiki/Software" id="w">software</a>. A subject attempts to mentally alter the distribution of the random numbers, usually in an experimental design that is functionally equivalent to getting more &#34;heads&#34; than &#34;tails&#34; while flipping a coin. In the RNG experiment, design flexibility can be combined with rigorous controls, while collecting a large amount of data in very short period of time. This technique has been used both to test individuals for psychokinesis and to test the possible influence on RNGs of large groups of people.<sup id="_ref-Dunne85_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dunne85" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Major meta-analyses of the RNG database have been published every few years since appearing in the journal <i><a href="/wiki/Foundations_of_Physics" id="w">Foundations of Physics</a></i> in 1986.<sup id="_ref-Dunne85_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dunne85" title="">[22]</a></sup> PEAR founder <a href="/wiki/Robert_G._Jahn" id="w">Robert G.

The most recent <a href="/wiki/Meta-analysis" id="w">meta-analysis</a> was published in <i><a href="/wiki/Psychological_Bulletin" id="w">Psychological Bulletin</a></i>, along with several critical commentaries.<sup id="_ref-pmid16822162_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pmid16822162" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-pmid16822164_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pmid16822164" title="">[24]</a></sup>  The meta-analysis was composed of 380 studies, which some researchers say has produced an overall effect size that was very small but statistically significant.</p>
<a id="Direct_mental_interactions_with_living_systems" name="Direct_mental_interactions_with_living_systems"></a><h4>Direct mental interactions with living systems</h4>
<p>Formerly called bio-PK, &#34;direct mental interactions with living systems&#34; (DMILS) studies the effects of one person&#39;s intentions on a distant person&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Psychophysiological" id="w">psychophysiological</a> state. One type of DMILS experiment looks at the commonly reported &#34;feeling of being stared at.&#34; The &#34;starer&#34; and the &#34;staree&#34; are isolated in different locations, and the starer is periodically asked to simply gaze at the staree via closed circuit video links. Meanwhile, the staree&#39;s nervous system activity is automatically and continuously monitored. </p>
<p>Parapsychologists have interpreted the cumulative data on this and similar DMILS experiments to suggest that one person&#39;s attention directed towards a remote, isolated person can significantly activate or calm that person&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Nervous_system" id="w">nervous system</a>. In a meta-analysis of these experiments published in the <i>British Journal of Psychology</i> in 2004, researchers found that there was a small but significant overall DMILS effect.  However, the study also found that when a small number of the highest-quality studies from one laboratory were analyzed, the effect size was not significant. The authors concluded that although the existence of some anomaly related to distant intentions cannot be ruled out, there was also a shortage of independent replications and theoretical concepts.<sup id="_ref-pmid15142304_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pmid15142304" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<p>A <a href="/wiki/Near-death_experience" id="w">near-death experience</a> (NDE) is an experience reported by a person who nearly died, or who experienced <a href="/wiki/Clinical_death" id="w">clinical death</a> and then revived.  NDEs include one or more of the following experiences: a sense of being dead; an <a href="/wiki/Out-of-body_experience" id="w">out-of-body experience</a>; a sensation of floating above one&#39;s body and seeing the surrounding area; a sense of overwhelming love and peace; a sensation of moving upwards through a tunnel or narrow passageway; meeting deceased relatives or spiritual figures; encountering a being of light, or a light; experiencing a <a href="/wiki/Life_review" id="w">life review</a>; reaching a border or boundary; and a feeling of being returned to the body, often accompanied by reluctance.<sup id="_ref-Mauro_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mauro" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Interest in the NDE was originally spurred by the research of psychiatrists <a href="/wiki/Elisabeth_K%C3%BCbler-Ross" id="w">Elisabeth Kübler-Ross</a>, George Ritchie, and <a href="/wiki/Raymond_Moody" id="w"> Raymond Moody Jr</a>. In 1998, Moody was appointed chair in &#34;consciousness studies&#34; at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Nevada%2C_Las_Vegas" id="w">University of Nevada, Las Vegas</a>.  The <a href="/wiki/International_Association_for_Near-death_Studies" id="w">International Association for Near-death Studies</a> (IANDS) was founded in 1978 to meet the needs of early researchers and experiencers within this field of research.  Later researchers, such as psychiatrist <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Greyson" id="w">Bruce Greyson</a>, psychologist <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Ring" id="w">Kenneth Ring</a>, and cardiologist Michael Sabom, introduced the study of near-death experiences to the academic setting.<sup id="_ref-Mauro_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mauro" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>

<p>There have been instances of <a href="/wiki/Fraud" id="w">fraud</a> in the history of parapsychology research. The Soal-Goldney experiments of 1941&#8211;43 (suggesting precognitive ability in subjects) were long regarded as some of the best in the field because they relied upon independent checking and witnesses to prevent fraud. However, many years later, suspicions of fraud were confirmed when statistical evidence, uncovered and published by other parapsychologists in the field, indicated that Dr. Soal had cheated by altering the raw data.<sup id="_ref-Alcock81_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alcock81" title="">[31]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Haskell_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haskell" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Marwick_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marwick" title="">[34]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Walter J. Levy, director of the Institute for Parapsychology, reported on a series of successful ESP experiments involving computer-controlled manipulation of non-human subjects, including eggs and rats. His experiments showed very high positive results. Because the subjects were non-human, and because the experimental environment was mostly automated, his successful experiments avoided criticism concerning experimenter effects, and removed the question of the subject&#39;s belief as an influence on the outcome. However, Levy&#39;s fellow researchers became suspicious about his methods. They found that Levy interfered with data-recording equipment, manually creating fraudulent strings of positive results. Rhine fired Levy and reported the fraud in a number of articles.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>

<p>Because <a href="/wiki/Psi" id="w">psi</a> is a negatively defined concept, a typical measure of the evidence for such phenomena in parapsychological experiments is statistical deviation from chance expectation. However, critics point out that statistical deviation from chance is, strictly speaking, only evidence of a statistical anomaly, or that some unknown variable was causing the deviation from chance. Hyman contends that even if experiments could be made to reproduce the findings of certain parapsychological studies under specific conditions, this would be a far cry from concluding that psychic functioning has been demonstrated.<sup id="_ref-Hyman33_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hyman33" title="">[47]</a></sup> It has also been stated that assuming psi exists is <a href="/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent" id="w">affirming the consequent</a> or <a href="/wiki/Begging_the_question" id="w">begging the question</a>.
