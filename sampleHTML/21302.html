<p><b>Nauru</b> ({{pronEng}}), officially the <b>Republic of Nauru</b>, is an <a href="/wiki/Island_nation" id="w">island nation</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Micronesia" id="w">Micronesian</a> <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">South Pacific</a>. The nearest neighbour is <a href="/wiki/Banaba_Island" id="w">Banaba Island</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Kiribati" id="w">Republic of Kiribati</a>, 300 km due east. Nauru is the world&#39;s smallest island nation, covering just 21&#160;<a href="/wiki/Square_kilometre" id="w">km²</a> (8.1&#160;<a href="/wiki/Square_mile" id="w">sq.&#160;mi</a>), the smallest independent <a href="/wiki/Republic" id="w">republic</a>, and the only republican state in the world without an official <a href="/wiki/Capital" id="w">capital</a>.<sup id="_ref-CIA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CIA" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Initially inhabited by <a href="/wiki/Micronesia" id="w">Micronesian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polynesia" id="w">Polynesian</a> peoples, Nauru was <a href="/wiki/Annex" id="w">annexed</a> and designated a &#39;<a href="/wiki/Colony" id="w">colony</a>&#39; by <a href="/wiki/German_Empire" id="w">Germany</a> in the late 19th century, and became a <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" id="w">mandate territory</a> administered by <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> following <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Island" id="w">island</a> was occupied by <a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" id="w">Japan</a> during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, and after the war entered into trusteeship again. Nauru achieved independence in 1968.</p>
<p>Nauru is a <a href="/wiki/Phosphate_rock" id="w">phosphate rock</a> <a href="/wiki/Island" id="w">island</a>, and its primary economic activity since 1907 has been the export of phosphate mined from the island.<sup id="_ref-UN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UN" title="">[2]</a></sup> With the exhaustion of phosphate reserves, its environment severely degraded by mining, and the trust established to manage the island&#39;s wealth significantly reduced in value, the government of Nauru has resorted to unusual measures to obtain income. In the 1990s, Nauru briefly became a <a href="/wiki/Tax_haven" id="w">tax haven</a> and <a href="/wiki/Money_laundering" id="w">money laundering</a> center. Since 2001, it has accepted aid from the Australian government; in exchange for this aid, Nauru houses an offshore <a href="/wiki/Nauru_detention_centre" id="w">detention centre</a> that holds and processes <a href="/wiki/Right_of_asylum" id="w">asylum seekers</a> trying to enter <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>.  </p>

Nauru was first settled by Micronesian and Polynesian peoples at least 3,000 years ago.<sup id="_ref-UNCCD_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UNCCD" title="">[3]</a></sup> There were traditionally 12 clans or tribes on Nauru, which are represented in the 12-pointed star in the nation&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Nauru" id="w">flag</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Nauruan_people" id="w">Nauruan people</a> called their island &#34;Naoero&#34;; the word &#34;Nauru&#34; was later created from &#34;Naoero&#34; so that <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> speakers could easily pronounce the name. Nauruans traced their descent on the <a href="/wiki/Matrilineal" id="w">female side</a>. Naurans subsisted on <a href="/wiki/Coconut" id="w">coconut</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pandanus_tectorius" id="w">pandanus fruit</a>, and caught juvenile <a href="/wiki/Milkfish" id="w">&#39;&#39;ibija&#39;&#39; fish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Acclimatization" id="w">acclimated</a> them to fresh water conditions and raised them in <a href="/wiki/Buada_Lagoon" id="w">Buada Lagoon</a>, providing an additional reliable source of food.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>British Captain <a href="/wiki/John_Fearn" id="w">John Fearn</a>, a whale hunter, became the first Westerner to visit the island in 1798, and named it Pleasant Island. From around the 1830s, Nauruans had contact with Europeans from whaling ships and traders who replenished their supplies at the island. Around this time, beachcombers and deserters began to live on the island. The islanders traded food for alcoholic <a href="/wiki/Palm_wine" id="w">toddy</a> and firearms; the firearms were used during the 10-year <a href="/wiki/Nauruan_Tribal_War" id="w">war</a> which began in 1878 and resulted in a reduction of the population from 1400 to 900 persons. The island was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Islands" id="w">Marshall Islands</a> Protectorate; they called the island Nawodo or Onawero. The arrival of the Germans ended the war; social changes brought about by the war established Kings as rulers of the island, the most widely known being King <a href="/wiki/Auweyida" id="w">Auweyida</a>. Christian missionaries from the <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_Islands" id="w">Gilbert Islands</a> also arrived at the island in 1888.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Phosphate was discovered on the island in 1900 by prospector <a href="/wiki/Albert_Fuller_Ellis" id="w">Albert Ellis</a> and the Pacific Phosphate Company started to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany; they exported their first shipment in 1907.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Following the outbreak of World War I, the island was captured by Australian forces in 1914. After the war, the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" id="w">League of Nations</a> gave the UK a trustee mandate over the territory, which it agreed to share with Australia and New Zealand in 1923.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> The three governments signed a Nauru Island Agreement in 1919, creating a board known as the <a href="/wiki/British_Phosphate_Commission" id="w">British Phosphate Commission</a> (BPC), which took over the rights to phosphate mining.

<a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> forces occupied the island on <a href="/wiki/August_26" id="w">August 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The Japanese-built airfield on the island was bombed in March 1943, preventing food supplies from reaching the island. The Japanese deported 1,200 Nauruans to work as labourers in the <a href="/wiki/Chuuk" id="w">Chuuk islands</a>, where 463 died.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> The island was liberated on <a href="/wiki/September_13" id="w">September 13</a> <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a> when the Australian warship <a href="/wiki/HMAS_Diamantina_(K377)" id="w">HMAS &#39;&#39;Diamantina&#39;&#39;</a> approached the island and Japanese forces surrendered. Arrangements were made by the BPC to repatriate Nauruans from Chuuk, and they were returned to Nauru by the BPC ship <i>Trienza</i> in January 1946.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> In 1947, a trusteeship was approved by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a>, and Australia, NZ and the UK again became trustees of the island. Nauru became self-governing in January 1966, and following a two-year constitutional convention, became independent in 1968, led by founding president <a href="/wiki/Hammer_DeRoburt" id="w">Hammer DeRoburt</a>. In 1967, the people of Nauru purchased the assets of the British Phosphate Commissioners, and in June 1970, control passed to the locally owned <a href="/wiki/Nauru_Phosphate_Corporation" id="w">Nauru Phosphate Corporation</a>. Income from the exploitation of phosphate gave Nauruans one of the highest living standards in the Pacific.</p>
<p>In 1989, the country took legal action against Australia in the <a href="/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice" id="w">International Court of Justice</a> over Australia&#39;s actions during its administration of Nauru, in particular, Australia&#39;s failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The action led to an out-of-court settlement to rehabilitate the mined-out areas of Nauru. Diminishing phosphate reserves has led to economic decline in Nauru, which has brought increasing political instability since the mid-1980s. Nauru had 17 changes of administration between 1989 and 2003.<sup id="_ref-DFAT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DFAT" title="">[12]</a></sup> Between 1999 and 2003, a series of no-confidence votes and elections resulted in two people, <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Harris" id="w">René Harris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Dowiyogo" id="w">Bernard Dowiyogo</a>, leading the country for alternating periods. Dowiyogo died in office in March 2003 and <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_Scotty" id="w">Ludwig Scotty</a> was elected President. Scotty was re-elected to serve a full term in October 2004. </p>
<p>In recent times, a significant proportion of the country&#39;s income has come in the form of aid from Australia. In 2001, the <i><a href="/wiki/MV_Tampa" id="w">MV Tampa</a></i>, a <a href="/wiki/Norway" id="w">Norwegian</a> ship which had rescued 433 <a class="externallink" href="http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=130456" rel="nofollow" title="http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=130456">http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=130456</a> refugees (from various countries including <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" id="w">Afghanistan</a>) from a stranded 20-metre (65&#160;<a href="/wiki/Foot_(unit_of_length)" id="w">ft</a>) boat and was seeking to dock in Australia, was diverted to Nauru as part of the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Solution" id="w">Pacific Solution</a>. Nauru continues to operate the Nauru detention centre in exchange for Australian aid.

Nauru is a <a href="/wiki/Republic" id="w">republic</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_system" id="w">parliamentary system</a> of government. The president is both the <a href="/wiki/Head_of_state" id="w">head of state</a> and of <a href="/wiki/Head_of_government" id="w">government</a>. An 18-member <a href="/wiki/Unicameral" id="w">unicameral</a> parliament is elected every three years. The parliament elects a president from its members, who appoints a cabinet of five to six members. Nauru does not have a formal structure for political parties; candidates typically stand as independents. 15 of the 18 members of the current parliament are independents, and alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties.<sup id="_ref-DFAT_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DFAT" title="">[12]</a></sup> Three parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Nauru" id="w">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nauru_First" id="w">Nauru First</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Centre_Party_(Nauru)" id="w">Centre Party</a>.

<p>Since 1992, local government has been the responsibility of the Nauru Island Council (NIC). The NIC has limited powers and functions as an advisor to the national government on local matters. The role of the NIC is to concentrate its efforts on local activities relevant to Nauruans. An elected member of the Nauru Island Council cannot simultaneously be a member of parliament.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Land_tenure" id="w">Land tenure</a> in Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, which is owned by individuals and family groups; government and corporate entities do not own land and must enter into a lease arrangement with the landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own lands.<sup id="_ref-UNCCD_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UNCCD" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nauru has a complex legal system. The Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice, is paramount on <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Nauru" id="w">constitutional issues</a>. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions, but Appellate Court rulings can be appealed to the <a href="/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" id="w">High Court of Australia</a>;<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> in practice, this rarely happens. Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. Finally, there also are two quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.<sup id="_ref-State Department_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-State Department" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nauru has no armed forces; under an informal agreement, defence is the responsibility of Australia. There is a small police force under civilian control.<sup id="_ref-CIA_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CIA" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

The US <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_Radiation_Measurement" id="w">Atmospheric Radiation Measurement</a> Program operates a climate-monitoring facility on the island.</p>
<p>Nauru and Australia have close diplomatic ties. In addition to informal defence arrangements, the September 2005 Memorandum of Understanding between the two countries provides Nauru with financial aid and technical assistance, including a Secretary of Finance to prepare Nauru&#39;s budget, and advisers on health and education. This aid is in return for Nauru&#39;s housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed.<sup id="_ref-DFAT_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DFAT" title="">[12]</a></sup> Nauru uses the <a href="/wiki/Australian_dollar" id="w">Australian dollar</a> as its official currency.</p>

Nauru is a small, oval-shaped island in the western Pacific Ocean, 42 km (26 mi.) south of the <a href="/wiki/Equator" id="w">Equator</a>. It is about one-tenth the size of <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_DC" id="w">Washington, DC</a>. The island is surrounded by a coral reef, exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles. The reef is bound seaward by deep water, and inside by a sandy beach. The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a <a href="/wiki/Seaport" id="w">seaport</a>, although sixteen artificial <a href="/wiki/Canals_in_Nauru" id="w">canals</a> have been made in the reef to allow small boats to access the island. A 150&#8211;300 m (about 500&#8211;1000 ft.) wide fertile coastal strip lies landward from the beach. Coral cliffs surround the central plateau, which is known on the island as Topside. The highest point of the plateau is 65 m (213 ft) above sea level. The only fertile areas are the narrow coastal belt, where <a href="/wiki/Coconut_palm" id="w">coconut palms</a> flourish. The land surrounding <a href="/wiki/Buada_Lagoon" id="w">Buada Lagoon</a> supports <a href="/wiki/Banana" id="w">bananas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pineapple" id="w">pineapples</a>; vegetable,  <a href="/wiki/Pandanus_tectorius" id="w">pandanus trees</a> and indigenous hardwoods such as the <a href="/wiki/Calophyllum_inophyllum" id="w">tomano tree</a> are cultivated.

Nauru was one of three great <a href="/wiki/Guano" id="w">phosphate rock</a> islands in the Pacific Ocean (the others are Banaba (Ocean Island) in <a href="/wiki/Kiribati" id="w">Kiribati</a> and Makatea in <a href="/wiki/French_Polynesia" id="w">French Polynesia</a>); however, the phosphate reserves are nearly depleted. Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to 15 m (49 ft) high. A century of mining has stripped and devastated four-fifths of the land area. Mining has also had an impact on the surrounding <a href="/wiki/Exclusive_Economic_Zone" id="w">Exclusive Economic Zone</a> with 40% of marine life considered to have been killed by silt and phosphate run off.<sup id="_ref-climate_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-climate" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are limited natural fresh water resources on Nauru. Roof <a href="/wiki/Rainwater_tank" id="w">storage tanks</a> collect rainwater, but islanders are mostly dependent on a single, aging <a href="/wiki/Desalination" id="w">desalination plant</a>. Nauru&#39;s climate is hot and extremely humid year-round, because of the proximity of the land to the <a href="/wiki/Equator" id="w">Equator</a> and the ocean. The island is affected by <a href="/wiki/Monsoon" id="w">monsoonal</a> rains between November and February. Annual rainfall is highly variable and influenced by the <a href="/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o-Southern_Oscillation" id="w">El Niño-Southern Oscillation</a>, with several recorded droughts.<sup id="_ref-UNCCD_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UNCCD" title="">[3]</a></sup> The temperature ranges between 26 and 35&#160;°C (79 and 95&#160;°F) during the day and between 25 and 28&#160;°C (77 and 82&#160;°F) at night. As an island nation, Nauru may be vulnerable to <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" id="w">climate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sea_level_rise" id="w">sea level change</a>, but to what degree is difficult to predict; at least 80% of the land area of Nauru is well elevated, but this area will be uninhabitable until the phosphate mining rehabilitation program is implemented.<sup id="_ref-climate_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-climate" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are only sixty recorded <a href="/wiki/Vascular_plant" id="w">vascular plant</a> species native to the island, none of which are <a href="/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)" id="w">endemic</a>. Coconut farming, mining and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation.<sup id="_ref-UNCCD_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UNCCD" title="">[3]</a></sup> There are no native land mammals; there are native birds, including the endemic <a href="/wiki/Nauru_Reed_Warbler" id="w">Nauru Reed Warbler</a>, insects and land crabs. The <a href="/wiki/Polynesian_Rat" id="w">Polynesian Rat</a>, cats, dogs, pigs and chickens have been introduced to the island.</p>

Nauru&#39;s economy depends almost entirely on declining phosphate deposits from <a href="/wiki/Guano" id="w">guano</a>; there are few other resources, and most necessities are imported.<sup id="_ref-Mining_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mining" title="">[20]</a></sup> Small-scale mining is still conducted by the NPC. The government places a percentage of the NPC&#39;s earnings in the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. The Trust manages long-term investments, intended to support the citizens once the phosphate reserves have been exhausted. However, a history of bad investments, financial mismanagement, overspending and corruption has reduced the Trust&#39;s fixed and current assets. For example, <a href="/wiki/Nauru_House" id="w">Nauru House</a> in <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" id="w">Melbourne</a> was sold in 2004 to finance debts and <a href="/wiki/Air_Nauru" id="w">Air Nauru&#39;s</a> only <a href="/wiki/Boeing_737" id="w">Boeing 737-400</a> was repossessed in December 2005 - though the aircraft was replaced in June of the next year with a <a href="/wiki/Boeing_737" id="w">Boeing 737-300</a> model, and normal service was resumed by the company.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> The value of the Trust is estimated to have shrunk from <a href="/wiki/Australian_dollar" id="w">A$1</a>,300 million in 1991 to A$138 million in 2002.<sup id="_ref-ADB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ADB" title="">[23]</a></sup> Nauru currently lacks money to perform many of the basic functions of government, the national Bank of Nauru is insolvent, and GDP per capita has fallen to US$5,000 per annum.  In the early 1980&#39;s Nauru had the highest GDP per capita in the world.</p>
<p>There are no personal taxes in Nauru, and the government employs 95% of those Nauruans who work; unemployment is estimated to be 90%.<sup id="_ref-Economist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Economist" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CIA_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CIA" title="">[1]</a></sup> The Asian Development Bank notes that although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms, in the absence of an alternative to phosphate mining, the medium-term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance.<sup id="_ref-ADB_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ADB" title="">[23]</a></sup> The sale of deep-sea fishing rights may generate some revenue. Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy, because there are few facilities for tourists; the <a href="/wiki/Menen_Hotel" id="w">Menen Hotel</a> and <a href="/wiki/OD-N-Aiwo_Hotel" id="w">OD-N-Aiwo Hotel</a> are the only hotels on the island.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Nauru became a <a href="/wiki/Tax_haven" id="w">tax haven</a> and offered passports to foreign nationals for a fee. The inter-governmental <a href="/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_on_Money_Laundering" id="w">Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF)</a> then identified Nauru as one of 15 &#34;non-cooperative&#34; countries in its fight against <a href="/wiki/Money_laundering" id="w">money laundering</a>. Under pressure from FATF, Nauru introduced anti-avoidance legislation in 2003, following which foreign <a href="/wiki/Hot_money" id="w">hot money</a> flowed out of the country. In October 2005, this legislation—and its effective enforcement—led the FATF to lift the non-cooperative designation.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

Nauruans descended from Polynesian and Micronesian seafarers who <a href="/wiki/Nauruan_indigenous_religion" id="w">believed</a> in a female deity, Eijebong, and a spirit land, an island called Buitani. Two of the 12 original tribal groups became extinct in the 20th century. <a href="/wiki/Angam_Day" id="w">Angam Day</a>, held on <a href="/wiki/October_26" id="w">October 26</a>, celebrates the recovery of the Nauruan population after the two world wars, which together reduced the indigenous population to fewer than 1500. The displacement of the indigenous culture by colonial and contemporary, western influences is palpable. Few of the old customs have been preserved, but some forms of traditional music, arts and crafts, and fishing are still practised.
