<b>William Alfred Brown</b> (born <a href="/wiki/July_31" id="w">July 31</a> <a href="/wiki/1912" id="w">1912</a>) is a former  <a href="/wiki/Australian" id="w">Australian</a> <a href="/wiki/Test_cricket" id="w">Test cricketer</a> who played 22 Tests between <a href="/wiki/1934" id="w">1934</a> and <a href="/wiki/1948" id="w">1948</a>. Brown captained Australia in one Test in March 1946, against <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team" id="w">New Zealand</a> in a match retrospectively awarded Test status. A right-handed opening batsman who along with <a href="/wiki/Jack_Fingleton" id="w">Jack Fingleton</a> formed an opening pair in the 1930s regarded as one of the finest in Test history, Brown was a member of <a href="/wiki/Don_Bradman" id="w">Don Bradman</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_England_in_1948" id="w">&#39;&#39;Invincibles&#39;&#39;</a> that toured England in 1948 without suffering a defeat. Due to the presence of <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Morris" id="w">Arthur Morris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sid_Barnes" id="w">Sid Barnes</a> as the preferred openers, Brown only played in two of the five Tests, batting out of position in the middle order. Brown was also notable for being the player to be &#34;<a href="/wiki/Vinoo_Mankad" id="w">Mankaded</a>&#34; &#8211; In a match in 1947&#8211;48, Brown had backed up too far and left his crease before the bowler, <a href="/wiki/Indian_cricket_team" id="w">India</a>&#39;s Vinoo Mankad delivered the ball. Mankad promptly removed the bails with Brown out of his ground.</p>
<p>Raised in <a href="/wiki/New_South_Wales" id="w">New South Wales</a>, Brown initially trained as a <a href="/wiki/Wicket-keeper" id="w">wicket-keeper</a> as a youth, before turning his attention to opening the batting. After struggling in both work and cricket at the start of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">Great Depression</a>, Brown gradually progressed in the early 1930s, making his first-class debut for <a href="/wiki/New_South_Wales_Blues" id="w">New South Wales</a> in 1932&#8211;33. A strong second <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Shield" id="w">Sheffield Shield</a> season in 1933&#8211;34 saw Brown selected as a reserve opener for the <a href="/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_England_in_1934" id="w">1934 tour of England</a>. Steady performances saw Brown force his way into the Test team during the tour, batting at No. 3. With the retirement of regular openers <a href="/wiki/Bill_Ponsford" id="w">Bill Ponsford</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bill_Woodfull" id="w">Bill Woodfull</a> at the end of the tour, Brown and his state opening partner <a href="/wiki/Jack_Fingleton" id="w">Jack Fingleton</a> became Australia&#39;s opening pair. They regular allowed Australia to make strong starts during the 1936&#8211;37 tour of <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a>, which Australia won 4&#8211;0. Brown relocated to <a href="/wiki/Queensland_Bulls" id="w">Queensland</a> in 1936, and the consecutive unproductive seasons blighted by injury and poor form made his selection in the <a href="/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_England_in_1938" id="w">1938 tour of England</a> the centre of debate. Brown responded with 1854 runs on tour, and was recognised as one of the five <a href="/wiki/Wisden_Cricketers_of_the_Year" id="w">Wisden Cricketers of the Year</a> in 1939. The highlight of his tour was an unbeaten 206 in the Second Test at <a href="/wiki/Lord" id="w">Lord</a>&#39;s, carrying his bat at the home of cricket, to save Australia from defeat.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a> cost Brown his peak years, as first-class cricket was cancelled and he enlisted in the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" id="w">Royal Australian Air Force</a>. After the end of the war, cricket resumed in 1945&#8211;46 and Brown captained an Australian team to <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a>, leading the team in a retrospectively accredited Test match in the absence of <a href="/wiki/Don_Bradman" id="w">Don Bradman</a>. The following season, Brown was absent from first-class cricket with a wrist injury. Upon returning in 1947&#8211;48 Brown was unable to perform to his previous standards and was dropped in favour of <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Morris" id="w">Arthur Morris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sid_Barnes" id="w">Sid Barnes</a>, who had become the preferred openers. Brown was selected for Bradman&#39;s <i>Invincibles</i> tour of England, where he performed well in the first-class matches as the fourth highest runscorer. With Morris and Barnes entrenched as openers, however, Brown was forced to bat out of position in the middle order during the first two Tests. He struggled and was dropped from the Test team. Upon returning to Australia, Brown continued playing for Queensland until the end of the 1949&#8211;50 season. In retirement, Brown briefly served as a Test selector. In <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a>, Brown was awarded the Medal of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_Australia" id="w">Order of Australia</a> for his services to cricket and he is currently Australia&#39;s oldest living Test cricketer.</p>

An innings of 172 for his Shire team reinvigorated him, progressing through the grades until he reached his first XI, where steady performances saw him selected in 1932&#8211;33 he appeared for <a href="/wiki/New_South_Wales_Blues" id="w">New South Wales</a> team.<sup id="_ref-wisden_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wisden" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

The selectors asked <a href="/wiki/Don_Bradman" id="w">Don Bradman</a>, Australia&#39;s leading batsman and state team-mate to Brown and Fingleton, for advice.

Brown was unable to pass 20 in the final two Tests and ended the series with 300 runs at 33.3.

With the retirement of Woodfull and Ponsford at the end of the tour, Brown and his state partner Fingleton became Australia’s opening pair for the 1935&#8211;36 tour of South Africa. Brown started the tour consistently with three consecutive half centuries in the first two Tests in <a href="/wiki/Durban" id="w">Durban</a> and <a href="/wiki/Johannesburg" id="w">Johannesburg</a>.<sup id="_ref-testlist_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-testlist" title="">[9]</a></sup> In the Third Test at <a href="/wiki/Cape_Town" id="w">Cape Town</a>, the pair set a new Australian opening record of 233 which laid the foundation for a large Australian total and an innings victory.<sup id="_ref-az_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-az" title="">[1]</a></sup> He posted 121, a new highest score. He scored 34 and 84 in the only Australian innings of the Fourth and Fifth Test  in Johannesburg and Durban, making solid opening partnerships with Fingleton, who scored three centuries consecutively.

<p>In 1936 Brown took a coaching position for Queensland, representing the side from 1936&#8211;37 onwards and being appointed captain the following season.

Brown&#39;s form started to deteriorate in 1937&#8211;38, scoring only 400 runs at 36.36. Although he scored two centuries, he was only twelfth in the aggregates during an Australian season with no international tours. As a result, his selection for the 1938 tour to England was criticised in some quarters.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Brown started the tour with an unbeaten 196 against <a href="/wiki/Northamptonshire_County_Cricket_Club" id="w">Northamptonshire</a>.<sup id="_ref-wisden_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wisden" title="">[2]</a></sup> He scored a century of 133 in the first Test at Nottingham after Australia were forced to follow on, helping Bradman (144*) to save the Test with a draw.<sup id="_ref-p173_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p173" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Brown&#39;s most celebrated innings came at Lord’s in the Second Test, where he scored 206 as he carried his bat. England had batted first and amassed 494, largely on the back of 240 by <a href="/wiki/Wally_Hammond" id="w">Wally Hammond</a>. Brown put on an opening stand of 69 before his partner Fingleton was dismissed.<sup id="_ref-p173_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p173" title="">[14]</a></sup> Bradman was bowled for 18 by <a href="/wiki/Hedley_Verity" id="w">Hedley Verity</a>, leaving the score at 101, before <a href="/wiki/Stan_McCabe" id="w">Stan McCabe</a> was dismissed after a quick 38 with the score at 3/152.

In the 1946&#8211;47 season, he missed the Test series against England due to a thumb injury.<sup id="_ref-az_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-az" title="">[1]</a></sup>  This allowed young New South Wales opener <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Morris" id="w">Arthur Morris</a> to make his debut. Morris’ performance in the series eventually saw Brown displaced from his position as a first-choice opening batsman.<sup id="_ref-morris_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-morris" title="">[28]</a></sup> The injury was serious enough to prevent Brown from playing a single match for Queensland.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p>Brown returned to the Test team for the 1947&#8211;48 for the Indian tour of Australia. Initially, the selectors dropped Barnes when Brown returned, pairing him with Morris.<sup id="_ref-testlist_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-testlist" title="">[9]</a></sup> Apart from the two Tests that Brown had played during the 1936&#8211;37 season against England, Brown had not played Test cricket on Australian soil.<sup id="_ref-testlist_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-testlist" title="">[9]</a></sup> He only had one opportunity in the First Test in Brisbane, making 11 as India fell to an innings defeat.<sup id="_ref-testlist_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-testlist" title="">[9]</a></sup> Brown&#39;s participation in the series was overshadowed when he was controversially <a href="/wiki/Run_out" id="w">run out</a> by Indian <a href="/wiki/Left_arm_orthodox_spin" id="w">left arm orthodox spinner</a> <a href="/wiki/Vinoo_Mankad" id="w">Vinoo Mankad</a> in the Second Test at the <a href="/wiki/Sydney_Cricket_Ground" id="w">Sydney Cricket Ground</a> for 18. Brown was run out by Mankad when, in the act of delivering the ball, Mankad held on to it and whipped the bails off at the non-striker’s end with Brown well out of his crease while he was backing-up the striker. This was the second time Mankad had dismissed Brown in this fashion on this tour &#8211; he had done it in an earlier match against an Australian XI. On that occasion Mankad had warned Brown once before running him out. The Australian press strongly accused Mankad of being unsportsmanlike, though some Australians, including <a href="/wiki/Don_Bradman" id="w">Don Bradman</a> defended Mankad&#39;s actions. After this incident, if a batsman is given out this way, he is said to have been &#34;Mankaded&#34;.<sup id="_ref-p176_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p176" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>The dismissal saw another low scoring innings and Brown was dropped from the team in favour of Barnes for the next two Tests.<sup id="_ref-p176_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p176" title="">[17]</a></sup> Morris, who had established himself as one of Australia’s first-choice opening batsmen during Brown’s injury layoff during the previous season, was rested for the Fifth Test as the Australian Board trialled potential candidates for the upcoming tour of England in 1948.<sup id="_ref-morris_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-morris" title="">[28]</a></sup> Brown was recalled to partner Barnes and made 99 in the first innings, before being run out.<sup id="_ref-p176_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p176" title="">[17]</a></sup> India fell to another innings defeat so Brown did not have another opportunity to score a Test century on home soil. His Test aggregate in Australia stood at 223 runs at only 33.86 in contrast to his away average of 1369 runs at 50.70.<sup id="_ref-testlist_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-testlist" title="">[9]</a></sup> His first-class batting average of 43.58 for the season was inferior to that of his competitors for the opening positions Barnes and Morris, both of whom averaged in excess of 50.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

In any case, Brown had done enough to be chosen to tour England with the &#34;Invincibles&#34; in 1948.<sup id="_ref-az_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-az" title="">[1]</a></sup> He played in the first two Tests in the middle order as Barnes and Morris were the preferred openers, before losing his place to <a href="/wiki/Sam_Loxton" id="w">Sam Loxton</a> for the Third Test.<sup id="_ref-p176_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p176" title="">[17]</a></sup> His final Test was in the Second Test at Lord’s, where he was unable to replicate the centuries he made in the preceding tours, making 24 and 32.<sup id="_ref-testlist_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-testlist" title="">[9]</a></sup> Barnes was injured in the Third Test, but Brown was not recalled for the Fourth Test; instead, <a href="/wiki/Lindsay_Hassett" id="w">Lindsay Hassett</a> was promoted to partner Morris as a makeshift opener, and the teenaged Neil Harvey came into the middle-order and struck 112.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Brown performed strongly in the county matches with eight centuries made a total of 1448 runs on the tour, behind only Bradman, Hassett and Morris with a best score of 200 against <a href="/wiki/Cambridge_University" id="w">Cambridge University</a>.<sup id="_ref-az_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-az" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-old_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-old" title="">[16]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Upon returning to Australia, Bradman retired and Barnes took a break from cricket, thereby opening two vacancies in the Test team. Barnes had a reasonable domestic season in 1948&#8211;1949 in his quest to press his claim for a Test recall, scoring 626 runs at 41.73, the sixth highest aggregate of the season.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Despite this, Brown was not named in the touring party at the age of 37 for the Test tour of <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a> in 1949&#8211;50. In the absence of the Test players, Brown scored 507 runs at 50.70 in the Sheffield Shield season, with a top score of 190, making him the third highest run-getter.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> With his opportunities diminishing, he retired at the end of the season after captaining the Australian second team to New Zealand.<sup id="_ref-az_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-az" title="">[1]</a></sup> He had been less effective in his later years, averaging 38.29 in Test cricket following the resumption after the Second World War.<sup id="_ref-testlist_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-testlist" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

In addition to his batting, Brown was a highly regarded fieldsman. He developed his skills with persistent training with professional sprinters in order to learn anticipation and quickness off the mark. Brown was regarded as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes. He was known for his trademnark leg glancing and placement of the ball.<sup id="_ref-az_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-az" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-wisden_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wisden" title="">[2]</a></sup> Johnnie Moyes said that &#34;even when slow, he never wearied, as some do, because his style was cultured and free from jarring faults.&#34;<sup id="_ref-p177_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p177" title="">[35]</a></sup> Moyes felt that Brown’s superior performance on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful. Moyes felt that the more serene gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hurrying himself to placate impatient spectators. &#34;A placid chap was Brown, and he liked to play in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic.&#34;<sup id="_ref-p175_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p175" title="">[4]</a></sup> His partnership with Fingleton was regarded as one of the great opening pairings in the history of the Test cricket.<sup id="_ref-old_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-old" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Off_the_field" name="Off_the_field"></a><h1> Off the field </h1>
<p>In 1940, Brown married Barbara Hart, a <a href="/wiki/Receptionist" id="w">receptionist</a>.<sup id="_ref-p176_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p176" title="">[17]</a></sup> Brown was a Queensland selector from 1950&#8211;51 to 1959&#8211;60 and an Australian selector in 1952&#8211;53. His brief tenure as a national selector was marked by abuse and harassment from parochial Queenslanders who were upset that he did not include his fellow statesmen in the Test team.<sup id="_ref-p177_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p177" title="">[35]</a></sup> In 1992 the <a href="/wiki/Queensland_Cricket_Association" id="w">Queensland Cricket Association</a> elected him a life member.<sup id="_ref-az_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-az" title="">[1]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a> Brown was awarded the Medal of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_Australia" id="w">Order of Australia</a> for his services to cricket, and he is currently Australia&#39;s oldest living Test cricketer.<sup id="_ref-profile_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-profile" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
