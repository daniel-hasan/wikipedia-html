<p><b>Berkley Warren Bedell</b> (born <a href="/wiki/March_5" id="w">March 5</a> <a href="/wiki/1921" id="w">1921</a>) is a former <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">U.S. Representative</a> from <a href="/wiki/Iowa" id="w">Iowa</a>. After starting a successful business in his youth, he ran for the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" id="w">United States Congress</a> in 1972, but was defeated by incumbent <a href="/wiki/Wiley_Mayne" id="w">Wiley Mayne</a>.<sup id="_ref-mayne_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mayne" title="">[1]</a></sup> In 1974, however, Bedell beat Wiley Mayne and was elected to Congress.</p>
<p>He was known for his support of <a href="/wiki/Representative_democracy" id="w">representative democracy</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Populism" id="w">populist</a> style. For example, he would hold town halls and let constituents vote on motions to decide what he would do in Congress on their behalf.<sup id="_ref-reid_book_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reid_book" title="">[2]</a></sup> These meetings helped Bedell understand the problems of his constituents;<sup id="_ref-reid_book_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reid_book" title="">[2]</a></sup> as a result, he backed issues that were important to his farming constituency, such as waterway usage fees<sup id="_ref-reid_post_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reid_post" title="">[3]</a></sup> and production constraints.<sup id="_ref-farm_plan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-farm_plan" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>He did not seek reelection in 1986 after contracting <a href="/wiki/Lyme_disease" id="w">Lyme disease</a> from a tick bite.<sup id="_ref-tick_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tick" title="">[5]</a></sup> Though he no longer serves in Congress, Bedell remains active in Iowa politics, strongly supporting <a href="/wiki/Howard_Dean" id="w">Howard Dean</a> in <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_2004" id="w">2004</a> over <a href="/wiki/John_Kerry" id="w">John Kerry</a>.<sup id="_ref-dean_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dean" title="">[6]</a></sup> In the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_2008" id="w">2008</a> presidential election, he has not committed to endorsing anyone, though he has met several times with <a href="/wiki/Chris_Dodd" id="w">Chris Dodd</a>.<sup id="_ref-dodd_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dodd" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h1>Early life</h1>
<p>Born in <a href="/wiki/Spirit_Lake%2C_Iowa" id="w">Spirit Lake, Iowa</a>, Bedell was educated in Spirit Lake public schools. He graduated from Spirit Lake High School in 1939, where he earned spending money with a business in the midst of the Great Depression.<sup id="_ref-board_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-board" title="">[8]</a></sup> His business involved braiding dog hairs around fishhooks, the result of which could be sold as trout flies.<sup id="_ref-reid_book_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reid_book" title="">[2]</a></sup> He began tying the fly-fishing lures in his bedroom, then he moved the business into his parents&#39; basement. In time, he got space above a grocery store to continue the business full-time.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>After graduating from high school, he attended <a href="/wiki/Iowa_State_University" id="w">Iowa State University</a> from 1940 to 1942, leaving in 1942 to join the army. He served in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" id="w">United States Army</a> as first lieutenant and flight trainer from 1942 to 1945.<sup id="_ref-board_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-board" title="">[8]</a></sup> When he got back, he began to garner success from his fish tackling business. His business became larger, with hundreds of employees and international operations; he had became a millionaire by the 1960s. He served as member of the Spirit Lake Board of Education from 1957 to 1962.<sup id="_ref-board_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-board" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Political_career" name="Political_career"></a><h1>Political career</h1>
<a id="Running_for_Congress" name="Running_for_Congress"></a><h2>Running for Congress</h2>
<p>By the early 1970s, Bedell had decided to run for political office. In 1972, he ran against <a href="/wiki/Wiley_Mayne" id="w">Wiley Mayne</a>, a Republican incumbent in <a href="/wiki/Iowa%26%2339%3Bs_6th_congressional_district" id="w">Iowa&#39;s 6th congressional district</a>. Mayne was a staunch supporter of <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nixon" id="w">Richard Nixon</a> and secured victory along with the President in a year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after <a href="/wiki/Watergate" id="w">Watergate</a> (he was one of only a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President on the <a href="/wiki/House_Judiciary_Committee" id="w">judiciary committee</a>.)<sup id="_ref-mayne_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mayne" title="">[1]</a></sup> When Berkley Bedell ran against Wiley Mayne again in 1974, Bedell would defeat the incumbent.<sup id="_ref-mayne_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mayne" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>During his time at Congress, Bedell took efforts to uphold representative democracy. He held town halls regularly with his constituents, and he would let them vote on motions to decide what he would do in Congress on their behalf.<sup id="_ref-reid_book_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reid_book" title="">[2]</a></sup> This type of communication told Bedell of the types of issues affecting his farming constituency. Thus, though Bedell had not farmed in his life, he would take steps in Congress to benefit farmers.<sup id="_ref-reid_book_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reid_book" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Waterway_usage_fees" name="Waterway_usage_fees"></a><h2>Waterway usage fees</h2>
<p>Bedell sponsored several bold initiatives during his tenure in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">United States House of Representatives</a>. One initiative, which came from his constituents&#39; problems with the <a href="/wiki/Barge" id="w">barge industry</a>, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 that would require the barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain.<sup id="_ref-reid_post_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reid_post" title="">[3]</a></sup> Bedell&#39;s original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by <a href="/wiki/Pete_Domenici" id="w">Pete Domenici</a> in the Senate.<sup id="_ref-reid_book_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reid_book" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Congress eventually passed a watered-down version of the original plan put forward by Berkley Bedell and Pete Domenici. The compromise version enacted a tax on the gasoline barges used and put it into a &#34;trust&#34; for waterway projects. While other supporters of waterway usage fees, including Domenici, backed the compromise, Bedell gave a passioned plea for his colleagues to oppose it. He viewed it as lacking a crucial element of the original plan - that of <a href="/wiki/Capital_cost" id="w">capital recovery</a>. The trust was optional, and the Government could spend money on waterway projects irrespective of the trust.<sup id="_ref-reid_book_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reid_book" title="">[2]</a></sup>The compromise was eventually signed by <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" id="w">Jimmy Carter</a>. Bedell&#39;s original plan never made it through the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">House of Representatives</a>, but he continued to introduce it in succeeding sessions. It would not, however, get a floor vote in succeeding sessions.<sup id="_ref-reid_book_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reid_book" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Farming_issues" name="Farming_issues"></a><h2>Farming issues</h2>
<p>In 1985, Bedell put forward an agricultural plan that he thought would increase <a href="/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy" id="w">production controls</a> for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by <a href="/wiki/Labor_unions" id="w">labor unions</a> and certain <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democrats</a>, passed the <a href="/wiki/House_Agriculture_Committee" id="w">Agriculture Committee</a> as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would then be used to determine what types of production controls to enact. The purpose of this plan was twofold: production controls would decrease the <a href="/wiki/Aggregate_supply" id="w">aggregate supply</a> of crops, thus making individual crops cost more (which would benefit farmers, who were in the middle of an acute debt crisis.) Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls.<sup id="_ref-farm_plan_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-farm_plan" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>On the other hand, opponents of the Bedell plan had a very different view of this legislation. Senators such as <a href="/wiki/Pat_Roberts" id="w">Pat Roberts</a> claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill was an example of the politicians not doing their jobs.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell&#39;s plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Investigations_of_large_businesses" name="Investigations_of_large_businesses"></a><h2>Investigations of large businesses</h2>
<p>While in Congress, Berkley Bedell was Chairman of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Small_Business" id="w">Small Business Subcommittee</a>, and he used this position to investigate <a href="/wiki/Underselling" id="w">underselling</a> on the part of large oil companies.<sup id="_ref-investigation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-investigation" title="">[12]</a></sup> He also claimed that certain large oil companies underpaid their &#34;windfall taxes&#34; in certain cases and wanted to pass legislation to increase regulations on these corporations.<sup id="_ref-investigation_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-investigation" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In these investigations, Bedell quickly gained the support of small gasoline marketers and Senator <a href="/wiki/Bill_Nelson" id="w">Bill Nelson</a>. The chief target, <a href="/wiki/ARCO" id="w">ARCO</a>, was accused of not paying all of its taxes on <a href="/wiki/Alaska" id="w">Alaskan</a> crude oil. In the end, the government tried to make a case against ARCO, but it was eventually dropped in 1985.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Bedell used this opportunity to attack the Administration for &#34;not caring&#34; about small business owners, and he advocated that Governmental agencies put aside 1-3% of their research and development money for small businesses.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Clash_with_Reagan" name="Clash_with_Reagan"></a><h2>Clash with Reagan</h2>
<p>In late 1982, Congress passed a law which forbade the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> from funding groups aiming to overthrow the <a href="/wiki/Sandinista" id="w">Sandinista</a> government of <a href="/wiki/Nicaragua" id="w">Nicaragua</a>. Then, in 1983, Bedell visited Nicaragua and <a href="/wiki/Honduras" id="w">Honduras</a> along with Representative <a href="/wiki/Robert_G._Torricelli" id="w">Robert G. Torricelli</a>. During the trip, Bedell spoke with soldiers, generals, governmental officials and members of the <a href="/wiki/Contras" id="w">contras</a>. His conclusion at the end of the trip was that <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" id="w">Ronald Reagan</a> was aiding the <a href="/wiki/Contras" id="w">contras</a> in violation of federal law. He promised to hold hearings after returning to Congress.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Bedell would later join other House Democrats in demanding documents from the White House related to the contras, but the <a href="/wiki/Reagan_Administration" id="w">Reagan Administration</a> refused to provide them.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Bedell became angrier with the Reagan Administration as the decade wore on. He called his Central American policies &#34;sheer lunacy,&#34; saying that the mining of harbors was an acts of war.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Bedell would resign before Reagan&#39;s acts in <a href="/wiki/Central_America" id="w">Central America</a> would culminate with the <a href="/wiki/Iran-Contra_Affair" id="w">Iran-Contra Affair</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, Bedell was a sharp critic of Reagan&#39;s agricultural policies, calling for <a href="/wiki/John_Rusling_Block" id="w">John Block</a> to resign after calling his agricultural plan a failure that was &#34;dead on arrival&#34; in both the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">House</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" id="w">Senate</a>. Reagan&#39;s agricultural plan consisted primarily of a gradual reduction in farm subsidies.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> He also attacked the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" id="w">Department of Agriculture</a> for &#34;looking backward&#34; when it dismissed the only expert on <a href="/wiki/Organic_farming" id="w">organic farming</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Also, as chairman of the <a href="/wiki/House_Agriculture_Committee" id="w">subcommittee on Department Operations, Research and Foreign Agriculture</a>, which was in charge of regulating USDA operations, he opposed the proposals Reagan had for reforming the organization. The proposals generally involved shifting costs for meat inspections and other USDA duties from the <a href="/wiki/United_States_federal_government" id="w">federal government</a> to the industry.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Controversy" name="Controversy"></a><h2>Controversy</h2>
<p>In 1981, it was revealed in internal memos that Bedell may have known about potential <a href="/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement" id="w">customs violations</a> that his company engaged in. It asserted that Bedell had gone to <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" id="w">Taiwan</a> in 1973 to discuss &#34;prior violations of customs law&#34; in regards to the sale of fishing rods from the company&#39;s Taiwan subsidiary.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> Bedell responded by denying any wrongdoing, saying that he has not been personally involved in the company in years.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> In the end, no charges were levied against him, and he was reelected after the story was published.</p>
