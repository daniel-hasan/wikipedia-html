<a id="Liberal_leadership" name="Liberal_leadership"></a><h2>Liberal leadership</h2>
<p>During the election campaign, the Liberal leader was then Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Paul_Martin" id="w">Paul Martin</a>.   After the election results were announced, Liberal leader <a href="/wiki/Paul_Martin" id="w">Paul Martin</a> announced his intention to resign, but did not indicate when, other than saying he would not lead the party into the next election. On <a href="/wiki/February_1" id="w">February 1</a>, the Liberal Party Caucus chose <a href="/wiki/Bill_Graham_(politician)" id="w">Bill Graham</a> as <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_leader" id="w">parliamentary leader</a>, meaning he served as <a href="/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Canada)" id="w">Leader of the Opposition</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons" id="w">House of Commons</a> until the election of <a href="/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Dion" id="w">Stéphane Dion</a> as Liberal leader at the next Liberal Party leadership convention, held <a href="/wiki/December_2" id="w">December 2</a> through <a href="/wiki/December_3" id="w">December 3</a>.</p>
<p>Some political observers had questioned whether Martin would have led the Liberals into an election had the Harper minority fallen in the first few months of the 39th Parliament.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>  In 1979,  <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau" id="w">Pierre Trudeau</a>&#39;s Liberals lost to <a href="/wiki/Joe_Clark" id="w">Joe Clark</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada" id="w">Progressive Conservatives</a> who only won a minority on <a href="/wiki/May_22" id="w">May 22</a> of that year. The Clark minority was defeated less than seven months after on a <a href="/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence" id="w">confidence vote</a> over the budget, which was much earlier than most observers had expected the government to fall. Trudeau had announced his resignation as leader of the Liberals on <a href="/wiki/November_21" id="w">November 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1979" id="w">1979</a>; however in light of the collapse of the government on <a href="/wiki/December_13" id="w">December 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1979" id="w">1979</a>, and the Liberal Party&#39;s not having chosen a replacement as leader, Trudeau was persuaded to change his mind, and he led the party into the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1980" id="w">1980 election</a> winning a <a href="/wiki/Majority_government" id="w">majority government</a>. Unlike Martin, Trudeau did not appoint an <a href="/wiki/Interim_leader" id="w">interim leader</a> or withdraw from the day-to-day leadership of the party after announcing he would resign. </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_18" id="w">March 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> Martin officially tendered his resignation as Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> This move was widely seen as a move by Martin to stop any talk of him leading the party into the next election.</p>
<a id="Five_priorities" name="Five_priorities"></a><h2>Five priorities</h2>
<p>Prime Minister Harper has said he will move forward with his top five priorities from the campaign.  At least four of these will require legislative action: the passage of a <i><a href="/wiki/Federal_Accountability_Act" id="w">Federal Accountability Act</a></i> in response to the <a href="/wiki/Sponsorship_scandal" id="w">sponsorship scandal</a>; combating crime by creating more police officers and setting longer <a href="/wiki/Mandatory_sentencing" id="w">mandatory sentences</a>; lowering the <a href="/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(Canada)" id="w">Goods &#38; Services Tax</a> to 6% (and eventually to 5%); giving $1,200 for parents per child under the age of 6.  On <a href="/wiki/December_6" id="w">December 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, another issue many expected to arise in the first session of parliament did, in fact, come to the fore, when the government introduced a motion calling &#34;on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage without affecting civil unions and while respecting existing same-sex marriages.&#34;  The next day, the House defeated the motion by a vote of 175 to 123, with six cabinet ministers voting against it, and Harper declared the issue settled.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> (See <a href="/wiki/Members_of_the_39th_Canadian_Parliament_and_same-sex_marriage" id="w">Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage</a> for more information.)</p>
