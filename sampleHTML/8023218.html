<a id="Alchemists" name="Alchemists"></a><h2>Alchemists</h2>
<p>Alchemists are people who have learned how to manipulate the world around them. Through the use of transmutation circles, they can reform one object into something completely different. In Amestris alchemists can work for the State Military, earning them a unique title, the rank of <a href="/wiki/Major" id="w">major</a>, and funding for all of their endeavors. The people of <a href="/wiki/#Xing" id="w">Xing</a> have their own brand of alchemy focusing on healing wounds. <a href="/wiki/Scar_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Scar</a>, an <a href="/wiki/#Ishval" id="w">Ishvalan</a>, utilizes a mixture of Amestris&#39; and Xing&#39;s alchemy developed by his <a href="/wiki/#Scar&#39;s brother" id="w">brother</a>.</p>
<a id="Alex_Louis_Armstrong" name="Alex_Louis_Armstrong"></a><h3>Alex Louis Armstrong</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Alex Louis Armstrong</b>, the &#34;Strong Arm Alchemist&#34;, is a large and comically emotional State Alchemist. He will burst into tears or joyous praise given the right situation, and embraces others in an effort to console them. Because he is an extremely strong character, this usually causes others great personal injury. Armstrong is very proud of his strength, frequently taking off his shirt so that he can flex for others&#39; benefit. As a final element of his comedic properties, he has the tendency to &#34;sparkle&#34;; when first appearing in a scene or taking off his shirt, pink stars radiate from his body. Despite his humorous tendencies, Armstrong can be very serious when the situation calls for it. He is not fond of violence and will try to end conflicts peacefully, and will break down and cry if an innocent person is killed.</p>
<p>Armstrong comes from a wealthy family of aristocrats who have earned renown in most professions. He has mastered many of his family&#39;s talents for himself, and when displaying such a talent he remarks it to have been &#34;passed down the Armstrong line for generations&#34;. His alchemical skills are also a remnant of his family&#39;s history; by using a unique kind of <a href="/wiki/Brass_knuckles" id="w">brass knuckles</a>, Armstrong can reshape any solid object that he punches. In addition to projectiles and barriers for combat purposes, he can use this talent to create buildings and at times sculptures of himself. Armstrong is a valuable ally of <a href="/wiki/Roy_Mustang" id="w">Roy Mustang</a> and the Elric brothers, even if they are not always happy to be in his emotional company. He takes his honor as a soldier and as a leader seriously, and always looks out for his peers&#39; and subordinates&#39; best interests.</p>

<p><b><a href="/wiki/Alphonse_Elric" id="w">Alphonse Elric</a></b>, the younger brother of <a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Edward Elric</a>, did not become a State Alchemist at the request of his brother, though is more than capable of being one.

<a id="Edward_Elric" name="Edward_Elric"></a><h3>Edward Elric</h3>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Edward Elric</a></b>, the &#34;Fullmetal Alchemist&#34;, is the youngest State Alchemist in history and the main character of the series.

<a id="Basque_Grand" name="Basque_Grand"></a><h3>Basque Grand</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Basque Grand</b>, the &#34;Iron Blood Alchemist&#34;, earned prestige in the military for his ability to turn the iron in his blood into a large array of guns and cannons, allowing him to devastate a wide area in a short period of time. In the anime, Grand oversees the militray&#39;s creation of imperfect Philosopher&#39;s Stones as well as an army of super soldiers. Though this causes him to work against the series&#39; protagonists, the Elric brothers, Grand is actually killed by <a href="/wiki/Scar_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Scar</a>. In the manga, Grand is killed by Scar before the start of the series. Series creator <a href="/wiki/Hiromu_Arakawa" id="w">Hiromu Arakawa</a> states in an <a href="/wiki/Omake" id="w">omake</a> that Scar snuck up on and killed Grand while he was skipping home one night. He does not make an actual appearance until chapter sixty of the manga, appearing during a flashback to the Isvalan Civil War. Instead of the anime&#39;s portrayal of Grand as a blood-seeking warrior, the manga portrays him as somewhat of a pacifist. Though he kills countless Isvalans, he defies orders by sparing those who surrender and even kills a superior officer that orders him to execute helpless prisoners.</p>
<a id="Hohenheim" name="Hohenheim"></a><h3>Hohenheim</h3>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Hohenheim_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Hohenheim</a></b> is the father of <a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Ed</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alphonse_Elric" id="w">Alphonse Elric</a> with a keen knowledge of alchemical processes.

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Zolf J. Kimblee</b>, the &#34;Crimson Alchemist&#34;, is a deranged psychopath who loves the sight of blood and death. He earned fame during the Isvalan Civil War for his ruthless commitment to the Ishvalan extermination, killing thousands without remorse through his unique brand of alchemy. Using transmutation circles tattooed to the palms of his hands, Kimblee can turn anything he comes into contact with into a bomb, be it people or distant buildings. Because of his effectiveness in wiping out the Ishvalans, Kimblee was given an imperfect Philosopher&#39;s Stone to increase his alchemical abilities. With it, he killed <a href="/wiki/Scar_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Scar</a>&#39;s family and gave Scar his characteristic cross-shaped scar. After the war was over Kimblee, wishing to keep the stone for himself, killed the superior officers that knew he had it so as to keep it a secret. He was put in jail for his crimes.</p>
<p>In the anime, Kimblee escapes from jail and joins <a href="/wiki/#Greed" id="w">Greed</a>, though only so that he can betray him and get re-enlisted in the military. He later infiltrates the city of Lior to instigate an uprising against the military. Kimblee encounters Scar while there, and after a failed effort to blow him up he is killed by the Isvalan. In the manga, Kimblee is released from jail so that he can help the <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculi</a>. He is given a new stone to replace the one he had kept from the war, and is sent to retrieve the escaped <a href="/wiki/#Tim Marcoh" id="w">Tim Marcoh</a>. He runs into Scar along the way, is heavily wounded during the ensuing battle, and is forced to flee to save his own life. He recovers at Brigg&#39;s Fortress where he is instructed to start a bloody conflict reminiscent of Ishval.

<a id="Lyra" name="Lyra"></a><h3>Lyra</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Lyra</b>, a young girl who appears only in the anime, is first introduced as a subordinate of <a href="/wiki/#Yoki" id="w">Yoki</a>. She aspires to be a State Alchemist, and uses a necklace that bears a small transmutation circle to condense the moisture in the air and force it at high velocity toward her opponents. When she is defeated in battle by <a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Edward Elric</a> she becomes the apprentice of <a href="/wiki/Dante_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Dante</a> in an effort to improve her abilities. The aging Dante performs a body switch with Lyra soon afterwards, leaving her to suffer the wrath of Dante&#39;s enemies.</p>
<a id="Tim_Marcoh" name="Tim_Marcoh"></a><h3>Tim Marcoh</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Tim Marcoh</b>, formerly the &#34;Crystal Alchemist&#34;, was the leading researcher in the military&#39;s Philosopher&#39;s Stone creation project. After sacrificing a number of innocent Ishvalans during the Ishval Civil War to create new stones, he fled the military with some imperfect stone samples. He settles down in a small country town where he uses his stones to heal the sick under the identity of &#34;Doctor Mauro&#34;. He is later found by the Elric brothers, and he directs them to some of the research he left behind in Central to help them in their search for the Philosopher&#39;s Stone. In the anime he is soon afterwards taken into military custody, only to be killed by the <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculus</a>, <a href="/wiki/#Lust" id="w">Lust</a>.</p>
<p>In the manga, Marcoh takes a greater role in the ongoing story. When first found by the homunculi he is kept under house arrest, forced to stay put and alive or risk the destruction of his town. He is later taken into their custody to be used in their future plans, and is kept locked up deep below Central. While there he is found by <a href="/wiki/Scar_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Scar</a>. Seeing Scar as a means to an end, he tells Scar of his involvement in the Ishvalan War in the hopes of being killed in vengeance. Scar, instead, only disfigures his face beyond recognition and forces him to help in bringing down the homunculi.</p>
<a id="Roy_Mustang" name="Roy_Mustang"></a><h3>Roy Mustang</h3>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Roy_Mustang" id="w">Roy Mustang</a></b>, the &#34;Flame Alchemist&#34;, is a high-ranking member of the State Military. He has hopes of becoming the leader of Amestris, and uses his many subordinates to further him along this path.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Russell</i> {{anime voices}}</li>
<li><i>Fletcher</i> {{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Russell Tringum</b> and his younger brother <b>Fletcher</b> are the sons of the famed alchemist Nash Tringum. Their characters are adapted by the anime from the <a href="/wiki/Light_novel" id="w">light novel</a> <i>The Land of Sand</i>, not the manga. They seek to complete their father&#39;s research with a substance known as &#34;red water&#34;, a toxic liquid with alchemical properties. To help them in this endeavor they impersonate the Elric brothers to gain access to resources and locations reserved for State Alchemists. Though Fletcher is reluctant to do this, Russell insists that nobody will mind. Similarly, although Edward and Russell fight near constantly, Fletcher and Alphonse are able to get along. The two Tringum brothers tend to utilize alchemy involving plants.</p>
<a id="Shou_Tucker" name="Shou_Tucker"></a><h3>Shou Tucker</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Shou Tucker</b>, the &#34;Sewing-Life Alchemist&#34;, is introduced early on in the series. He is famed for creating a <a href="/wiki/#Chimera" id="w">chimera</a> that could talk, albeit only one phrase: &#34;kill me&#34;. After meeting Tucker, the Elric brothers discover that the talking chimera was actually his wife fused with another animal. Before they can alert the State Military Tucker also turns his daughter, Nina, into a chimera. In the manga Tucker is killed by <a href="/wiki/Scar_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Scar</a> soon afterwards, though in the anime he is merely taken into military custody. There, Tucker is recruited by the military to help in creating an army of super soldiers. Though he agrees, he instead uses the resources given to him to try and bring Nina back to life. He switches allegiances regularly for the remainder of the anime, crossing paths with the Elric brothers as he tries to find a way to restore his daughter. In the end he is only able to recreate Nina&#39;s body, though at the cost of his appearance becoming that of a man crucified upon the back of a humanoid dog.</p>
<a id="State_Military" name="State_Military"></a><h2>State Military</h2>
<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:State_Military_(FMA).JPG" title="[[Roy Mustang]] and his subordinates"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Military_(FMA).JPG" alt="[[Roy Mustang]] and his subordinates" title="[[Roy Mustang]] and his subordinates" class="location-none type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption"><a href="/wiki/Roy_Mustang" id="w">Roy Mustang</a> and his subordinates</div>
The State Military is Amestris&#39; primary mode of offense and defense. Throughout the history of the country it has existed to put down uprisings and annex surrounding hostile countries into its borders. It is led by <a href="/wiki/#King Bradly" id="w">King Bradley</a>, and utilizes a <a href="/wiki/Military_rank" id="w">ranking system</a> common of most real-world militaries. In the manga, the State Military is really just the puppet force called upon to further the <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculi</a>&#39;s plans.</p>
<a id="Frank_Archer" name="Frank_Archer"></a><h3>Frank Archer</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Frank Archer</b> is a character exclusive to the anime, introduced as the replacement of <a href="/wiki/Maes_Hughes" id="w">Maes Hughes</a>. He is cool, calm, and collected, with a love for violence and war. He dreams of becoming a hero on the battlefield, viewing it as a way to rise up the ranks of the military. To this end he does whatever is necessary to please his superiors and always insures that his actions earn him some publicity. As the series progresses, Archer develops an interest in the military&#39;s various projects, such as the <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculi</a>, the <a href="/wiki/#Chimera" id="w">chimera</a>, and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone. His ambitions of gaining the latter cause the right half of his body to be used in its creation, forcing him to undergo automail modification to to regain his mobility. He becomes mentally unstable as a result of the operations and carries out <a href="/wiki/#King Bradley" id="w">King Bradley</a>&#39;s ordered executions until he is eventually killed by <a href="/wiki/#Riza Hawkeye" id="w">Riza Hawkeye</a>.</p>
<a id="Olivia_Milla_Armstrong" name="Olivia_Milla_Armstrong"></a><h3>Olivia Milla Armstrong</h3>
<p><b>Olivia Milla Armstrong</b> is the older sister of <a href="/wiki/#Alex Louis Armstrong" id="w">Alex Louis Armstrong</a> who appears only in the manga. She is charged with leading Briggs&#39; Fortress and protecting the country from the neighboring country of Drachma. Unlike her brother, who is cheerful and kindly to all around him, Olivia distrusts everyone when she first meets them and has no patience for formalities or idle conversation. She is also, similarly, a firm believer in survival of the fittest. This has earned Olivia a reputation within the military and in Drachma as one who should not be crossed, though her subordinates hold her in high regard. Because she readily joins them in hostile situations and disregards the orders of superiors if she disagrees, her subordinates will answer only to her. She always carries a sword at her side and is proficient enough to be able to defeat her brother with it.</p>
<p>Olivia crosses paths with the Elric brothers when they arrive at Briggs&#39; Fortress. She is initially distrustful of the two, suspecting that they are keeping something from her. After <a href="/wiki/#Sloth" id="w">Sloth</a> infiltrates Briggs she is able to convince them to tell her about the <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculi</a> that control the military. To help the Elric brothers combat the corrupt higher ups (and to increase her rank) Olivia goes to Central to work her way into <a href="/wiki/#King Bradley" id="w">King Bradley</a>&#39;s inner circle. Though she no longer has direct control of Briggs, her subordinates still operate it under her wishes and only appear to obey her replacement. Once she learns of plans to create an army of immortal super soldiers, Olivia has her parents and younger sister leave the country so that they can&#39;t be used as hostages against her or her brother in the coming conflicts.</p>
<a id="King_Bradley" name="King_Bradley"></a><h3>King Bradley</h3>
<p><b>Führer President King Bradley</b> is the head of the State Military. Though initially portrayed as a kindly ruler who ages like any other human, he is later revealed to be a <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculi</a> in both the anime and the manga. In the anime he is <a href="/wiki/#Pride" id="w">Pride</a>, while in the manga he is <a href="/wiki/#Wrath" id="w">Wrath</a>.</p>
<a id="Heymans_Breda" name="Heymans_Breda"></a><h3>Heymans Breda</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Heymans Breda</b> is one of <a href="/wiki/Roy_Mustang" id="w">Roy Mustang</a>&#39;s most trusted subordinates. He was recruited by Mustang for his high level of intelligence, indicated by his talent with <a href="/wiki/Chess" id="w">chess</a> and other strategy games. Breda is usually tasked by Mustang with jobs that require he travel abroad. In the course of doing so he uses up all of his days off, showing his dedication to Mustang. He is transferred to Western Headquarters when Mustang&#39;s group is broken up by the <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculi</a>.</p>
<a id="Denny_Brosh" name="Denny_Brosh"></a><h3>Denny Brosh</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Denny Brosh</b> is the partner of <a href="/wiki/#Maria Ross" id="w">Maria Ross</a>. He is rather nosy and lazy, and has an enormous infatuation with his partner. He is very sensitive to criticism, and will fall into despair at the slightest insult. Both he and Ross are introduced when they are assigned to protect <a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Edward Elric</a>. In the anime, Brosh later appears in the rebellion against <a href="/wiki/#King Bradley" id="w">King Bradley</a>, saving various characters from execution. In the manga he has yet to play a very big role in the plot; his only appearance after the end of his protection of the Elric brothers is after Ross&#39;s apparent death. Though he is deeply saddened by the news, Ross feels it is for the best that he not know she is alive, as he has the tendency to be a blabbermouth.</p>
<a id="Buccaneer" name="Buccaneer"></a><h3>Buccaneer</h3>
<p><b>Buccaneer</b> is stationed at Briggs&#39; Fortress under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/#Olivia Milla Armstrong" id="w">Olivia Milla Armstrong</a>. He is a large, heavyset man with a thin mustache and an oriental looking face. He has been shown with two different pieces of automail in the series; the first, &#34;Crocodile&#34; is equipped with a kind of chainsaw that, when wound up, can crush a person&#39;s limbs. The second, called &#34;Mad Bear&#34;, is outfitted with a diamond claw, perfect for close-quarter combat. Though he obeys Armstrong unquestioningly and trusts her allies, he dislikes <a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Edward Elric</a> for outranking him despite his age.</p>
<a id="Vato_Falman" name="Vato_Falman"></a><h3>Vato Falman</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Vato Falman</b> is one of <a href="/wiki/Roy_Mustang" id="w">Roy Mustang</a>&#39;s most trusted subordinates. He was recruited by Mustang for his innate ability to remember almost every detail, allowing him to act as a sort of recording device that does not leave any physical evidence. Because his intellect is his area of expertise, he does not have much experience in the field, causing him to make rookie mistakes when in a combat situation. He is overly formal, causing some of his comrades to wish he would lighten up. Falman does not play a large role in the anime, only being another of Mustang&#39;s subordinates. In the manga Mustang tasks him with &#34;babysitting&#34; <a href="/wiki/#Barry the Chopper" id="w">Barry the Chopper</a> to keep him out of the public eye and from killing civilians for fun. Later, Falman is transferred to Northern Headquarters when Mustang&#39;s group is broken up by the <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculi</a>. He is subsequently transferred again, this time to Brigg&#39;s Fortress where he is given what about to janitorial duties. There he reunites with the Elric brothers, and helps them and Brigg&#39;s forces plan against the homunculi.</p>
<a id="Kain_Fuery" name="Kain_Fuery"></a><h3>Kain Fuery</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Kain Fuery</b> is one of <a href="/wiki/Roy_Mustang" id="w">Roy Mustang</a>&#39;s most trusted subordinates. He is overly kind in nature, both to people and to animals. He was recruited by Mustang for his technological expertise. As such, he primarily helps Mustang with communications, both in creating secure lines and tapping into others. He is transferred to Southern Headquarters when Mustang&#39;s group is broken up by the <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculi</a>.</p>
<a id="Grumman" name="Grumman"></a><h3>Grumman</h3>
<p><b>Grumman</b> is the commander of the Eastern Headquarters. He is an old man with gray hair and a moustache, and takes a lighthearted approach to his command. When <a href="/wiki/Roy_Mustang" id="w">Roy Mustang</a> transfers from Eastern Headquarters to Central, Grumman authorizes the transfer of Mustang subordinates, including his granddaughter <a href="/wiki/#Riza Hawkeye" id="w">Riza Hawkeye</a>. He makes no further contributions in the anime, though during a brief cameo in <i><a href="/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist_the_Movie:_Conqueror_of_Shamballa" id="w">Conqueror of Shamballa</a></i> he is implied to have replaced <a href="/wiki/#King Bradley" id="w">King Bradley</a>. In the manga, after the <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculi</a> strip Mustang of his subordinates, he calls for Grumman&#39;s aid. Grumman, not under the homunculi&#39;s surveillance, has since been acting on Mustang&#39;s behalf in intelligence gathering.</p>
<a id="Jean_Havoc" name="Jean_Havoc"></a><h3>Jean Havoc</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Jean Havoc</b> is one of <a href="/wiki/Roy_Mustang" id="w">Roy Mustang</a>&#39;s most trusted subordinates. He is usually seen smoking a cigarette. He was recruited by Mustang for his loyalty and general sincerity, as well as his above average shooting skills. Because working for Mustang requires moving frequently and a complete dedication of time, Havoc has very little free time and cannot maintain a relationship with a woman for very long. Havoc does not play a large role in the anime, only being another of Mustang&#39;s subordinates. In the manga he unknowingly dates the big-busted <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculus</a>, <a href="/wiki/#Lust" id="w">Lust</a>, who tries to extract information about Mustang from him. She is unsuccessful, and eventually reveals her true identity to him. In the course of the attempt to kill her, Havoc is severely injured and Mustang is forced to use fire to seal the wounds. Though this saves Havoc&#39;s life, the lower half of his body is completely paralyzed. Feeling that he can no longer be of use to Mustang, he tries to leave the military, but is instead encouraged to find another way to help Mustang&#39;s cause.</p>
<a id="Riza_Hawkeye" name="Riza_Hawkeye"></a><h3>Riza Hawkeye</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p><b>Riza Hawkeye</b> is <a href="/wiki/Roy_Mustang" id="w">Roy Mustang</a>&#39;s most trusted subordinate. She carries out many of the tasks he is too lazy to do, acts as his personal assistant, and protects him from danger. She also doubles as his voice of reason, keeping cool in heated situations and scolding him when he allows his emotions to get in the way. Riza and Roy seem to share a close relationship in both adaptions of <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>; in the anime she identifies him as her most precious person, whereas in the manga she loses her resolve to live when believing he has been killed. Riza specializes in firearms, particularly sniper rifles, and can hit nearly any target with lethal accuracy. She adopts a dog, called Black Hayate, in both the anime and the manga, which she raises with stern discipline; when Hayate goes to the bathroom inside, she shoots at the wall behind him to reinforce that doing so is bad.</p>
<p>While Riza does not extend far past the role of Mustang&#39;s subordinate in the anime, she takes on a more central role in the manga. When Mustang begins to learn too much about the <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculi</a>, Riza is reassigned as <a href="/wiki/#King Bradley" id="w">King Bradley</a> assistant, a hostage to be used if Mustang steps out of line. Though she no longer works under Mustang, she still keeps an eye out for ways to make his plans of becoming Führer come true; she discovers that King Bradley&#39;s son, <a href="/wiki/#Selim Bradley" id="w">Selim Bradley</a>, is a homunculus, and sends her discovery to him as soon as she can.</p>
<a id="Maes_Hughes" name="Maes_Hughes"></a><h3>Maes Hughes</h3>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Maes_Hughes" id="w">Maes Hughes</a></b> is an old friend of <a href="/wiki/Roy_Mustang" id="w">Roy Mustang</a>. He works in the military&#39;s intelligence division, where he learns of the <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculi</a>&#39;s control over the country. Before he can get word of his discovery to Mustang he is killed by <a href="/wiki/#Envy" id="w">Envy</a>. Nevertheless, his death leads Mustang to discovering the truth for himself.</p>
<a id="Miles" name="Miles"></a><h3>Miles</h3>
<p><b>Miles</b> is stationed at Briggs&#39; Fortress under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/#Olivia Milla Armstrong" id="w">Olivia Milla Armstrong</a>. Because his grandfather was from Ishval, Miles possesses the dark skin and red eyes characteristic of Isvalans. Armstrong, despite being ordered to discharge and imprison him during the Ishvalan Civil War, ignored orders, believing that his ethnicity has nothing to do with how good a soldier he is. He is unquestioningly loyal to her for this, and serves as her assistant. He wears sunglasses to hide his red eyes from others to avoid scrutiny. Despite this, he is proud of his heritage, being glad that <a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Edward Elric</a> does not pity him for it and telling fellow Ishvalan <a href="/wiki/Scar_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Scar</a> that he remains in the military so as to change its perception of Ishval.</p>
<a id="Raven" name="Raven"></a><h3>Raven</h3>
<p><b>Raven</b> is a high-ranking military official exclusive to the manga.

<p>Scar&#39;s older brother is never named in the series. He broke with his culture&#39;s taboo by practicing alchemy, combining the elements used by alchemists in Amestris and <a href="/wiki/#Xing" id="w">Xing</a>, culminating in a series of tattoos on both of his arms. His right arm reconstructs matter and the left deconstructs. In the anime, Scar&#39;s brother used his alchemical knowledge to try and revive the woman he loved, an act that created <a href="/wiki/#Lust" id="w">Lust</a>. He was exiled for his efforts, though returned during the civil war to try and help his people create a Philosopher&#39;s Stone. In the manga he is never exiled and practices alchemy only out of a quest for knowledge. In both mediums, Scar&#39;s brother is killed by <a href="/wiki/#Zolf J. Kimblee" id="w">Zolf J. Kimblee</a>. Before dying he gives Scar his left arm to replace the one that was lost to Kimblee, which in the anime contains the Ishvalan&#39;s incomplete Philosopher&#39;s Stone.</p>
<a id="Xing" name="Xing"></a><h2>Xing</h2>
<p>Xing is a country far away from Amestris that is introduced only in the manga. Its people are oriental in appearance, and are split into fifty families under the rule of a single emperor.

In the current storyline, the emperor is in failing health and his children whose families are not in good standing seek to earn his trust in his final days. Two of his children, prince <a href="/wiki/Ling_Yao" id="w">Ling Yao</a> and princess <a href="/wiki/#Mei Chan" id="w">Mei Chan</a> go to Amestris in separate attempts to find the fabled Philosopher&#39;s Stone and gain immortality, hoping that doing so will convince the emperor to make them his successor.</p>

He leaves his prince&#39;s side for an extended period of time when helping <a href="/wiki/#Maria Ross" id="w">Maria Ross</a> escape to Xing. Upon his return he takes Lan Fan away to search for a way to restore her missing arm, though they plan to someday return to take Ling home.</p>
<a id="Lan_Fan" name="Lan_Fan"></a><h3>Lan Fan</h3>
<p><b>Lan Fan</b> is one of <a href="/wiki/Ling_Yao" id="w">Ling Yao</a>&#39;s bodyguards. She is the granddaughter of Ling&#39;s other bodyguard, <a href="/wiki/#Fu" id="w">Fu</a>, and is implied by Ling to be younger than himself. She is a skilled fighter despite her age and can keep up with or defend against seasoned warriors. She is fiercely protective of her prince and instantly attacks anyone who speaks poorly of him. This makes for a weakness in battle; by insulting Ling in some way her opponent can break her usually perfect battle form and leave her open to attack. In protecting Ling, Lan Fan is severely injured by <a href="/wiki/#King Bradley" id="w">King Bradley</a>. To get Bradley off her scent, allowing Ling a chance to escape, she severs her left arm and ties it to a dog to lead Bradley away. After regaining consciousness she asks <a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Edward Elric</a> where to find an automail mechanic so that she can restore her arm and start protecting Ling again. Though he recommends a friendly mechanic, Fu declines his charity, not wanting to endanger their friends. Fu and Lan Fan leave to find a mechanic on their own, though they plan to someday return to take Ling home.</p>
<a id="Ling_Yao" name="Ling_Yao"></a><h3>Ling Yao</h3>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Ling_Yao" id="w">Ling Yao</a></b> is the twelfth prince of Xing. He is the first introduced and most commonly seen character from Xing.

<a id="Mei_Chan" name="Mei_Chan"></a><h3>Mei Chan</h3>
<p><b>Mei Chan</b> is the seventeenth princess of Xing. Unlike Ling Yao she comes to Amestris without any bodyguards, only having her small pet panda, Xiao Mei, to keep her company. Mei Chan has learned how to utilize Xing&#39;s brand of alchemy; by using throwing knives to create two transmutation circle arrays, one at her intended target and one near herself, she can manipulate objects&#39; form over long distances. She is somewhat imaginative in nature; when first hearing of <a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Edward Elric</a>&#39;s alchemical skills, she pictures him as a tall, handsome young man. When this is proven to be false upon actually meeting him, she proclaims that he intentionally misled her and they develop a feud over who is shorter. Soon after arriving in Amestris to find a method of immortality, Mei Chan is teamed up with <a href="/wiki/Scar_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Scar</a>. She helps him as he travels the country, unknowingly fighting the Elric brothers on occasion before she teams up with them as well. Together their group is eventually able to capture the <a href="/wiki/#Homunculi" id="w">homunculus</a>, <a href="/wiki/#Envy" id="w">Envy</a>, and Mei Chan is sent home to Xing so that she doesn&#39;t need to get further involved in the country&#39;s conflicts. Envy convinces her to stay, and she heads to Central in search for her firends.</p>
<a id="Homunculi" name="Homunculi"></a><h2>Homunculi</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Homunculus" id="w">Homunculi</a> are the primary antagonists in <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>. They are a group of artificially created humans who seek to fulfill their leader&#39;s goals of creating a Philosopher&#39;s Stone. In both the anime and the manga each homunculus is named after one of the <a href="/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins" id="w">seven deadly sins</a>. Aside from this, the concept of the homunculi varies drastically between mediums. In the anime, homunculi are created when someone performs a human transmutation to revive a dead person. They will fail to revive the intended person, and will instead create a homunculus that looks exactly the deceased target. These homunculi are led by <a href="/wiki/Dante_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Dante</a>. The only way to kill a homunculus in the anime is by finding a remnant of their original body (a bone, hair, etc.) and having it near them, weakening them and making them susceptible to death.</p>
<p>In the manga, homunculi have a Philosopher&#39;s Stone somewhere in their body. Most of the homunculi that have been introduced were created at the same time as their respective Philosopher&#39;s Stone. Others, such as <a href="/wiki/#Wrath" id="w">Wrath</a>, were humans that accepted a Philosopher&#39;s Stone into their body, gaining the abilities of a homunculi while aging like a human. All homunculi are created by or at the discretion of <a href="/wiki/Father_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Father</a>, being a manifestation of one of his traits; his greed, his lust, and so on. The only way to kill a homunculus in the manga is by expending all of the power in their Philosopher&#39;s Stone, leaving them unable to revive themselves once they have been killed.</p>
<a id="Father" name="Father"></a><h3>Father</h3>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Father_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Father</a></b> is a character exclusive to the manga. He was the first homunculi and is the creator of all subsequent homunculi.</p>
<a id="Lust" name="Lust"></a><h3>Lust</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p>{{nihongo}}, the &#34;Ultimate Lance&#34;, is the first homunculus to be introduced in the series. She is a big-busted woman who primarily works in the shadows, acting as an envoy for her leader in both mediums and encouraging alchemists down her desired path. She is able to extend her fingers to great lengths and can use them to cut through any substance. In the manga, after leading an effort to capture <a href="/wiki/#Barry the Chopper" id="w">Barry the Chopper</a>, her plans backfire when <a href="/wiki/Roy_Mustang" id="w">Roy Mustang</a> infiltrates into the homunculi&#39;s secret layer. Though she is able to severely wound him, he sears his wounds shut and repeatedly burns her to death, killing her.</p>
<p>In the anime, Lust was created when <a href="/wiki/#Scar&#39;s brother" id="w">Scar&#39;s brother</a> tried to revive his dead lover. Though originally largely the same as her manga counterpart, Lust begins to crave becoming a human as the series progresses. This leads her to defecting from the homunculi and joining sides with <a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Edward Elric</a> under the condition that they help make her human. She is ultimately tracked down by <a href="/wiki/#Wrath" id="w">Wrath</a> who, after paralyzing her with a locket that contains strands of hair from her original body, kills her.</p>
<a id="Gluttony" name="Gluttony"></a><h3>Gluttony</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p>{{nihongo}} is one of the first homunculi to appear in the series, typically being in the company of <a href="/wiki/#Lust" id="w">Lust</a>. He is a large, simple-minded homunculus whose thoughts rarely stray far from eating. He has powerful jaws, acidic saliva, and can and will eat almost anything. He particularly likes eating people, and the only way he can find enjoyment in a battle is if he can eat his opponent afterwards. In the anime, after Lust&#39;s death, <a href="/wiki/Dante_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Dante</a> transforms Gluttony into a mindless eating machine, an act that ultimately backfires when he eats her. He appears again in <i><a href="/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist_the_Movie:_Conqueror_of_Shamballa" id="w">Conqueror of Shamballa</a></i>, having transformed into a large, multi-limbed monster since his appearance in the anime. He exclusively attacks <a href="/wiki/#Wrath" id="w">Wrath</a> during the movie, giving <a href="/wiki/Alphonse_Elric" id="w">Alphonse Elric</a> an easy opportunity to use Gluttony to create a gate to the real world.</p>
<p>In the manga, Gluttony is the failed product of <a href="/wiki/Father_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Father</a>&#39;s attempts to create a Gate of Truth. When activating this gate Gluttony&#39;s stomach opens up, revealing a large eye at its center. His ribs spread out to act as a border for the gate, and then double as large extendable teeth. With these teeth Gluttony can consume everything in his eye&#39;s field of vision in an instant, which is then transported to a realm within himself. Artifacts from centuries before the start of the series can be found there, indicating Gluttony&#39;s age. Gluttony tries to use this form to kill <a href="/wiki/Roy_Mustang" id="w">Roy Mustang</a>, Lust&#39;s killer, though he makes the mistake of eating <a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Edward Elric</a> and <a href="/wiki/#Envy" id="w">Envy</a> instead. Hoping to make it up to Father, Gluttony takes <a href="/wiki/Alphonse_Elric" id="w">Alphonse Elric</a> to see him, where Ed and Envy are able to escape to. In the ensuing battle Gluttony runs out of energy and he is no longer able to revive himself. Father takes what remains of his Philosopher&#39;s Stone and promises to restore him, all of his memories intact.</p>
<a id="Envy" name="Envy"></a><h3>Envy</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p>{{nihongo}} is one of the first homunculi to appear in the series. He is able to assume any appearance he wishes, be it an animal or another person. He prefers the form of an &#34;adorable&#34; androgynous boy. Because of his ability, Envy is usually used as a spy by the other homunculi, sending him to steal someone&#39;s identity so that he can infiltrate an organization. This leads to him being assigned to kill <a href="/wiki/Maes_Hughes" id="w">Maes Hughes</a>; before completing the job he assumes the form of Hughes&#39; wife and <a href="/wiki/#Maria Ross" id="w">Maria Ross</a>, the latter identity allowing Envy to frame her for his death in the manga. Also in the manga, Envy assumes the form of a disgruntled solider of the State Military and shoots an <a href="/wiki/#Ishval" id="w">Ishvalan</a> child, sparking the resulting civil war. He is very proud of this achievement, as he enjoys violence between humans.</p>
<p>In the anime, Envy was created when <a href="/wiki/Dante_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Dante</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hohenheim_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Hohenheim</a> tried to revive their dead son. His natural form looks like a much younger Hohenheim. When his father left him and started another family, Envy obtained a hate for his father and his two half brothers (<a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Edward</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alphonse_Elric" id="w">Alphonse Elric</a>). When he learns that Dante has killed Hohenheim towards the end of the series, Envy becomes enraged as he had wanted to kill him himself. Upon learning that his father is still alive on the opposite side of the Gate of Truth, he crosses it in search of Hohenheim . In <i><a href="/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist_the_Movie:_Conqueror_of_Shamballa" id="w">Conqueror of Shamballa</a></i>, Envy has taken the form of a giant serpent and is captured by the Thule Society. He is fed Hohenheim as a human chew toy, an act that allows Ed to pass back through the gate the Amestris.</p>
<p>In the manga, Envy was created when the country of Xerxes was sacrificed to create a Philosopher&#39;s Stone. His natural form is an enormous, demonic creature composed of all the citizens of Xerxes. The mass of his natural form transfers over to whatever other form he assumes, causing him to influence the environment more than might be expected given his comparatively smaller size. After the death of <a href="/wiki/#Lust" id="w">Lust</a>, Envy replaces her as the messenger of the homunculi. He issues orders to <a href="/wiki/#Zolf J. Kimblee" id="w">Zolf J. Kimblee</a> to capture <a href="/wiki/#Tim Marcoh" id="w">Tim Marcoh</a>, and displays somewhat of an admiration for Kimblee&#39;s violent tendencies. Envy later goes to personally capture Marcoh, though in the ensuing battle all of the souls of the Xerxes citizens are destroyed and he is reduced to a parasitic form. He is given to <a href="/wiki/#Mei Chan" id="w">Mei Chan</a> to take home with her, but Envy instead convinces her to go back to Central where he will be able to get another Philosopher&#39;s Stone</p>
<a id="Greed" name="Greed"></a><h3>Greed</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p>{{nihongo}}, the &#34;Ultimate Shield&#34;, craves money, women, and other worldly possessions above all else. Because of this he betrays the homunculi in both the anime and the manga, as working for them would deprive him of his greedy desires. He is able to rearrange the carbon molecules in his body to create a shield that coats his body and is as hard as diamond. Greed is introduced when he sends some of his <a href="/wiki/#Chimera" id="w">chimera</a> subordinates to capture <a href="/wiki/Alphonse_Elric" id="w">Alphonse Elric</a>. The State Military soon raids their location to rescue Al, and Greed&#39;s fate from that point further differs between adaptions.</p>
<p>In the anime he escapes the raid and flees to <a href="/wiki/Dante_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Dante</a>&#39;s mansion. Dante, having created Greed when she tried to revive her dead lover, is as a result in the possession of the skull from his original body. This leaves him severely weakened and he is killed by <a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Edward Elric</a>. In the manga, Greed is repeatedly killed by <a href="/wiki/#Wrath" id="w">Wrath</a>, tiring him out and allowing him to be taken back to <a href="/wiki/Father_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Father</a>. Unwilling to rejoin them, Greed is melted down and Father consumes his Philosopher&#39;s Stone. Later, <a href="/wiki/Ling_Yao" id="w">Ling Yao</a> offers to become a new Greed in his search for immortality. Greed is given complete control of Ling&#39;s body, though Ling constantly fights him to regain control. Though this Greed initially has no recollections of his actions as the former Greed, his killing of <a href="/wiki/#Bido" id="w">Bido</a> brings back memories of all his loyal subordinates. Angry with Wrath for killing his &#34;possessions&#34; and further provoked by Ling, the new Greed defects from the homunculi, eventually joining sides with Edward Elric.</p>
<a id="Sloth" name="Sloth"></a><h3>Sloth</h3>

<ul>
<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p>{{nihongo}} differs greatly between the anime and the manga. In the manga Sloth is not introduced until midway through the series, where he is revealed to be a large, muscular, dim-witted man. He is tasked with digging a gigantic transmutation circle beneath Amestris to be used in turning the country into a Philosopher&#39;s Stone. Though he is briefly impeded in this job when he runs into the Elric brothers at Briggs&#39; Fortress, he is allowed to continue his work, finishing the circle in chapter seventy-eight.</p>
<p>In the anime, Sloth was created when the Elric brothers tried to revive their mother, <a href="/wiki/#Trish Elric" id="w">Trisha Elric</a>. Sloth is able to assume a watery composition, which she can use to drown others by grabbing hold of them. Sloth constantly suffers from memories of raising the Elric brothers. Determined to prove to herself that those are Trisha&#39;s memories, not her own, she longs to be able to kill them, as a mother could never kill her own sons. She develops a mother-son relationship with <a href="/wiki/#Wrath" id="w">Wrath</a>, and the two stick together during the second half of the anime. During a battle with the Elric brothers Wrath, having unknowingly merged with Trisha&#39;s remains earlier, merges with Sloth&#39;s body to help her in combat.

<li>{{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p>{{nihongo}} differs greatly between the anime and the manga. In the manga, Wrath is the true identity of <a href="/wiki/#King Bradley" id="w">King Bradley</a>, the &#34;Ultimate Eye&#34;. His eye, usually covered by an eyepatch, gives him the foresight to see all possible outcomes of a given situation, allowing him to predict the moves of any opponent before they happen. His favored mode of attack is with his sword, which he wields with great proficiency. Before becoming a homunculi Bradley was trained with a group of others to become the leader of the country. Once they were old enough a Philosopher&#39;s Stone was inserted into their system a process only he was able to survive. Having once been a human Wrath ages with time, a trait that irritates him since his body can&#39;t keep up with his eye&#39;s predictions. Because homunculi cannot reproduce he was given a family to keep up appearances: his &#34;son&#34;, <a href="/wiki/#Pride" id="w">Pride</a>, and a wife he chose himself.</p>
<p>In the anime, Wrath was created when <a href="/wiki/Izumi_Curtis" id="w">Izumi Curtis</a> tried to revive her infant child. Her attempt failed, and the infant&#39;s body was taken beyond the Gate of Truth. There the child, Wrath, grew up. When <a href="/wiki/Edward_Elric" id="w">Edward Elric</a> later lost his arm and leg while trying to revive his mother, Wrath took both for himself, allowing him to use alchemy and escape to Amestris. In addition to performing alchemy Wrath can merge with any object. Because he is the remains of his former body, he cannot be weakened like the other homunculi, though the cries of a child have a similar effect. After joining the homunculi, Wrath develops a mother-son relationship with <a href="/wiki/#Sloth" id="w">Sloth</a>. When he unknowingly helps to kill her (having merged with the remains of her original body) he became distraught and tried to revive her with human transmutation. He lost the limbs gained from Edward Elric, and is given automail replacements by <a href="/wiki/Winry_Rockbell" id="w">Winry Rockbell</a>. He appears again in <i><a href="/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist_the_Movie:_Conqueror_of_Shamballa" id="w">Conqueror of Shamballa</a></i>, doing constant battle with <a href="/wiki/#Gluttony" id="w">Gluttony</a>. With Gluttony distracted, Wrath tells <a href="/wiki/Alphonse_Elric" id="w">Alphonse Elric</a> to use them both as sacrifices to open the Gate of Truth. Al does so and is able to reunite with Ed, while Wrath is able to reunite with the spirit of Izumi.</p>

His eye, usually covered by an eyepatch, allows him to see everything, even the air in a room . His favored mode of attack is with his sword, which he wields with great proficiency. Because he ages like a regular human, <a href="/wiki/Dante_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Dante</a> considers him her greatest creation, a title he is very proud of. Because homunculi cannot reproduce he was given a family to keep up appearances: his son, <a href="/wiki/#Selim Bradley" id="w">Selim Bradley</a>, and a wife. When <a href="/wiki/Roy_Mustang" id="w">Roy Mustang</a> discovers what Bradley is, Pride gives Selim the skull of his original body to be kept safe. When Selim unknowingly brings the skull back to him during his battle with Mustang, he is severely weakened by its presence, allowing Mustang to kill him by repeatedly setting him on fire.</p>
<p>In the manga, Pride is the true identity of Selim Bradely, something discovered in the latter half of the series by <a href="/wiki/#Riza Hawkeye" id="w">Riza Hawkeye</a>. He is very dedicated to the homunculi&#39;s cause, and doesn&#39;t allow anyone to get in its way; he promises to kill Riza if she tells anyone else that Selim is homunculi. He was created in <a href="/wiki/Father_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)" id="w">Father</a>&#39;s original image, and thus his true form is a shadowy blob with many eyes. He can destroy anything that this shadow comes into contact with. Pride and his shadow can only exist within a given area: Central City and the underground transmutation circle running throughout Amestris.</p>
