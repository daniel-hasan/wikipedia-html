Although <a href="/wiki/Stone_Age" id="w">Stone Age</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Age" id="w">Bronze Age</a> and <a href="/wiki/Iron_Age" id="w">Iron Age</a> settlements are known to have existed in the area,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> the first permanent settlement was established by the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">Romans</a> shortly after their invasion of Britain in AD43.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Known as <i>Clausentum</i>, it was an important trading port for the large Roman towns of <a href="/wiki/Winchester%2C_Hampshire" id="w">Winchester</a> and <a href="/wiki/Salisbury%2C_Wiltshire" id="w">Salisbury</a>. The Romans abandoned the settlement circa AD410<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>, and the arrival of the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxons" id="w">Anglo-Saxons</a> eventually saw the formation of a new settlement circa AD700 across the <a href="/wiki/River_Itchen%2C_Hampshire" id="w">Itchen</a> centred around what is now the St Mary&#39;s area. The settlement was known as <i>Hamwic</i>,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> which evolved into <i>Hamtun</i> and then <i>Hampton</i>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Viking King <a href="/wiki/Canute_the_Great" id="w">Canute the Great</a> is supposed to have defeated the Anglo-Saxon King <a href="/wiki/Ethelred_the_Unready" id="w">Ethelred the Unready</a> here in <a href="/wiki/1014" id="w">1014</a> and been crowned here, and his fabled attempt to &#34;command&#34; the tide to halt may have taken place in Southampton.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Excavations have uncovered one of the best collections of Saxon artifacts in Europe.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hamwic fell into decline in the 9th century,<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> but there is evidence that by the 10th century, a new settlement, which became Medieval Southampton had already been established<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> following the <a href="/wiki/Norman_Conquest" id="w">Norman Conquest</a> in <a href="/wiki/1066" id="w">1066</a>. Southampton became the major port of transit between Winchester (then the capital of <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Normandy" id="w">Normandy</a>.  By the <a href="/wiki/13th_Century" id="w">13th Century</a>, Southampton had become a leading port, and was particularly involved in the trade of French Wine<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> in exchange for English cloth and <a href="/wiki/Wool" id="w">wool</a>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> The <i>Wool House</i> was built in <a href="/wiki/1417" id="w">1417</a> as a warehouse for the medieval wool trade with <a href="/wiki/Flanders" id="w">Flanders</a> and <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>, the building surviving today as the Maritime Museum.  During the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shipbuilding" id="w">shipbuilding</a> became an increasingly important industry, which was to remain for centuries to come.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/English_Channel_naval_campaign%2C_1338-1339" id="w">The town was sacked</a> in <a href="/wiki/1338" id="w">1338</a> by the French, including the pirate <a href="/wiki/Grimaldi" id="w">Grimaldi</a>, who used the plunder to help found the <a href="/wiki/Principality" id="w">principality</a> of <a href="/wiki/Monaco" id="w">Monaco</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> After this attack, the city&#39;s walls - part of which dates from 1175<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> - were extensively added to and reinforced.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> A large part of the town&#39;s walls remain today.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Lacking proper finance for the construction of a full defensive wall, the townsfolk reached a compromise solution, which involved joining the existing exterior walls of existing merchant houses together to form part of the defensive structure. The city walls include <i>God&#39;s House Tower</i>, built in <a href="/wiki/1417" id="w">1417</a>, the first purpose-built artillery fortification in England.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Over the years it has been used as home to the city&#39;s gunner, the Town Gaol and even as storage for the Southampton Harbour Board.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Today, it is open as the Museum of Archaeology. The walls were finally completed in the 15th century.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 12th century Red Lion pub on the High Street, within the old walls, is where in 1415, immediately prior to King <a href="/wiki/Henry_V_of_England" id="w">Henry V of England</a>&#39;s departure from Southampton to the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Agincourt" id="w">Battle of Agincourt</a>, the ringleaders of the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Southampton_Plot" id="w">Southampton Plot</a>&#34;, <a href="/wiki/Richard%2C_Earl_of_Cambridge" id="w">Richard, Earl of Cambridge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Scrope%2C_3rd_Baron_Scrope_of_Masham" id="w">Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham</a> and Sir <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Grey_(1384-1415)" id="w">Thomas Grey of Heton</a>, were tried and found guilty of high treason, before being summarily executed outside the <a href="/wiki/Bargate" id="w">Bargate</a>.</p>

When it was unveiled on <a href="/wiki/6_November" id="w">6 November</a> 1920, it was 1800 names, later raised to 2008.  The Second World War hit Southampton particularly hard because of its strategic importance as the major industrial area on the South Coast.  In particular, the <a href="/wiki/Supermarine_Spitfire" id="w">Supermarine Spitfire</a> fighter aircraft was invented and manufactured in Southampton, a result of 1930s experimentation in the city. Bombing in two days in September 1940 killed 130 workers at the Woolston aircraft factory. There were many aircraft companies based around <a href="/wiki/Hamble-le-Rice" id="w">Hamble</a>, to the east of the city, from the 1930s to 1950s, including <a href="/wiki/Folland" id="w">Folland Aviation</a>, now part of <a href="/wiki/British_Aerospace" id="w">British Aerospace</a>, which built the <a href="/wiki/BAE_Hawk" id="w">Hawk</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hawker_Siddeley_Harrier" id="w">Harrier</a>. <a href="/wiki/BOAC" id="w">BOAC</a> had a <a href="/wiki/Flying_boat" id="w">flying boat</a> base in the docks serving <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British</a> colonial possessions in <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Asia" id="w">Asia</a> in the 1930s and 1940s. It closed in 1950 when land based aircraft became dominant. Nearby, <a href="/wiki/Calshot_Spit" id="w">Calshot Spit</a> was a base for the military flying boat services. </p>
<p>Pockets of Georgian architecture survived the war, but much of the city was levelled. The accuracy of the locally-based <a href="/wiki/Ordnance_Survey" id="w">Ordnance Survey</a>&#39;s maps did not go unrecognised by the <a href="/wiki/Luftwaffe" id="w">Luftwaffe</a>: the German bomber pilots used them to bomb Southampton.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> One notable building to survive the bombings was Southampton&#39;s oldest, St. Michaels Church. Thought to have been commenced in 1070,<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> the building has been added to many times over the centuries but its central tower dates from Norman times. The spire was an important navigation aid for the German pilots and consequently they were ordered to avoid bombing it.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Southampton became a <a href="/wiki/County_corporate" id="w">county corporate</a> in <a href="/wiki/1447" id="w">1447</a>.

<a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2>Geography and climate</h2>
<p>The geography of Southampton is very much influenced by the sea and rivers. The city sits at the northern tip of the <a href="/wiki/Southampton_Water" id="w">Southampton Water</a>, a deepwater estuary, which is a <a href="/wiki/Ria" id="w">ria</a> formed at the end of the last Ice Age. Here, the rivers Test and Itchen converge.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> The Test - which has saltmarsh that make it ideal for Salmon fishing<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> -  runs along the Western edge of the city, while the Itchen splits Southampton in two - east and west. The city centre is located on the peninsula between the two rivers.</p>
<p>Much of the Waterfront has been reclaimed over the years, mainly for use as the Western Docks.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Most of the land used for reclamation came from dredging of Southampton Water,<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> to ensure that the port can continue to handle some of the largest ships in the world. The shape of the coastline gives rise to a natural phenomena in Southampton, known as the double tide.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> This gives the port a much longer high tide period than other ports, making the movement of large ships easier.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Southampton_Ferry_Port" name="Southampton_Ferry_Port"></a><h2>Southampton Ferry Port</h2>

<p>Southampton had been a railways port forever. Ships had sailed from the inner and outer dock to Le Havre, Cherbourg, St Malo and the Channel Islands for years. In the mid 1950&#39;s a new wave of tourist arrived, the one that wants to take his car with him. Southampton realised that the days of the conventional car ferry were limited and looked to develop a ferry port. The old Inner dock was filled in. It was no longer big enough for much commercial shipping and being tidal was now becoming an issue. The entrance to the PAD (Princess Alexandra Dock, (the old outer dock)) was widened, this in itself removed two old berths No4 and No5. A link span was installed on No7 berth and No1 became the sea wall where the lock was, berth No2 and No3 were rotated round 90 degrees and a new pier constructed on an east-west axis and dry dock number 1 filled in. <a href="/wiki/This_shows_an_active_port." id="w">This shows an active port.</a>.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup> </p>

berth	Usage, ships &#38; Time period</p>
<p>No1	Too small for any ferries - Used by tugs etc	</p>
<p>No2n	Used by the Viking 4 without a linkspan. The lip is still visible that she used. 	1967-1981</p>
<p>No2s	Used By Southern Ferries (67-76), later Normandy Ferries (76-81) and later still P&#38;O Ferries (81-85). This was the last ferry berth to be used in the PAD. Ferries run to Le Havre but ialso to San Sabastian, Lisbon, Tangier and Casablanca 1971-1975.  Ships: Dragon, Leopard, Panther, Eagle, Panther (freight)	1967-</p>
<p>No3	Used by Swedish Lloyd for the route to Bilbao. Ships: Patricia	1966-78</p>
<pre>Used By Anzar Linas to run to Santander and the Canary Islands. Ships : Monte Granada, Monte Toledo	1976-77

Used By MacAndrews shipping (owned by United Baltic Corporation)  running the freight ship Bilbao. Ships : Goya	1977-1980

No4	Berth halved in size when dock opening was widened - never used	</p>
<p>No5	Berth halved in size when dock opening was widened - never used	</p>
<p>No6	Used as a Lay-by berth by the Thoreson Vikings when not operational	1967-1983</p>
<p>No7	Used by Townsend Thoreson until the moved operations to berth No3. Ships : Viking1 (later Viking Victory), Viking2, Viking3, Viking Venturer, Viking Valiant, FE2, FE3, FE5, Viking Trader, Anu	1968-1982</p>
<p>No8	Was a continuation of berth No7 and once the &#34;super vikings&#34; operated from berth No7 berth No8 effectively disappeared. Berth was never really used independently	</p>
<p>No9	Was a very small corner berth and was not used 	</p>
<p>Originally use of the PAD was higher than expected with a number of shipping companies using the facilities and opening (optimistically) a number of routes to the Spanish and Portuguese ports. All of these came and went leaving only Townsend Thoreson and P&#38;O using Southampton. Townsend Thoreson would move passenger operations to Portsmouth in the late 1980&#39;s and all freight service across slightly later. The final act in the PAD was when P&#38;O transferred to Portsmouth all its services. The ambitious Continental ferry port had closed after only just over 20 years of use. The land was sold off and a retail/housing development was built on the site. The PAD was not in-filled but converted into a non-tidal Marina. The retail development itself failed and was demolished after only 10 years to make way for more housing and the site has been regenerated.</p>
<p>Other Berths </p>
<p>No30 I am unaware why this was built or who used it originally. It was used by Townsend Thoreson in the late 1980&#39;s with their larger freighters Europic Ferry, Gaelic Ferry and the chartered Stena Ionia. It was later used by Stena - see below.</p>
<p>No49 This was the first link span built in Southampton and was used by Lion Ferry I believe. It was located in a poor position with little marshalling ground and was seldom ever used. It is still there and used for car parking now !</p>

<p>Stena Sealink returned to Southampton in the 1991 with the former St Nicholas now renamed the Stena Normandy running to Cherborug on a one round trip a day basis. She was supplemented by the introduction of the Stena Challenger for additional freight capacity. Once again ABP invested a significant amount in the hope that Stena would be able to establish themselves, but the ships were often empty and the service was short lived lasting 5 years closing in 1996. They used the existing facilities at No30 berth and an additional linkspan created in the Empress dock.</p>
