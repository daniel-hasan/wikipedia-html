<p><b>USS <i>Hoel</i> (DDG-13)</b>, named for Lieutenant Commander <a href="/wiki/William_R._Hoel" id="w">William R. Hoel</a> USN (<a href="/wiki/1824" id="w">1824</a>&#8211;<a href="/wiki/1879" id="w">1879</a>), was a <a href="/wiki/Charles_F._Adams_class_destroyer" id="w">&#39;&#39;Charles F. Adams&#39;&#39;-class</a> guided-missile armed <a href="/wiki/Destroyer" id="w">destroyer</a>.</p>
<p><i>Hoel</i> was laid down by <a href="/wiki/Defoe_Shipbuilding_Company" id="w">Defoe Shipbuilding Company</a> in <a href="/wiki/Bay_City%2C_Michigan" id="w">Bay City, Michigan</a>, on <a href="/wiki/3_August" id="w">3 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1959" id="w">1959</a>, launched on <a href="/wiki/4_August" id="w">4 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1960" id="w">1960</a> by Mrs. Harry H. Long, granddaughter of Lieutenant Commander Hoel and commissioned on <a href="/wiki/16_June" id="w">16 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a>, Commander Allen W. Slifer, USN, in command.  </p>
<p><i>Hoel</i> served as plane guard for <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_carrier" id="w">Aircraft carriers</a> on <a href="/wiki/Yankee_Station" id="w">Yankee Station</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Tonkin_Gulf" id="w">Tonkin Gulf</a>, participated in <a href="/wiki/Sea_Dragon" id="w">Sea Dragon</a> operations, patrolled on <a href="/wiki/Search_and_rescue" id="w">Search and rescue</a> duties and carried out <a href="/wiki/Naval_Gunfire_Support" id="w">Naval Gunfire Support</a> missions during the conflict in <a href="/wiki/Vietnam" id="w">Vietnam</a>.  </p>

After fitting out at Boston, Hoel got underway for her first homeport, San Diego, putting in at Norfolk; May-port and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Guantanamo Bay; Cartagena, Colombia; Canal Zone; and Acapuloo, Mexico, during the voyage. During the passage from Cartagena to the Canal Zone she came upon sailing yacht Stardrift becalmed and adrift enroute to Sidney, Australia, from London. Hoel towed the 36-foot craft 100 miles to safety in Panama.</p>
<p>Hoel arrived San Diego 11 September 1962 and spent the ensuing months completing the various inspections, tests, and trials by the Board of Inspection and Survey. When successful firing of ASROC and TARTAR missiles completed her qualification and acceptance trials, Hoel joined the ready 1st Fleet.</p>
<p>After a 3-week cruise to Esquimau, Canada, Hoel spent April and May of 1963 in Pearl Harbor conducting specialexercises. She then returned to waters off San Diego to participate in the Presidential Demonstration held for President Kennedy.</p>
<p>The months of July, August, and part of September were spent at Long Beach Naval Shipyard for the post-shakedown availability assigned each new ship approximately 1 year after commissioning. At this time improved fire-control radars were installed and tested by successful missile firings. Hoel departed Long Beach 17 October 1963 for duty in the Western Pacific to serve as the flagship of Commander Destroyer Division 12.</p>
<p>In ensuing years she alternated deployments in the Far East with operations off the West Coast. Her 1966 deployment to the Western Pacific began when she departed San Diego 28 July. On September she was on search and rescue patrol off Da Nang, Vietnam. On 8 December the guided missile destroyer became naval gunfire support ship in the Corps I area. She fired 2,100 rounds destroying at least 20 enemy structures and 2 trench networks; damaging 61 buildings, 3 bunkers, 8 trench networks, and 5 roads; and killing 24 Viet Cong while wounding 7. Hoel retired to Hong Kong 21 December but headed for Yankee Station the day after Christmas to screen Coral Sea (CVA-43). On this patrol she helped to rescue a pilot after his A.-A Sky Hawk had crashed.</p>
<a id="Decommissioning" name="Decommissioning"></a><h1>Decommissioning</h1>
<p><i>Hoel</i> was decommissioned on <a href="/wiki/1_October" id="w">1 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a>, stricken from the <a href="/wiki/Naval_Vessel_Register" id="w">Naval Vessel Register</a> on <a href="/wiki/20_November" id="w">20 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1992" id="w">1992</a> and sold on <a href="/wiki/20_June" id="w">20 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a>.</p>
<p>The <i>Hoel</i> was one of seven decommissioned US naval vessels purchased by <a href="/wiki/Charleston_Shipbuilders_Inc." id="w">Charleston Shipbuilders Inc.</a> (CSI) in 1994.  The corporation planned to use the ships&#39; power plants to generate electricity which they would then sell commercially.  In theory, each ship would be able to generate approximately fifty <a href="/wiki/Megawatt" id="w">megawatts</a> of <a href="/wiki/Electricity" id="w">electricity</a>, enough to supply approximately 150,000 households. </p>

<p>The city of <a href="/wiki/Manaus%2C_Brazil" id="w">Manaus, Brazil</a> had rapidly expanded since it was declared a tax-free zone by the <a href="/wiki/Brazil" id="w">Brazilian</a> government in <a href="/wiki/1967" id="w">1967</a>.  <a href="/wiki/Eletronorte" id="w">Eletronorte</a>, the local power utility service, had been unable to keep up with the increasing demand and Manaus experienced frequent <a href="/wiki/Power_blackout" id="w">blackouts</a>.  In <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>, CSI negotiated a thirty million dollar contract to supply power to Manaus.</p>
<p>The ex-<i>Hoel</i> was chosen as the ship to be used. However, the plans of both companies were too optimistic. Eletronorte announced that <i>Hoel</i> would be delivering power within only a few days of its arrival in Manaus. CSI had failed to test the ship&#39;s equipment fully before departing for Brazil and failed to appreciate how many repairs the ship&#39;s 38-year-old power plant might require.  The ship ended up needing weeks of work after its arrival in Brazil before it could begin generating power and numerous repairs after that.  Repairs were much more difficult to accomplish in Brazil because the parts and technicians now had to be brought in from CSI&#39;s headquarters back in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>.  Meanwhile, many people in Manaus had become angry over the failed power delivery and there were violent protests.  <i>Hoel</i> was never able to generate more than a quarter of the electricity that had been promised and that only periodically.  After a year of failed attempts, Eletronorte cancelled its contract with CSI.</p>
