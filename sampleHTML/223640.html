<p><b>Michael Peter Balzary</b> (born <a href="/wiki/October_16" id="w">October 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a> in <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" id="w">Melbourne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>), more commonly known by the <a href="/wiki/Stage_name" id="w">stage name</a> <b>Flea</b>, is an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Bassist" id="w">bassist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trumpet" id="w">trumpet</a> player and <a href="/wiki/Session_musician" id="w">session musician</a>. He is best known as the bassist of the <a href="/wiki/Alternative_rock" id="w">alternative rock</a> band <a href="/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" id="w">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>, of which he is a founding member. His work with the band incorporates several musical styles, ranging from aggressive <a href="/wiki/Slapping" id="w">slap bass</a>, to more subdued and melodic techniques. Aside from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Flea has collaborated with many artists, including <a href="/wiki/Jane%26%2339%3Bs_Addiction" id="w">Jane&#39;s Addiction</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alanis_Morissette" id="w">Alanis Morissette</a>. </p>
<p>Flea first learned to play bass in high school after being taught by close friend and future Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist <a href="/wiki/Hillel_Slovak" id="w">Hillel Slovak</a>, who needed a bassist for his band <a href="/wiki/What_Is_This%3F" id="w">Anthym</a>. Flea eventually joined the group, but left after a few years to join the <a href="/wiki/Punk_rock" id="w">punk rock</a> group <a href="/wiki/Fear_(band)" id="w">Fear</a>. Flea rejoined Slovak to form an intended one-off band along with fellow high school alumni <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Kiedis" id="w">Anthony Kiedis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jack_Irons" id="w">Jack Irons</a>. This band soon evolved into the Red Hot Chili Peppers.</p>

<p>Flea was born in <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" id="w">Melbourne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_16" id="w">October 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a>. His father, Mick Balzary, was an avid fisherman and would often take him fishing.<sup id="_ref-fcinterview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fcinterview" title="">[1]</a></sup> When Flea was five, his family relocated to <a href="/wiki/Rye_(city)%2C_New_York" id="w">Rye</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a> for his father&#39;s job.<sup id="_ref-apterp19_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterp19" title="">[2]</a></sup> In 1971, his parents divorced and his father returned to Australia. Flea and his siblings stayed with their mother Patricia, who soon remarried to a jazz musician and bassist.<sup id="_ref-apterp19_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterp19" title="">[2]</a></sup> Flea&#39;s stepfather frequently invited musicians to his house and <a href="/wiki/Jam_session" id="w">jam sessions</a> would often take place. The family relocated again to <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" id="w">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>, and Flea became fascinated with <a href="/wiki/Trumpet" id="w">trumpet</a>.<sup id="_ref-apterpg20_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg20" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-AMGbio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AMGbio" title="">[4]</a></sup> He had no interest in <a href="/wiki/Rock_music" id="w">rock music</a> at the time and idolized jazz musicians like <a href="/wiki/Miles_Davis" id="w">Miles Davis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Louis_Armstrong" id="w">Louis Armstrong</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dizzy_Gillespie" id="w">Dizzy Gillespie</a>.<sup id="_ref-apterpg20_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg20" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>His stepfather, however, was an &#34;aggressive alcoholic&#34; who eventually became involved in shoot-outs with police. Flea recalled of the situation: &#34;I was raised in a very violent, alcoholic household. I grew up being terrified of my parents, particularly my father figures. It caused [me] a lot of trouble later in life.&#34;<sup id="_ref-apterpg21_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg21" title="">[5]</a></sup> In order to cope with this situation, Flea started to experiment heavily in drugs when he was 13, especially <a href="/wiki/Marijuana" id="w">marijuana</a>, which he started smoking on a daily basis.<sup id="_ref-apterpgs20_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpgs20" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Flea attended <a href="/wiki/Fairfax_High_School_(Los_Angeles)" id="w">Fairfax High School</a>, and was somewhat of an outcast due to his taste in music.<sup id="_ref-apterpgs20_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpgs20" title="">[6]</a></sup> However, he soon met <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Kiedis" id="w">Anthony Kiedis</a>, and after a fight, the two became best friends.<sup id="_ref-apterpg34_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg34" title="">[7]</a></sup> Kiedis recalled, &#34;We were drawn to each other by the forces of mischief and love and we became virtually inseparable. We were both social outcasts. We found each other and it turned out to be the longest-lasting friendship of my life.&#34;<sup id="_ref-apterpg35_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg35" title="">[8]</a></sup> Kiedis became a significant influence on Flea, turning him on to rock music, particularly punk rock.<sup id="_ref-apterpg35_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg35" title="">[8]</a></sup> Flea soon adopted his nickname, given to him by Kiedis while the two were on a <a href="/wiki/Skiing" id="w">skiing</a> trip in reference to his jumpy and capricious nature.<sup id="_ref-apterpg35_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg35" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Flea was also close friends with <a href="/wiki/Hillel_Slovak" id="w">Hillel Slovak</a>, the guitarist of a local band called Anthym. When the band&#39;s original bassist, <a href="/wiki/Todd_Strassman" id="w">Todd Strassman</a>, left the band, Slovak began teaching Flea to play <a href="/wiki/Bass_guitar" id="w">bass</a>.<sup id="_ref-apterpgs40_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpgs40" title="">[9]</a></sup> Following several months of commitment to the instrument, Flea developed proficiency and joined the group. Shortly thereafter, Anthym entered a local &#34;Battle of the Bands&#34; contest and won second place.<sup id="_ref-apterpgs40_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpgs40" title="">[9]</a></sup> During his tenure with the group, Flea began to develop a style of <a href="/wiki/Slapping" id="w">slap bass</a> that would become prominent in future Red Hot Chili Peppers songs. Anthym started to play at local nightclubs, despite the fact that the members were all underage. Flea, Slovak, and Kiedis became best friends, and often partook in the recreational use of <a href="/wiki/LSD" id="w">LSD</a>, <a href="/wiki/Heroin" id="w">heroin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" id="w">cocaine</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Amphetamine" id="w">speed</a>.<sup id="_ref-apterpgs40_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpgs40" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The threesome became fans of the growing punk rock movement in Los Angeles at the time. Flea went from despising the genre to listening to it exclusively: &#34;The beautiful thing about punk rock was the intensity, the energy. And punk deflated the whole bloated rock-star thing. I think that musicians who don&#39;t pay attention to punk have a gap in their knowledge that makes it difficult to communicate in this day in age.&#34;<sup id="_ref-apterpgs40_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpgs40" title="">[9]</a></sup> Anthym changed their name to <a href="/wiki/What_Is_This%3F" id="w">What Is This?</a>, and rapidly became a local club favorite—frequently attracting more than thirty people per show. The band was faltering internally however, and Flea left the group to play bass for a well-established L.A. punk rock group called <a href="/wiki/Fear_(band)" id="w">Fear</a>.<sup id="_ref-apterpgs50_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpgs50" title="">[10]</a></sup> Although Fear was a thriving act, Flea was discontent in the band and left shortly after joining.<sup id="_ref-apterpgs50_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpgs50" title="">[10]</a></sup> He then successfully auditioned for the role of bassist in the British <a href="/wiki/Post-punk" id="w">post-punk</a> group <a href="/wiki/Public_Image_Ltd." id="w">Public Image Ltd.</a>, but rejected the offer; he later admitted that the only reason he auditioned was to jam with the band&#39;s frontman <a href="/wiki/John_Lydon" id="w">John Lydon</a>.<sup id="_ref-apterpgs50_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpgs50" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea began to create their own music after finding inspiration in a punk-funk fusion band called <a href="/wiki/Defunkt" id="w">Defunkt</a>.<sup id="_ref-MOJO_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MOJO" title="">[11]</a></sup> Flea, Slovak, Kiedis and former Anthym-drummer <a href="/wiki/Jack_Irons" id="w">Jack Irons</a> formed a band called Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. The band had only one song, entitled &#34;Out in L.A.&#34;, and was formed for the purpose of playing the song once.<sup id="_ref-apterpg60_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg60" title="">[12]</a></sup> Following the group&#39;s first show at The Rhythm Lounge, the owner of the bar asked them to return, but with two songs instead of one. After several more shows, and the addition of several songs to their repertoire, the band&#39;s name was changed to Red Hot Chili Peppers.<sup id="_ref-apterpg61_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg61" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-VH1behindthemusic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VH1behindthemusic" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<a id="1984-1990:_First_four_albums" name="1984-1990:_First_four_albums"></a><h3>1984-1990: First four albums</h3>
<p>The band&#39;s concert repertoire grew to nine songs, as a result months of playing local nightclubs and bars.<sup id="_ref-apterpg62_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg62" title="">[15]</a></sup> The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape and subsequently secured a record deal with <a href="/wiki/EMI" id="w">EMI</a>.<sup id="_ref-VH1behindthemusic_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VH1behindthemusic" title="">[14]</a></sup> Irons and Slovak however, decided to leave the Chili Peppers in order to pursue a &#34;more serious&#34; future with What Is This?.<sup id="_ref-apterpgs70_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpgs70" title="">[16]</a></sup> Flea ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would be lost without them. He and Kiedis hired drummer <a href="/wiki/Cliff_Martinez" id="w">Cliff Martinez</a> and guitarist <a href="/wiki/Jack_Sherman" id="w">Jack Sherman</a> to fill Iron&#39;s and Slovak&#39;s places, respectively.<sup id="_ref-apterpgs70_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpgs70" title="">[16]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Andy_Gill" id="w">Andy Gill</a>, formerly of <a href="/wiki/Gang_of_Four_(band)" id="w">Gang of Four</a>, agreed to produce their first album. Gill and Sherman clashed with Flea and Kiedis; they continuously argued over music style, sound, and the album&#39;s production.<sup id="_ref-apterpgs78_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpgs78" title="">[17]</a></sup> Flea himself felt that the album &#34;was a big mistake&#34;, but also admited &#34;...we [he and Kiedis] were just disrespectful and obnoxious.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MOJO_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MOJO" title="">[11]</a></sup> The band&#39;s eponymous debut album, <a href="/wiki/The_Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_(album)" id="w">&#39;&#39;The Red Hot Chili Peppers&#39;&#39;</a>, was released on <a href="/wiki/August_10" id="w">August 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/1984" id="w">1984</a> to largely poor critical and commercial review.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> After a relatively unfruitful tour, Sherman was fired in early 1985. Slovak, who had been contemplating a return to the Chili Peppers, rejoined the group after being encouraged by Flea.<sup id="_ref-RHCPbio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RHCPbio" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Funk musician <a href="/wiki/George_Clinton_(funk_musician)" id="w">George Clinton</a> was hired to produce the band&#39;s second album, <i><a href="/wiki/Freaky_Styley" id="w">Freaky Styley</a></i>. The strong chemistry between Clinton and the Chili Peppers was felt instantly. Flea later referred to Clinton as &#34;the warmest, kindest man in the world.&#34;<sup id="_ref-apterpg110_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg110" title="">[20]</a></sup> The mood throughout production was far more positive than that of the band&#39;s previous record.<sup id="_ref-apterpg115_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg115" title="">[21]</a></sup> When <i>Freaky Styley</i> was released in August of 1985, however, it received only a bit more attention than <i>The Red Hot Chili Peppers</i> with roughly 75,000 copies sold by year end.<sup id="_ref-MOJO_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MOJO" title="">[11]</a></sup> Flea was somewhat indifferent to the poor album sales as he had recently proposed to girlfriend Loesha Zeviar, who was pregnant with their child.<sup id="_ref-apterpg127_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg127" title="">[22]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The band hired <a href="/wiki/Michael_Beinhorn" id="w">Michael Beinhorn</a>, their last resort among potential producers, to work on their next album<sup id="_ref-aptr133_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aptr133" title="">[23]</a></sup> What Is This? had finally disbanded, and Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid 1986 after Martinez was fired. Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained. Flea recalled that &#34;it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy.&#34;<sup id="_ref-aptr133_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aptr133" title="">[23]</a></sup> Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving Flea and Slovak to work on much of the album&#39;s material by themselves. Flea and Zeviar married, and she gave birth their daughter Clara. Kiedis was briefly kicked out of the band, and given a month to rehabilitate. Kiedis completed the rehab and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album <i><a href="/wiki/The_Uplift_Mofo_Party_Plan" id="w">The Uplift Mofo Party Plan</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-aptr133_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aptr133" title="">[23]</a></sup> Flea has referred to the album as &#34;the &#39;rockingest&#39; record&#34; the band has ever made.<sup id="_ref-aptr133_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aptr133" title="">[23]</a></sup> <i>The Uplift Mofo Party Plan</i> proved to be far more successful, commercially and critically, than the Chili Peppers&#39; preceding albums; registering at #148 on the <a href="/wiki/Billboard_Top_200" id="w">&#39;&#39;Billboard&#39;&#39; Top 100</a>.<sup id="_ref-billboardrhcp_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-billboardrhcp" title="">[24]</a></sup> Following the <i>Uplift</i> tour, Slovak&#39;s drug use dramatically increased. Flea&#39;s relationship with Slovak faded, and Slovak became isolated and depressed.<sup id="_ref-MOJO_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MOJO" title="">[11]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/June_28" id="w">June 28</a> <a href="/wiki/1988" id="w">1988</a>, Slovak was found dead of a heroin overdose. Flea reflected: &#34;I didn&#39;t really know how to deal with that sadness, and I don&#39;t think [Kiedis] knew how to deal with it either.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MOJO_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MOJO" title="">[11]</a></sup> Irons, who was taking Slovak&#39;s death particularly hard, left the group.<sup id="_ref-VH1behindthemusic_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VH1behindthemusic" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Flea and Kiedis took some time to collect themselves, but decided to keep the band together.

Rumors spread that the band was breaking up, until Navarro stated otherwise: &#34;I want to clarify that the Chili Peppers are not breaking up...Flea and I are more than happy to do both projects, time permitting.&#34;<sup id="_ref-apterpg290_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg290" title="">[40]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Flea also had plans to record a solo album. He asked Chili Peppers manager Lindy Goetz to help him promote the record and his solo career.<sup id="_ref-apterpg290_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg290" title="">[40]</a></sup> Flea eventually abandoned the idea in favor of offering his bass services to other artists. He performed on over forty records from 1995 to 1998, ranging from <a href="/wiki/Alanis_Morissette" id="w">Alanis Morissette</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Jagged_Little_Pill" id="w">Jagged Little Pill</a></i> to former <a href="/wiki/Minutemen_(band)" id="w">Minutemen</a> bassist <a href="/wiki/Mike_Watt" id="w">Mike Watt</a>&#39;s debut solo album <i><a href="/wiki/Ball-Hog_or_Tugboat%3F" id="w">Ball-Hog or Tugboat?</a></i>. He also worked with <a href="/wiki/Tori_Amos" id="w">Tori Amos</a> and <a href="/wiki/Michael_Stipe" id="w">Michael Stipe</a> on a track for the soundtrack to <i><a href="/wiki/Don_Juan_DeMarco" id="w">Don Juan DeMarco</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Navarro was fired from the Chili Peppers in 1998, and Flea questioned whether or not the Red Hot Chili Peppers would stay together: &#34;the only way I could imagine carrying on is if we got John [Frusciante] back in the band.&#34;<sup id="_ref-pp2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pp2" title="">[42]</a></sup> Frusciante had completed drug rehabilitation in 1997 after a severe addiction to <a href="/wiki/Heroin" id="w">heroin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Crack_cocaine" id="w">crack cocaine</a> left him on the brink of death.<sup id="_ref-pnt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pnt" title="">[43]</a></sup> Flea visited Frusciante in early 1998, inviting him back to the Chili Peppers; an emotional Frusciante readily accepted.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<a id="1998-present:_''Californication''%2C_''By_the_Way''_and_''Stadium_Arcadium''" name="1998-present:_''Californication''%2C_''By_the_Way''_and_''Stadium_Arcadium''"></a><h3>1998-present: &#39;&#39;Californication&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;By the Way&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Stadium Arcadium&#39;&#39;</h3>
<p>The band, with Frusciante back on guitar, began writing new songs during the summer of 1998 in Flea&#39;s garage.<sup id="_ref-MOJO_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MOJO" title="">[11]</a></sup> He and Kiedis were less confident in writing the album, after the disappointing results of <i>One Hot Minute</i>.<sup id="_ref-MOJO_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MOJO" title="">[11]</a></sup> Flea had also recently broken up with his girlfriend of two years, Marissa Pouw, causing him to enter a state of depression,<sup id="_ref-apterpg300_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg300" title="">[45]</a></sup> which was only lifted when his daughter, Clara, comforted him after several weeks of crying.<sup id="_ref-MOJO_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MOJO" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Flea was heavily influenced by <a href="/wiki/Electronica" id="w">electronica</a> during the writing and recording of <i><a href="/wiki/Californication_(album)" id="w">Californication</a></i> and he attempted to emulate this when writing bass lines for the album.<sup id="_ref-apterpg300_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg300" title="">[45]</a></sup> <i>Californication</i> took less than two weeks to record; by contrast, <i>One Hot Minute</i> took over a year. When <i>Californication</i> was released on <a href="/wiki/June_8" id="w">June 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a> it received overwhelmingly positive critical reviews and sold fifteen million copies worldwide—more than <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>.<sup id="_ref-MOJO_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MOJO" title="">[11]</a></sup> The Chili Peppers played <a href="/wiki/Woodstock_1999" id="w">Woodstock 1999</a>, with Flea playing completely naked—something he would do again at the <a href="/wiki/Reading_and_Leeds_Festivals" id="w">Reading and Leeds Festivals</a> the same year.<sup id="_ref-apterpg300_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg300" title="">[45]</a></sup> In 2001, Flea founded the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, a school dedicated to help youth progress in music.<sup id="_ref-apterpg320_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg320" title="">[46]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Red Hot Chili Peppers spent most of 2001 writing their eighth studio album, <i><a href="/wiki/By_the_Way" id="w">By the Way</a></i>. The entire band began listening to more melodic, textured music that would reflect heavily on the album.<sup id="_ref-MOJO_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MOJO" title="">[11]</a></sup> Frusciante became the driving force behind <i>By the Way</i>, causing initial strife between him and Flea.<sup id="_ref-apterpg300_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg300" title="">[45]</a></sup> If the bassist introduced a funk rhythm into his bass lines, the guitarist would consequently disapprove.<sup id="_ref-apterpg300_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-apterpg300" title="">[45]</a></sup> <i>By the Way</i> was released on <a href="/wiki/July_9" id="w">July 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a> to positive critical reviews. Although not as successful as <i>Californication</i> or <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>, <i>By the Way</i> would go on to sell over nine million copies worldwide.<sup id="_ref-btwsales_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-btwsales" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>After another two year world tour, the Chili Peppers wrote their ninth studio album <i><a href="/wiki/Stadium_Arcadium" id="w">Stadium Arcadium</a></i>. In 2005, Flea became engaged to his girlfriend Frankie Rayder, and the two bore his second daughter Sunny Bebop, later the same year.<sup id="_ref-itunesinterview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-itunesinterview" title="">[48]</a></sup> Both Flea and Frusciante were more musically conjoined when writing the record. They both found inspiration in <a href="/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix" id="w">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Page" id="w">Jimmy Page</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Eddie_Van_Halen" id="w">Eddie Van Halen</a> among others.<sup id="_ref-interview2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview2006" title="">[49]</a></sup> The double album was ultimately released on <a href="/wiki/May_9" id="w">May 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> to generally positive reviews, selling over seven million copies in less than two years.<sup id="_ref-stadiumsales_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stadiumsales" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
