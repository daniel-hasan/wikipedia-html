<p><b>Alexandros Panagoulis</b> ({{lang-el}}) (<a href="/wiki/2_July" id="w">2 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1939" id="w">1939</a> – <a href="/wiki/1_May" id="w">1 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greek</a> politician and poet. He took an active role in the fight against the <a href="/wiki/Regime_of_the_Colonels" id="w">Regime of the Colonels</a> (<a href="/wiki/1967" id="w">1967</a>&#8211;<a href="/wiki/1974" id="w">1974</a>) in Greece. He became famous for his attempt to assassinate dictator <a href="/wiki/George_Papadopoulos" id="w">George Papadopoulos</a> on <a href="/wiki/13_August" id="w">13 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1968" id="w">1968</a>, but also for the torture that he was subjected to during his detention. After the restoration of democracy he was elected to the Greek parliament as a member of the <a href="/wiki/Center_Union" id="w">Center Union</a> (E. K.).</p>
<a id="Biography" name="Biography"></a><h1> Biography </h1>
<p>Alexandros Panagoulis was born in the <a href="/wiki/Glyfada" id="w">Glyfada</a> neighbourhood of <a href="/wiki/Athens" id="w">Athens</a>. He was the second son of Vassilios Panagoulis, an officer in the <a href="/wiki/Greek_army" id="w">Greek army</a>, and his wife Athena, and the brother of Georgios Panagoulis, also a Greek Army officer and victim of the Colonels’ regime, and Efstathios, who became a politician. His father was from Divri ( <a href="/wiki/Lambia" id="w">Lambia</a> ) of Eleia (Western Peloponnesus) while his mother was from the Ionian island of Leukada. Panagoulis spent part of his childhood on this island during the Second World War, because of the occupation of Greece by the Axis forces.</p>
<p>He studied at the <a href="/wiki/National_Technical_University_of_Athens" id="w">National Technical University of Athens</a> (Metsovion Polytechnic) in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering.</p>
<a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> Politics </h2>
<p>From his teenage years, Alexandros Panagoulis was inspired by democratic values. He joined the youth organisation of the <a href="/wiki/Center_Union" id="w">Center Union</a> party (E. K.), known as O.N.E.K., under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/George_Papandreou_(senior)" id="w">Georgios Papandreou (Sr.)</a>. The organisation later became known as <a href="/wiki/Hellenic_Democratic_Youth" id="w">Hellenic Democratic Youth</a> (E.DI.N.). After the restoration of parliamentary rule, Panagoulis became the Secretary General (President) of E.DI.N., on <a href="/wiki/3_September" id="w">3 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1974" id="w">1974</a>.</p>

<div class="caption">frame</div>
Alexandros Panagoulis participated actively in the fight for the restoration of democracy and against the <a href="/wiki/Regime_of_the_Colonels" id="w">Regime of the Colonels</a>. He deserted from the Greek military because of his democratic convictions and founded the organisation <i>National Resistance</i>. He went into self-exile in <a href="/wiki/Cyprus" id="w">Cyprus</a> in order to develop a plan of action. He returned to Greece where, with the help of his collaborators, he organised the <a href="/wiki/13_August" id="w">13 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1968" id="w">1968</a> assassination attempt against Papadopoulos, close to <a href="/wiki/Varkiza" id="w">Varkiza</a>. The plot failed and Panagoulis was arrested. </p>
<div font-size:85%''="" style=""> In an interview held after his liberation, Italian journalist <a href="/wiki/Oriana_Fallaci" id="w">Oriana Fallaci</a> quoted Panagoulis as saying: <i>I didn’t want to kill a man. I’m not capable of killing a man. I wanted to kill a tyrant.</i>{{ref}}.

<p>Panagoulis was put on trial by the Military Court on <a href="/wiki/3_November" id="w">3 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1968" id="w">1968</a>, condemned to death with other members of <i>National Resistance</i> on <a href="/wiki/17_November" id="w">17 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1968" id="w">1968</a>, and subsequently transported to the island of Aegina for the sentence to be carried out. As a result of political pressure from the international community, the junta refrained from executing him and instead incarcerated him at the Military Prisons of Bogiati (S. F. B.) on <a href="/wiki/25_November" id="w">25 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1968" id="w">1968</a>.

Alexandros Panagoulis refused to cooperate with the junta, and was subjected to physical and psychological torture.<sup id="_ref-ESA chambers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ESA chambers" title="">[1]</a></sup> He escaped from prison on <a href="/wiki/5_June" id="w">5 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a>. He was soon arrested and sent temporarily to the camp of Goudi. He was eventually placed in solitary confinement at Bogiati, from which he unsuccessfully attempted to escape on several occasions.

He reportedly refused amnesty offers from the junta. In August <a href="/wiki/1973" id="w">1973</a>, after four and a half year in jail, he benefited from a <a href="/wiki/General_amnesty" id="w">general amnesty</a> that the military regime granted to all political prisoners during a failed attempt by Papadopoulos to liberalize his regime. Panagoulis went into self-exile in <a href="/wiki/Florence" id="w">Florence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>, in order to continue the resistance. There he was hosted by <a href="/wiki/Oriana_Fallaci" id="w">Oriana Fallaci</a>, his companion who was to become his biographer.

</p></div><a id="Restoration_of_Democracy" name="Restoration_of_Democracy"></a><h2> Restoration of Democracy </h2>
<p>After the restoration of democracy, Alexandros Panagoulis was elected as Member of Parliament as a member of the <a href="/wiki/Center_Union_-_New_Forces" id="w">Center Union - New Forces</a>, in 1974. He made a series of allegations against mainstream politicians whom he said had openly or secretly collaborated with the junta. He eventually resigned from his party, after disputes with the leadership, but remained in the <a href="/wiki/Greek_Parliament" id="w">parliament</a> as an independent deputy. He stood by his allegations, which he made openly against the Minister of National Defence, <a href="/wiki/Evangelos_Averof" id="w">Evangelos Averof</a>, and others. He reportedly received political pressure and threats against his life in order to persuade him to tone down his allegations.</p>
<a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h2> Death </h2>
<p>Panagoulis was killed on <a href="/wiki/1_May" id="w">1 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a> at the age of 36 in a car accident on Vouliagmenis Ave. in Athens. This happened only few days before files of the junta&#39;s military police (the <i>E.S.A. file</i>) that he was in possession of were to be made public. The files, which never materialized, reportedly included evidence of his allegations of collaboration. There was much speculation in the Greek press that the car accident was staged to silence Panagoulis and to cover up the documents in question.</p>
<a id="Poetic_work" name="Poetic_work"></a><h1> Poetic work </h1>
<p>Alexandros Panagoulis was brutally tortured on a daily basis during the junta. Many believe that he maintained his faculties thanks to his will, determination to defend his beliefs, as well as his keen sense of humour. While imprisoned at Bogiati, Panagoulis is said to have written his poetry on the walls of his cell or on small papers, often using his own blood as ink (as told in the poem &#39;The Paint&#39;). Many of his poems have not survived. However, he managed to smuggle some to friends while in prison, or to recall and rewrite them later. While in prison his first collection in Italian titled <i>Altri seguiranno: poesie e documenti dal carcere di Boyati</i> (Others will Follow: Poetry and Documents of the Prison of Boyati) was published in <a href="/wiki/Palermo" id="w">Palermo</a> in <a href="/wiki/1972" id="w">1972</a> with an introduction of the Italian politician <a href="/wiki/Ferruccio_Parri" id="w">Ferruccio Parri</a> and the Italian film director and intellectual <a href="/wiki/Pier_Paolo_Pasolini" id="w">Pier Paolo Pasolini</a>. For this collection Panagoulis was awarded the <i>Viareggio International Prize</i> of Poetry (Premio Viareggio Internazionnale) the following year. After his liberation he published his second collection in <a href="/wiki/Milan" id="w">Milan</a> under the title <i>Vi scrivo da un carcere in Grecia</i> (I write you from a prison in Greece) with an introduction by Pasolini. He had previously published several collections in Greek, including <i>The Paint</i> (I Bogia).</p>

 To most Greeks, Alexandros Panagoulis&#39;s attempted &#34;<a href="/wiki/Tyrannicide" id="w">tyrannicide</a>&#34; rendered him a symbol of freedom, democracy, human rights, and civil and political freedoms. He constitutes a rare instance of an attempted assassin being elevated to the status of hero of democracy due to his political ethos.</p>
<p>Greece issued a postage stamp in his honour (1996) and a prepaid telephone card (1996).</p> 
<a id="Film%2C_music%2C_and_literature" name="Film%2C_music%2C_and_literature"></a><h2> Film, music, and literature </h2>
<p>The life and work of Alexandros Panagoulis attracted the interest of a number of artists.</p>
<p>Renowned composer <a href="/wiki/Mikis_Theodorakis" id="w">Mikis Theodorakis</a>, also persecuted by the junta, set some of his poems to music. Panagoulis collaborated with composer <a href="/wiki/Ennio_Morricone" id="w">Ennio Morricone</a> on the 1974 album <i>Non Devi Dimenticare</i>, which featured Panagoulis&#39; poetry and was partly narrated by him (LP RCA PL31238, 1979).</p>
<p>Panagoulis was the subject of <i>Panagulis Vive</i> (Panagoulis Lives), a 1980 220-minute, four-part Italian <a href="/wiki/RAI" id="w">RAI</a> mini-series directed and co-written by Giuseppe Ferrara (<a class="externallink" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0191716/" rel="nofollow" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0191716/">IMDB entry</a>). He also participated in a 45-minute 1973 documentary <i>Altri Seguiranno</i> (Others will follow), with photography-montage by Silvano Agosti.</p>
<p>Panagoulis became the object of study of several researchers. One of the results was <i>Un Uomo</i> (A Man), by <a href="/wiki/Oriana_Fallaci" id="w">Oriana Fallaci</a>.</p>
