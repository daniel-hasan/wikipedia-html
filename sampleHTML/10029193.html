<b>Paul Cook</b> (born <a href="/wiki/February_22" id="w">February 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/1967" id="w">1967</a> in <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" id="w">Liverpool</a>) is a retired <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> professional <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">football</a> player who, during his lengthy career, played for; <a href="/wiki/Burnley_F.C." id="w">Burnley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers" id="w">Wolves</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wigan_Athletic_F.C." id="w">Wigan Athletic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tranmere_Rovers_F.C." id="w">Tranmere Rovers</a>.  He retired from the game at the end of the 2005/06 season and played as a left sided or central midfielder.</p>
<p>Cook began his career at his local non-league team <a href="/wiki/Marine_F.C." id="w">Marine</a> before being quickly signed up by <a href="/wiki/Wigan_Athletic_F.C." id="w">Wigan Athletic</a>, where he featured in almost one hundred games in a four-year spell.  Cook then had a brief and unsuccessful spell at <a href="/wiki/Norwich_City_F.C." id="w">Norwich City</a> before moving to the midlands to play for <a href="/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C." id="w">Wolves</a>.</p>
<p>He was a very popular player during his time at Wolves, both with the fans and his team mates and became known for his deadly and accurate left foot.  After over 190 appearances for Wolves he made the short journey to <a href="/wiki/Coventry_City_F.C." id="w">Coventry City</a>, where he stayed for two seasons before <a href="/wiki/Tranmere_Rovers_F.C." id="w">Tranmere Rovers</a> paid £250,000 to take him to <a href="/wiki/Prenton_Park" id="w">Prenton Park</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst at Tranmere he became a key member of the team, playing sixty games in just eighteen months, showing his high levels of professionalism and fitness.  In 1997 Tranmere would accept a bid of £250,000 from <a href="/wiki/Stockport_County_F.C." id="w">Stockport County</a> and so regained the fee they had paid for Cook in the first place.  After twelve months at County, Cook began to be regarded as &#39;too old&#39;, despite being just 32.  This led to his move to Burnley, initially on loan but fully signing in July 1999 to play under <a href="/wiki/Stan_Ternent" id="w">Stan Ternent</a>.</p>
<p>Cook&#39;s signing was a masterstroke, and the experienced midfielder was a vital cog in maintaining Burnley&#39;s first division status and was so important that many fans still regard Cook as the best signing that Ternent ever made. {{Fact}} Cook experienced an &#39;Indian summer&#39; to his career, making 130 league appearances over a four year spell.  During this period he established excellent understandings with many players, especially <a href="/wiki/Lee_Briscoe" id="w">Lee Briscoe</a> and the two often devised new free-kick routines to catch Division One defences off-guard.</p>
<p>After a falling out with the manager, Cook went on loan to one of his old clubs - <a href="/wiki/Wigan_Athletic_F.C." id="w">Wigan Athletic</a>, but made just six appearances before he was re-called to again take his place in the starting line up at <a href="/wiki/Turf_Moor" id="w">Turf Moor</a>.  Cook left Burnley at the end of the 2003 season, at the same time as Andy Payton.  The two players got a standing ovation from the fans for their contributions to the club.</p>
<p>Defying doubts about his fitness and age, Cook signed for non-league team <a href="/wiki/Accrington_Stanley_F.C." id="w">Accrington Stanley</a> and went on to become a first team regular in their push for promotion to the Football League.  This target was finally achieved in the 2005/06 season when Stanley were crowned Champions.  Having achieved this aim, Cook finally retired after almost 600 league appearances for nine different teams.</p>
<p>After the end of the 2005/06 season, Cook was granted a testimontial by Accrington as a thank-you for his hard work.  It was played on the 2nd May 2006 at the Interlink Express (now the Fraser Eagle) Stadium, <a href="/wiki/Accrington" id="w">Accrington</a> against a Burnley Select XI featuring old team-mates <a href="/wiki/Dean_West" id="w">Dean West</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lenny_Johnrose" id="w">Lenny Johnrose</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ian_Cox" id="w">Ian Cox</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Ball" id="w">Kevin Ball</a>.</p>
<p>Paul Cook was appointed manager of Conference side Southport on 13th June 2006 a post he was sacked from in January 2007 following defeat at Northwich Victoria.</p>
<p>Paul Cook named as new Sligo Rovers manager Apr 27,</p>
<p>Cook took over from Rob McDonald, who resigned before the start of the season.</p>
