<p>Under his tutelage, Hindi Grantha Ratnākara Kāryālaya became India&#39;s No. 1 publishers of Hindi literature. In recognition of his contributions to Indian literature, the acclaimed Hindi novelist Vishnu Prabhakar called Premiji the <i>&#34;Bhīsma Pitāmaha&#34;</i> of Hindi publishing. </p>
<p>Premiji had suffered from asthma for a long time and passed away owing to old age on 30 January 1960. He left behind his daughter-in-law and two grandsons. His elder grandson, Yashodhar Modi, is continuing his legacy along with his son, Manish Modi. </p>
