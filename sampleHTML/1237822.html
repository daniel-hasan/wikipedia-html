<a href="/wiki/Tom_Morley" id="w">Tom Morley</a> (2003) and <a href="/wiki/Cory_Spedding" id="w">Cory Spedding</a> (2004) sang both for the peace in the world and <a href="/wiki/Joni_Fuller" id="w">Joni Fuller</a> (2005) described her feelings. 
There was no UK representative in <a href="/wiki/JESC" id="w">JESC</a> 2006: ITV had stopped broadcasting the show as their three year contract had ended. The BBC, Channel 4 and S4C had no intention of broadcasting the contest, this meant that the UK was absent from a Eurovision contest for the first time since 1958.</p>
