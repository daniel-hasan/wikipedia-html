The <b>1975 unnamed hurricane</b> was an unusual <a href="/wiki/Pacific_hurricane" id="w">Pacific</a> <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">tropical cyclone</a> that attained hurricane status farther north than any other Pacific hurricane. The twelfth tropical cyclone of the <a href="/wiki/1975_Pacific_hurricane_season" id="w">1975 Pacific hurricane season</a>, it developed from a cold-core upper-level low merging with the remnants of a tropical cyclone on <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a>, well to the northeast of <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" id="w">Hawaii</a>. Convection increased as the circulation became better defined, and by early on <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a> it became a tropical storm. Turning to the northeast through an area of warm water temperatures, the storm quickly strengthened, and, after developing an <a href="/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)" id="w">eye</a>, it attained hurricane status late on <a href="/wiki/September_3" id="w">September 3</a>, while located about 1200&#160;miles (1900&#160;km) south of <a href="/wiki/Alaska" id="w">Alaska</a>. After maintaining peak winds for about 18&#160;hours, the storm rapidly weakened, as it interacted with an approaching <a href="/wiki/Cold_front" id="w">cold front</a>. Early on <a href="/wiki/September_5" id="w">September 5</a>, it lost its identity near the coast of Alaska.</p>

On <a href="/wiki/August_26" id="w">August 26</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">tropical cyclone</a> that was once <a href="/wiki/1975_Pacific_hurricane_season#Hurricane Ilsa" id="w">Hurricane Ilsa</a> degenerated into a remnant <a href="/wiki/Low_pressure_area" id="w">low pressure area</a> about 1200&#160;miles (1950&#160;km) west of the southern tip of the <a href="/wiki/Baja_California_Peninsula" id="w">Baja California Peninsula</a>.<sup id="_ref-1975mwr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1975mwr" title="">[1]</a></sup> The remnants of Ilsa drifted northwestward through the <a href="/wiki/Stratocumulus_cloud" id="w">Stratocumulus cloud</a> field of the eastern north <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> At the same time, a mid-tropospheric <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">trough</a> slowly intensified while gradually undergoing <a href="/wiki/Cyclogenesis" id="w">cyclogenesis</a> to develop into a cold-core upper-level low.<sup id="_ref-potm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-potm" title="">[3]</a></sup> Early on <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a>, a low-level circulation formed within the upper-level low about 930&#160;miles (1500&#160;km) northeast of <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" id="w">Hawaii</a>;<sup id="_ref-epachurdat_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-epachurdat" title="">[4]</a></sup> at that time, the circulation and the remnants of Ilsa were located within 370&#160;miles (600&#160;km) of each other. The <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_storm" id="w">cold-core low</a> rapidly intensified as convection increased, and late on <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a> it absorbed the remnants of Ilsa,<sup id="_ref-tcr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> which influenced the development of the system.<sup id="_ref-potm_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-potm" title="">[3]</a></sup> Convection steadily organized as it tracked westward, and it is estimated it transitioned into a <a href="/wiki/Subtropical_cyclone" id="w">subtropical depression</a> by 18:00&#160;<a href="/wiki/UTC" id="w">UTC</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a>.<sup id="_ref-potm_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-potm" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>With warm water temperatures,<sup id="_ref-potm_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-potm" title="">[3]</a></sup> the system strengthened and began to develop <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis" id="w">tropical characteristics</a>. Subsequent to the development of <a href="/wiki/Squall" id="w">banding features</a>, convection contracted and deepened over the increasingly well-defined center, and is estimated it became a tropical storm by early on <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a> while located about 685&#160;miles (1100&#160;km) north of the Hawaiian island of <a href="/wiki/Kauai" id="w">Kauai</a>. The storm quickly developed a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#structure" id="w">central dense overcast</a>, and by 00:00&#160;UTC on <a href="/wiki/September_3" id="w">September 3</a> <a href="/wiki/Dvorak_technique" id="w">Dvorak classifications</a> began on the cyclone.<sup id="_ref-tcr_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> With water temperatures of over 82&#160;°<a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit" id="w">F</a> (28&#160;°<a href="/wiki/Celsius" id="w">C</a>),<sup id="_ref-potm_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-potm" title="">[3]</a></sup> it strengthened rapidly as an approaching <a href="/wiki/Cold_front" id="w">cold front</a> caused it to accelerate to the northeast. An <a href="/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)" id="w">eye</a> became apparent on satellite imagery, and the storm intensified into a hurricane at 18:00&#160;UTC on <a href="/wiki/September_3" id="w">September 3</a>, while located about 1170&#160;miles (1885&#160;km) south of <a href="/wiki/Aniakchak_National_Monument_and_Preserve" id="w">Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve</a> in <a href="/wiki/Alaska" id="w">Alaska</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> Upon becoming a hurricane, the cyclone was small, measuring about 85&#160;miles (140&#160;km) in diameter.<sup id="_ref-potm_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-potm" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Operationally, the hurricane was not classified due to lack of ship confirmation; by the time it became a hurricane, the strongest winds reported by a ship was 40&#160;mph (65&#160;km/h) about 80&#160;miles (130&#160;km) southeast of the center. Additionally, upon developing a closed eyewall, the cyclone was beginning to interact with the frontal system to its west. However, late on <a href="/wiki/September_3" id="w">September 3</a>, a ship reported a pressure of 1003&#160;<a href="/wiki/Bar_(unit)" id="w">mbar</a> with a 3-hour tendency increase of 13.5&#160;mb, suggesting a minimum pressure of under 990&#160;mbar.<sup id="_ref-tcr_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> At the time, the storm maintained a T-number of 4.0, resulting in estimated winds of 75&#160;mph (120&#160;km/h) and an estimated pressure of 987&#160;mbar.<sup id="_ref-potm_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-potm" title="">[3]</a></sup> Maintaining hurricane status for about 18&#160;hours, the storm continued rapidly northeastward and weakened due to strong <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a> from the approaching cold front. Early on <a href="/wiki/September_5" id="w">September 5</a>, it is estimated the cyclone became <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" id="w">extratropical</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Alaska" id="w">Gulf of Alaska</a> while located about 315&#160;miles (510&#160;km) southwest of <a href="/wiki/City_and_Borough_of_Juneau%2C_Alaska" id="w">Juneau, Alaska</a>. The circulation was rapidly absorbed by the front,<sup id="_ref-tcr_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> and the remnants quickly reached the coast of <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a>.<sup id="_ref-potm_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-potm" title="">[3]</a></sup> The remnants of the storm turned southeastward, and was last tracked definitively to a point north of <a href="/wiki/Montana" id="w">Montana</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
