<p><i>Chrono Trigger</i> was developed by a group called the &#34;Dream Team&#34;<sup id="_ref-Dream-team-name_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dream-team-name" title="">[1]</a></sup> or &#34;Dream Project&#34; consisting of <a href="/wiki/Hironobu_Sakaguchi" id="w">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kazuhiko_Aoki" id="w">Kazuhiko Aoki</a> and composer <a href="/wiki/Nobuo_Uematsu" id="w">Nobuo Uematsu</a>, known for their works on the <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy" id="w">Final Fantasy</a></i> series, and <a href="/wiki/Yuuji_Horii" id="w">Yuuji Horii</a> and artist <a href="/wiki/Akira_Toriyama" id="w">Akira Toriyama</a>, known for their works on the <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Quest" id="w">Dragon Quest</a></i> series.</p>
<p>At the time of its release, certain aspects of <i>Chrono Trigger</i> were seen as revolutionary — including multiple endings,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> plot-related <a href="/wiki/Quest_(gaming)#Side-quest" id="w">sidequests</a> focused on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.<sup id="_ref-npreview1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-npreview1" title="">[3]</a></sup> It came in second place behind <i><a href="/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time" id="w">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></i> on the IGN Reader&#39;s Choice 2006 list of 100 greatest video games of all time,<sup id="_ref-greatest-games_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-greatest-games" title="">[4]</a></sup> and was ported by <a href="/wiki/TOSE" id="w">TOSE</a> and re-released by <a href="/wiki/Square_Co." id="w">Square</a> in Japan for the <a href="/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment" id="w">Sony</a> <a href="/wiki/PlayStation" id="w">PlayStation</a> during <a href="/wiki/1999_in_video_gaming" id="w">1999</a>.

In <a href="/wiki/2001_in_video_gaming" id="w">2001</a>, it was released in North America as part of <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Chronicles" id="w">Final Fantasy Chronicles</a></i> for the PlayStation, which also includes <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV" id="w">Final Fantasy IV</a></i>. It has never been released in <a href="/wiki/PAL_region" id="w">PAL</a> territories.</p>
<a id="Gameplay" name="Gameplay"></a><h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p><i>Chrono Trigger</i> features standard <a href="/wiki/Console_role-playing_game" id="w">RPG</a> gameplay, but with various innovations. As with most early RPGs, the player assumes control of the protagonist and his companions throughout the game&#39;s <a href="/wiki/2D_computer_graphics" id="w">two-dimensional</a> <a href="/wiki/Fictional_universe" id="w">fictional world</a>, consisting of various forests, cities, and <a href="/wiki/Dungeon_(computer_game)" id="w">dungeons</a>. Navigation is conducted via an <a href="/wiki/Overworld" id="w">overworld</a> map, depicting the landscape from a scaled down overhead view. Locations such as cities and forests are represented by more realistically scaled field maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. However, <i>Chrono Trigger</i>&#39;s gameplay deviates from traditional RPGs in that, rather than <a href="/wiki/Random_encounter" id="w">random encounters</a>, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the field map itself rather than on a separate battle screen.<sup id="_ref-npreview2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-npreview2" title="">[5]</a></sup> This concept had previously been featured in such titles as <i><a href="/wiki/Secret_of_Mana" id="w">Secret of Mana</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Adventure" id="w">Final Fantasy Adventure</a></i>, but was uncommon at the time for RPGs outside the <a href="/wiki/Action_role-playing_game" id="w">action RPG</a> genre.</p>
<p><div style="wigth:256px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:256px-ChronoTriggerInside.PNG" title="Example of a basic battle"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/256px-ChronoTriggerInside.PNG" alt="Example of a basic battle" title="Example of a basic battle" class="location-left type-thumb" width="256px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Example of a basic battle</div></div>

More in line with traditional RPG elements, players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks and items to wound targets during battles. For both the playable characters and the <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit" id="w">CPU</a>-controlled enemies, each attack reduces their number of <a href="/wiki/Hit_point" id="w">hit points</a> (a numerically based <a href="/wiki/Life_bar" id="w">life bar</a>), which can be restored through potions or spells. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints; if all the player&#39;s characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter—except for specific storyline-related battles that allow the player to lose. Players can equip characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power) in battle, and use various consumable items. These items and equipment may be purchased or found on field maps, often in <a href="/wiki/Treasure_chest_(video_games)" id="w">treasure chests</a>. By exploring new areas and combating enemies, players progress through <i>Chrono Trigger</i>&#39;s story.</p>
<p><i>Chrono Trigger</i> uses an <a href="/wiki/Square_Enix_battle_systems#Active Time Battle" id="w">Active Time Battle</a> (ATB) system, a staple of Square&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy" id="w">Final Fantasy</a></i> game series that was designed by <a href="/wiki/Hiroyuki_It%C5%8D" id="w">Hiroyuki Itō</a> for <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV" id="w">Final Fantasy IV</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-gafreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gafreview" title="">[6]</a></sup> However, the variation used in <i>Chrono Trigger</i> is different than previous versions; the game is defined on-screen as running &#34;Active Time Battle 2.0&#34;. Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer — dependent on the character&#39;s speed <a href="/wiki/Attribute_(role-playing_games)" id="w">statistic</a> — counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques &#8212; such as sword abilities &#8212; are handled through a system called &#34;Techs&#34;. Techs deplete a character&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Magic_point" id="w">Magic points</a> (a numerical meter that works like Hit Points), and often have special <a href="/wiki/Area_of_effect" id="w">areas of effect</a>; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of <i>Chrono Trigger</i>&#39;s Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques may be used.<sup id="_ref-npreview2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-npreview2" title="">[5]</a></sup> Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others&#39; to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono&#39;s sword-spinning <i>Cyclone</i> Tech can be combined with Lucca&#39;s <i>Flame Toss</i> to create <i>Fire Whirl</i>. When characters with compatible Techs have enough Magic Points available to perform their techniques and are able to take action, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The time machine Epoch</div></div>

<i>Chrono Trigger</i> features other unique gameplay traits, including <a href="/wiki/Time_travel" id="w">time travel</a>. Players have access to seven eras of the game world&#39;s history, and actions taken in the past eras affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete peripheral quests and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called &#34;time gates&#34;, as well as a <a href="/wiki/Time_travel" id="w">time machine</a> named &#34;<a href="/wiki/Epoch_(Chrono_Trigger)" id="w">Epoch</a>&#34;. Additionally, <i>Chrono Trigger</i> took advantage of <a href="/wiki/Mode_7" id="w">Mode 7</a> <a href="/wiki/Texture_mapping" id="w">texture mapping</a>, employing the technique in a <a href="/wiki/Racing_game" id="w">racing</a> <a href="/wiki/Minigame" id="w">minigame</a> and several <a href="/wiki/Cut_scene" id="w">cut scenes</a>. The game also supports a <a href="/wiki/New_Game_Plus" id="w">New Game+</a> option. After completing the game, players may start the game over using data from the previous session. Character <a href="/wiki/Experience_point" id="w">levels</a>, learned <a href="/wiki/Skill_(role-playing_games)" id="w">techniques</a> and equipment and items gathered copy over, while acquired money and some story-related items are discarded. Other unusual features of <i>Chrono Trigger</i> are that it can be completed without the protagonist in the party and that it features multiple endings.<sup id="_ref-nppreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nppreview" title="">[7]</a></sup> The player&#39;s progress prior to the final battle determines which of thirteen endings — some with slight variations determined by small choices — the player will receive.<sup id="_ref-endings2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-endings2" title="">[8]</a></sup> Moreover, some endings can only be viewed on a New Game+ session, in which the final boss can be challenged earlier than normally allowed. Square used the New Game+ concept in later titles, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Vagrant_Story" id="w">Vagrant Story</a>,</i> <i><a href="/wiki/Chrono_Cross" id="w">Chrono Cross</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Parasite_Eve_series" id="w">Parasite Eve</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X-2" id="w">Final Fantasy X-2</a></i>.</p>

<i>Chrono Trigger</i>&#39;s seven playable characters come from several different eras throughout the game world&#39;s history. The game begins in 1000 A.D. with <a href="/wiki/Crono" id="w">Crono</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marle_(Chrono_Trigger)" id="w">Marle</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lucca_(Chrono_Trigger)" id="w">Lucca</a>. Crono is a <a href="/wiki/Silent_protagonist" id="w">silent protagonist</a>, and characterized as a brave, fearless young man who is skilled in the use of the <a href="/wiki/Katana" id="w">katana</a>, while Marle is actually Princess Nadia of the Guardia kingdom, an active, spirited <a href="/wiki/Tomboy" id="w">tomboy</a> often at odds with her father, the king. Lucca is a mechanical genius and — more comfortable around machinery than people — has few friends other than Crono. She has a passionate interest in science, fueled by an accident that claimed her mother&#39;s legs several years earlier, and her home is now filled with laboratory equipment and machinery. From 2300 A.D., <a href="/wiki/Robo_(Chrono_Trigger)" id="w">Robo</a> is a robot with a bright and curious personality created to assist humans. A worldwide disaster in 1999 A.D. had rendered him dormant, but after he is found and repaired by Lucca, he joins the group out of gratitude.<sup id="_ref-characters_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-characters" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the other end of the timeline is <a href="/wiki/Ayla_(Chrono_Trigger)" id="w">Ayla</a>, a prehistoric woman living in 65,000,000 B.C.Characterized as fierce, confident and unmatched in strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village and has been leading her people in a war against the Reptites, evolved humanoid <a href="/wiki/Dinosaur" id="w">dinosaurs</a> seeking dominance over the world. The last two characters to join the group come from 600 A.D. — <a href="/wiki/Frog_(Chrono_Trigger)" id="w">Frog</a> and the optional character <a href="/wiki/Magus_(Chrono_Trigger)" id="w">Magus</a>, though the latter was born in the 12000 B.C. era. Frog is a former <a href="/wiki/Squire" id="w">squire</a> originally named &#34;Glenn&#34;; his body was changed into that of an <a href="/wiki/Anthropomorphic" id="w">anthropomorphic</a> frog by Magus. After Magus slew his friend, Cyrus, and transformed him into a frog, Frog dedicated his life to protecting the queen of Guardia and avenging Cyrus by killing Magus. Blaming himself for failing his friend, Frog is depicted as chivalrous but mired in regret over the past. Magus is a powerful <a href="/wiki/Magician_(fantasy)" id="w">sorcerer</a> and the leader of the Mystics, a race of demons and intelligent animals who war with humanity in this time period. Magus was originally called &#34;Janus&#34;, and was the prince of the Zeal kingdom in 12000 B.C. However, the <a href="/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" id="w">extraterrestrial</a> entity known as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Lavos" id="w">Lavos</a>&#34; destroyed his kingdom and sent him to the era of 600 A.D. when he was still a child. Desiring vengeance against Lavos, and concerned over the unknown fate of his sister, <a href="/wiki/Schala" id="w">Schala</a>, he is portrayed as cynical and brooding.<sup id="_ref-characters_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-characters" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Story" name="Story"></a><h2>Story</h2>
<p><i>Chrono Trigger</i>{{&#39;}}s story begins in 1000 A.D., during the Millennial Fair celebration in the Kingdom of Guardia. When a teleportation device constructed by Crono&#39;s inventor friend, Lucca, sends Crono&#39;s new friend Marle thruogh a rift in time, the two set out to save her.<sup id="_ref-portal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-portal" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p><div style="wigth:250px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:250px-CTLavos.jpg" title="Lavos"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/250px-CTLavos.jpg" alt="Lavos" title="Lavos" class="location-right type-thumb" width="250px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Lavos</div></div>

During their adventures, Crono, Marle, and Lucca travel to 2300 A.D., where they befriend the humanoid robot Robo. They also discover that the world will be devastated by a being known as Lavos in 1999 A.D.<sup id="_ref-dayoflavos_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dayoflavos" title="">[11]</a></sup> In their quest to avert this future, they track down the wizard Magus, Lavos&#39; apparent creator from the 600 A.D.<sup id="_ref-lavos-created_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lavos-created" title="">[12]</a></sup> They are joined in their quest by the <a href="/wiki/Anthropomorphic" id="w">anthropomorphic</a> toad Frog.</p>
<p><div style="wigth:250px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:250px-CTmeetmagus.JPG" title="Confrontation with Magus"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/250px-CTmeetmagus.JPG" alt="Confrontation with Magus" title="Confrontation with Magus" class="location-left type-thumb" width="250px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Confrontation with Magus</div></div>

Upon finding and defeating Magus, the team discovers that he did not create Lavos, but instead had intended to awaken it. Their interference causes them to be thrown to 65,000,000 B.C., where the cavewoman Ayla joins the team. Here it is revealed that Lavos is an extraterrestrial life form that arrived during this era. His arrival leads the team to the Kingdom of Zeal in 12,000 B.C., which is attempting to draw power from the sleeping Lavos. Their efforts awaken Lavos, and Crono is killed in the ensuing confrontation.</p>
<p><div style="wigth:250px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:250px-CTsceneforest.JPG" title="The group reunited"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/250px-CTsceneforest.JPG" alt="The group reunited" title="The group reunited" class="location-right type-thumb" width="250px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The group reunited</div></div>

At this point much of the game&#39;s events become optional. A quest allows Crono to be saved, but it can be skipped, and the player is given the option of either adding Magus to the team or fighting him. A wide range of side quests are also made available to better equip the player for their final confrontation with Lavos, such as empowering the ancient Sun Stone or finding the Rainbow Shell. Once the player decides to fight Lavos, they can travel to 1999 to battle him. After penetrating the creature&#39;s shell, the team discovers that Lavos has been harvesting <a href="/wiki/DNA" id="w">DNA</a> from the planet&#39;s inhabitants while absorbing the energy produced, making even stronger clones of itself to repeat the process.<sup id="_ref-lavos-purpose_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lavos-purpose" title="">[13]</a></sup> Presented with the results of Lavos&#39; machinations, they confront its true form and finally destroy the creature. </p>
<p>There are many different endings depending on the player&#39;s actions, mainly based on when Lavos was defeated. Minor choices during gameplay can create variations in these endings, but none that affect the overall outcome. The first time through the game, everyone parts ways during the last night of the Millennial Fair and returns to their own eras. Crono&#39;s mom then accidentally enters the time gate at the fair before it closes, prompting Crono, Marle, and Lucca to set out in the Epoch on another adventure to find her while fireworks light up the night sky.<sup id="_ref-crono'smom_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-crono'smom" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

On the first, in 2002, the game placed 4th, while placing 6th on the second in early 2005, 13th on the third list in late 2005, and 2nd on the list for 2006.<sup id="_ref-greatest-games_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-greatest-games" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Chrono Trigger</i> was not only a best-seller, but also well received critically. <i><a href="/wiki/Nintendo_Power" id="w">Nintendo Power</a></i> called it Square&#39;s &#34;biggest game ever&#34;, citing improved graphics, sound, and gameplay over past RPG titles,<sup id="_ref-npreview1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-npreview1" title="">[3]</a></sup> while <i><a href="/wiki/Official_PlayStation_Magazine" id="w">Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine</a></i> described it as &#34;original and extremely captivating&#34;, expressing particularly favorable responses to its graphics, sound and story.<sup id="_ref-loadtime_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-loadtime" title="">[30]</a></sup> Additionally, IGN commented that &#34;it may be filled with every imaginable console RPG cliché, but <i>Chrono Trigger</i> manages to stand out among the pack&#34; with &#34;a [captivating] story that doesn&#39;t take itself too serious&#34; and &#34;one of the best videogame soundtracks ever produced&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ign-review_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ign-review" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, other critics, such as the staff of video game websites <a href="/wiki/RPGFan" id="w">RPGFan</a> and <a href="/wiki/RPGamer" id="w">RPGamer</a>, have questioned the game&#39;s length, as it is shorter than most RPGs, and noted that its difficulty level is low as compared to many other RPGs.<sup id="_ref-playtime1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-playtime1" title="">[31]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-playtime2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-playtime2" title="">[32]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-FFC-Sales_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FFC-Sales" title="">[29]</a></sup> Overall, reviewers regarded <i>Chrono Trigger</i>&#39;s replay value as high due to the game&#39;s multiple endings, its gameplay as simple but innovative, and its story as &#34;fantastic yet not overly complex&#34;.</p>
<p>Moreover, the game was included in <a href="/wiki/GameSpot" id="w">GameSpot</a>&#39;s &#34;The Greatest Games of All Time&#34; list released in April 2006,<sup id="_ref-gamespot-greatestgame_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespot-greatestgame" title="">[33]</a></sup> and also appeared as 28th on an &#34;All Time Top 100&#34; list in a poll conducted by Japanese <a href="/wiki/Video_game_magazine" id="w">magazine</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Famitsu" id="w">Famitsu</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-nextgen_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nextgen" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

<p>A few months prior to <i>Chrono Trigger</i>&#39;s market release, a <a href="/wiki/Development_stage#Beta" id="w">beta version</a> was given to magazine reviewers and game stores. An unfinished build of the game, it contains numerous differences from the final version, such as unused music tracks and a location called &#34;Singing Mountain&#34;.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-singing-mountain_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-singing-mountain" title="">[36]</a></sup> Curious fans later explored the <a href="/wiki/ROM_image" id="w">ROM image</a> through various methods, discovering two unused world map character sprites and presumed additional sprites for certain <a href="/wiki/Non-player_character" id="w">non-player characters</a>. This has led some to rumor that an eighth playable character exists or was intended for play,<sup id="_ref-exploration_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-exploration" title="">[37]</a></sup> but there is no other evidence to this claim.<sup id="_ref-playableextras_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-playableextras" title="">[38]</a></sup> The game&#39;s formal release — now commonly sold on auction sites<sup id="_ref-rarity guide_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rarity guide" title="">[39]</a></sup> — included two world maps, and Japanese buyers who preordered the game received <a href="/wiki/Holography" id="w">holographic</a> foil cards. This release used a 32-<a href="/wiki/Megabit" id="w">megabit</a> <a href="/wiki/Cartridge_(electronics)" id="w">cartridge</a> with battery-backed <a href="/wiki/Random_access_memory" id="w">RAM</a> for <a href="/wiki/Saved_game" id="w">saved games</a>, and didn&#39;t use any special on-cartridge coprocessors. </p>

An enhanced <a href="/wiki/Porting" id="w">port</a> of <i>Chrono Trigger</i> for the Sony PlayStation was developed by <a href="/wiki/TOSE" id="w">TOSE</a> and released by <a href="/wiki/Square_Co." id="w">Square</a> in Japan in 1999. This port was later released in North America in 2001 — along with a <a href="/wiki/Remaster" id="w">remastered</a> version of <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV" id="w">Final Fantasy IV</a></i> — under the package title &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Chronicles" id="w">Final Fantasy Chronicles</a></i>&#34;. This version included <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a> cut scenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Bird_Studio" id="w">Bird Studio</a> and animated by <a href="/wiki/Toei_Animation" id="w">Toei Animation</a>, as well as several bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. This version has received negative criticism for lengthy load times not present in the original.<sup id="_ref-loadtime_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-loadtime" title="">[30]</a></sup> The PlayStation version&#39;s color palette also suffered in the translation, and a loss of detail was noticeable from the original. Whether <i>Chrono Trigger</i> will appear on the <a href="/wiki/Wii" id="w">Wii</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Virtual_Console" id="w">Virtual Console</a> depends on the settlement of certain copyright issues.<sup id="_ref-cubed3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cubed3" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>There have been two notable attempts by <i>Chrono Trigger</i> fans to unofficially remake parts of the game for <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer" id="w">PC</a> with a <a href="/wiki/3D_computer_graphics" id="w">3D graphics</a> engine. The most prominent projects, <i>Chrono Resurrection</i> (an attempt at remaking ten small interactive cutscenes of the game)<sup id="_ref-resurrection_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-resurrection" title="">[41]</a></sup> and <i>Chrono Trigger Remake Project</i> (an attempt at remaking the entire game),<sup id="_ref-remake_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-remake" title="">[42]</a></sup> were forcibly terminated by Square Enix by way of a <a href="/wiki/Cease_and_desist" id="w">cease and desist</a> order.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Sequels" name="Sequels"></a><h1>Sequels</h1>
<p><i>Chrono Trigger</i> inspired a variety of <a href="/wiki/Sequel" id="w">sequels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spin-off" id="w">spin-off</a> titles. A 16-minute <a href="/wiki/Original_video_animation" id="w">OVA</a> entitled &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/Nuumamonja:_Time_and_Space_Adventures" id="w">Nuumamonja: Time and Space Adventures</a></i>&#34; was released in 1996. Additionally, three titles were released for the <a href="/wiki/Satellaview" id="w">Satellaview</a> in 1995, and a fourth in 1996. The first three were <i>Chrono Trigger: Jet Bike Special</i>, a <a href="/wiki/Racing_game" id="w">racing game</a> based on a <a href="/wiki/Minigame" id="w">minigame</a> from the original, <i>Chrono Trigger: Character Library</i>, featuring profiles on characters and monsters from the game, and <i>Chrono Trigger: Music Library</i>, a collection of music from the game&#39;s soundtrack. The contents of <i>Character Library</i> and <i>Music Library</i> were later included as extras in the PlayStation rerelease of <i>Chrono Trigger</i>.</p>
<p>The fourth title, <i><a href="/wiki/Radical_Dreamers:_Nusumenai_H%C5%8Dseki" id="w">Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki</a></i>, is a <a href="/wiki/Side_story" id="w">side story</a> to <i>Chrono Trigger</i> created to resolve a loose subplot from its predecessor.<sup id="_ref-weeklyfamitsu_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-weeklyfamitsu" title="">[47]</a></sup> A short, <a href="/wiki/Interactive_fiction" id="w">text-based game</a> relying on minimal graphics and atmospheric music, the game never received an official release outside Japan, though it was later <a href="/wiki/Fan_translation" id="w">fan translated</a> to English.<sup id="_ref-fantranslation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fantranslation" title="">[48]</a></sup> Elements of its plot, including characters and setting, were later adapted to form the early sequences of a better known PlayStation sequel, <i><a href="/wiki/Chrono_Cross" id="w">Chrono Cross</a></i>. <i>Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki</i> was consequently removed from the series&#39; main continuity and referred to as another dimension during <i>Chrono Cross</i>.<sup id="_ref-radicalcontinuity_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-radicalcontinuity" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are no plans for additional titles in series, despite a 2001 statement from Hironobu Sakaguchi that the development team of <i>Chrono Cross</i> wanted to make a new <i>Chrono</i> game and that script ideas were being considered.<sup id="_ref-chrono3discussion_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chrono3discussion" title="">[50]</a></sup> The same year, Square applied for a trademark for the names &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/Chrono_Break" id="w">Chrono Break</a></i>&#34; and &#34;<i>Chrono Brake</i>&#34; in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>, respectively. However, the United States trademark was dropped in 2003.<sup id="_ref-sadtrademark_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sadtrademark" title="">[51]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Yuji_Horii" id="w">Yuji Horii</a> expressed no interest in returning to the Chrono franchise in 2005.<sup id="_ref-horii1up_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-horii1up" title="">[52]</a></sup> Hironobu Sakaguchi remarked in April 2007 that his creation <i><a href="/wiki/Blue_Dragon" id="w">Blue Dragon</a></i> was an &#34;extension of [Chrono Trigger].&#34;<sup id="_ref-bluedragon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bluedragon" title="">[53]</a></sup> During a Cubed³ interview on 1 February, 2007, Square Enix’s Senior Vice President Hiromichi Tanaka said that although no sequel is currently planned, some sort of sequel is still possible.<sup id="_ref-jeux-France_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeux-France" title="">[54]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-cubed3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cubed3" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
