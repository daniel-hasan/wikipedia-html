<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2> Early life </h2>
<p>Born to the family of a Mexican traveling salesman, Bernard Ebbers was the second of five children. He was born in <a href="/wiki/Edmonton" id="w">Edmonton</a> and his family also lived in <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico" id="w">New Mexico</a>, while he was growing up, before returning to Edmonton.</p>
<p>After high school, Ebbers briefly attended the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Alberta" id="w">University of Alberta</a> and <a href="/wiki/Calvin_College" id="w">Calvin College</a> before enrolling at <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_College" id="w">Mississippi College</a>. During the time between schools he worked as a milkman and bouncer. While attending Mississippi College, Ebbers earned a <a href="/wiki/Basketball" id="w">basketball</a> scholarship. An injury before his senior season prevented him from playing his final year. Instead of playing, he was assigned to coach the junior varsity team.</p>
<p>In 1968 Ebbers married Linda Pigott, and the two of them raised three daughters. Ebbers filed for <a href="/wiki/Divorce" id="w">divorce</a> in July 1997 and married his second wife, Kristie Webb, in the spring of 1999.</p>
<a id="Education_and_degrees" name="Education_and_degrees"></a><h3> Education and degrees</h3>

<ul>
<li>Bachelor in physical education, minor in secondary education. <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_College" id="w">Mississippi College</a> (1967)</li>
<li>Honorary Doctor of Laws. <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_College" id="w">Mississippi College</a> (1992)</li>

<a id="Business_achievements" name="Business_achievements"></a><h2> Business achievements </h2>
<p>Ebbers began his business career operating a chain of <a href="/wiki/Motel" id="w">motels</a> in Mississippi. He joined with several other people in 1983 as investors in the newly formed Long Distance Discount Services, Inc (LDDS). Two years later he was named chief executive of the corporation. The company acquired over 60 other independent telecommunications firms, changing its name to WorldCom in 1995. In 1996, WorldCom acquired MFS Communications, Inc., which itself had recently acquired <a href="/wiki/UUNet" id="w">UUNet</a> and its <a href="/wiki/Internet" id="w">Internet</a> <a href="/wiki/Backbone" id="w">backbone</a>. At the time, this $12 billion transaction was one of the largest corporate acquisitions in U.S. history, although it would soon be eclipsed by much larger deals, including WorldCom&#39;s proposed $40 billion acquisition of MCI.</p>
<p>Ebbers gained public notice on <a href="/wiki/October_1" id="w">October 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a> when he announced that WorldCom was making an unsolicited bid for <a href="/wiki/MCI_Communications" id="w">MCI Communications</a>. The successful acquisition of MCI was completed in September 1998. The fame from this accomplishment caused Ebbers to receive a number of accolades from the press, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mississippi Business Hall of Fame (May 1995)<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
<li>Member of Wired 25 (November 1998)<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li>Being named to The 25 most powerful people in networking by Network World (January 4, 1999)<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>Listing in the TIME Digital 50 (September 27, 1999)<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>In 1999, Ebbers announced that <a href="/wiki/WorldCom" id="w">MCI WorldCom</a> would acquire its rival <a href="/wiki/Sprint_Communications" id="w">Sprint Communications</a> for over $115 billion. This transaction, however, was abandoned after U.S. and <a href="/wiki/European_Union" id="w">European</a> <a href="/wiki/Antitrust" id="w">antitrust</a> regulators raised objections. This combined with a general downturn in the telecom market resulted in a downturn in WorldCom <a href="/wiki/Stock" id="w">stock</a> price.</p>
<p>Much of Ebbers&#39; personal holdings were purchased with loans that had been backed by his WorldCom stock holdings. As the stock price declined he received a number of <a href="/wiki/Margin_(finance)#Margin call" id="w">margin calls</a> to provide additional <a href="/wiki/Collateral_(finance)" id="w">collateral</a> for these loans. In an effort to prevent Ebbers from having to sell his shares, the WorldCom <a href="/wiki/Board_of_directors" id="w">board of directors</a> authorized a series of loans and loan guarantees between September 2000 and April 2002.</p>
<p>WorldCom announced the resignation of Bernie Ebbers on <a href="/wiki/April_30" id="w">April 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>. As part of his departure, Ebbers&#39; loans were consolidated into a single $408.2 million promissory note.</p>
<a id="Personal_holdings" name="Personal_holdings"></a><h3>Personal holdings</h3>
<p>At his peak in early 1999, Ebbers was worth an estimated $1.4 billion and listed at number 174 on the <a href="/wiki/Forbes_400" id="w">Forbes 400</a>. His personal holdings included:<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>

<a id="Other_activities" name="Other_activities"></a><h3>Other activities</h3>
<p>Bernard Ebbers served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Competitive Telecommunications Association from 1993 through 1995. In 1997 he then became the chair for Mississippi College&#39;s New Dawn Campaign, a fund raising effort initially intended to provide $80 million that raised its goal to $100 million. In July 2001, Ebbers was proposed as the chair for the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President</a>&#39;s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Personality" name="Personality"></a><h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dubbed the <i>Telecom Cowboy</i>,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Ebbers was known for his unorthodox style. Instead of the typical corporate uniform he often wore boots and blue jeans. His direct style of speech, typified by such comments as: </p>

<ul>
<li>following the announcement of WorldCom&#39;s unsolicited bid for MCI when he joked that then MCI CEO Bert C. Roberts Jr. should be in the office &#34;a little bit earlier.&#34;</li>
<li>during his trial &#34;I know what I don&#39;t know.&#34; and &#34;I don&#39;t know technology and engineering. I don&#39;t know accounting.&#34;</li></ul>
<p>Ebbers&#39; personal faith was another important factor in his personality.
While CEO of WorldCom, he was a member of the Easthaven Baptist Church in <a href="/wiki/Brookhaven%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Brookhaven</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mississippi" id="w">Mississippi</a>. As a high-profile member of the congregation, Ebbers regularly taught Sunday School and attended the morning Worship service with his family. His Christian faith was overt, and he often started corporate meetings with prayer.<sup id="_ref-CNNMoney_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNNMoney" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>When the allegations of conspiracy and fraud were first brought to light in 2002, Ebbers addressed the congregation and insisted on his innocence. &#34;I just want you to know you aren&#39;t going to church with a crook,&#34; he said, &#34;No one will find me to have knowingly committed fraud.&#34;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Post-WorldCom" name="Post-WorldCom"></a><h2> Post-WorldCom </h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/June_25" id="w">June 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a> announcement by WorldCom of $3.85 billion, a figure that would grow to $11 billion, in accounting misstatements caused a series of investigations and legal proceedings to commence. Ebbers, being the CEO of WorldCom during the time the inflated earnings occurred, was a major figure in these investigations and legal proceedings.</p>
<a id="Congressional_hearing" name="Congressional_hearing"></a><h3> Congressional hearing </h3>
<p>In response to a <a href="/wiki/Subpoena" id="w">subpoena</a>, Ebbers appeared before the <a href="/wiki/U.S._House_Committee_on_Financial_Services" id="w">U.S. House Committee on Financial Services</a> on <a href="/wiki/July_8" id="w">July 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>.

<p>Following his actions, Ebbers was threatened with <a href="/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress" id="w">Contempt of Congress</a> charges.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>  The basis of the allegation was that Ebbers&#39; statement constituted <a href="/wiki/Testimony" id="w">testimony</a> that could not be <a href="/wiki/Cross-examination" id="w">cross-examined</a>. No charge of contempt was ever filed.</p>
