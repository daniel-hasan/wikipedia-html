<b>The Reputation</b> were an <a href="/wiki/Indie_rock" id="w">indie rock</a> band from <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a>. The band was fronted by former <a href="/wiki/Sarge_(band)" id="w">Sarge</a> <a href="/wiki/Singer-songwriter" id="w">singer-songwriter</a> <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Elmore" id="w">Elizabeth Elmore</a>, with other positions filled by various members.</p>
<p>The band, which formed while Elmore was attending <a href="/wiki/Law_school" id="w">law school</a>, released two albums between the years of 2001 and 2006, both of which were met with generally positive reviews. The band has toured the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the disbanding of her old band, <a href="/wiki/Sarge_(band)" id="w">Sarge</a>, Elmore enrolled in law school at <a href="/wiki/Northwestern_University" id="w">Northwestern University</a>.<sup id="_ref-AversionSchild_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AversionSchild" title="">[1]</a></sup> She embarked on a series of solo tours between classes, but after growing tired of performing solo Elmore recruited ex-Sarge drummer Russ Horvath and ex-Chisel bassist and law school classmate Chris Norborg to tour with. The group toured together and recorded a five song <a href="/wiki/Demo_(music)" id="w">demo</a>, but after a while Horvath and Norborg were no longer able to tour due to schooling. Elmore recruited friend and ex-Moreno guitarist Sean Hulet, ex-Moreno drummer Scott Rosenquist, and ex-Andiamo bassist Joel Root. The new group completed a tour of the East Coast.<sup id="_ref-AversionSchild_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AversionSchild" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Elmore requested a <a href="/wiki/Leave_of_absence" id="w">leave of absence</a> from Northwestern Law School in 2001 to focus on the band. After ex-Nymb drummer Ben Kane replaced the unavailable Rosenquist, the group signed to <a href="/wiki/Initial_Records" id="w">Initial Records</a>. Kane left the band, and former Sarge drummer Chad Romanski joined the group after several weeks of Elmore begging. The band completed a fall West Coast tour and began recording their debut album with Romanski.<sup id="_ref-RepOffBio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RepOffBio" title="">[2]</a></sup> The band took on the name The Reputation at this time, a reference, according to Elmore, intended to be a &#34;personal little &#39;fuck you&#39;&#34; aimed at certain members within the indie music scene who promoted &#34;endless speculation&#34; about Elmore&#39;s sex life.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Self-titled_debut" name="Self-titled_debut"></a><h3>Self-titled debut</h3>

<p><i>The Reputation</i>, the band&#39;s self-titled debut album, was released in 2002 after the band spent much of the fall and winter of 2001 in the recording studio.<sup id="_ref-RepOffBio_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RepOffBio" title="">[2]</a></sup> The majority of the album was recorded in Chicago at Atlas, with the exception of a cover of <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Costello" id="w">Elvis Costello</a>&#39;s song &#34;Almost Blue,&#34; which was recorded with then-<a href="/wiki/Wilco" id="w">Wilco</a> guitarist <a href="/wiki/Jay_Bennett" id="w">Jay Bennett</a> on piano and production duties, as well as extra arrangements and recording on other tracks.<sup id="_ref-STLiners_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-STLiners" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Elmore, as she did with her work in Sarge, wrote all of the original songs and lyrics, and assisted with the production along with Matt Allison.<sup id="_ref-STLiners_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-STLiners" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The album was well received critically. The <i><a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" id="w">Los Angeles Times</a></i> gave the album 3.5 out of 4 stars, with reviewer Kevin Bronson saying that &#34;[Elmore&#39;s] streaming anecdotes give the listener the feeling of walking right into the middle of life-altering events.&#34;<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The <i><a href="/wiki/College_Music_Journal" id="w">College Music Journal</a><b>s Amy Wan called the album a &#34;showcase for Elmore&#39;s powerfully biting lyrics and her passionate voice, dancing deftly between little-girl sweet and outright roar,&#34;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> and The <i><a href="/wiki/Village_Voice" id="w">Village Voice</a></i> gave the album an A-, with famed <a href="/wiki/Music_journalist" id="w">music journalist</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_Christgau" id="w">Robert Christgau</a> praising the debut, saying that &#34;Elmore left a great band to go to law school. Now she leaves a great law school to start a better band.&#34;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>Along with the positive feedback for the album, the band was able to secure its first permanent drummer in Matt Espy.<sup id="_ref-RepOffBio_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RepOffBio" title="">[2]</a></sup>  The band would tour the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and parts of <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> a number of times following the release of the album.<sup id="_ref-RepTourDates_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RepTourDates" title="">[8]</a></sup>  Along with the performance agenda in 2003, Elmore balanced touring, songwriting for their next album, and a return to law school while the band suffered the loss of yet another drummer, as Espy was forced to leave after a tenure of nearly a year and a half for personal reasons.<sup id="_ref-RepOffBio_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RepOffBio" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="''To_Force_a_Fate''" name="''To_Force_a_Fate''"></a><h3>&#39;&#39;To Force a Fate&#39;&#39;</h3>

<p>The band settled on their second permanent drummer, Steve Van Horn, shortly after Espy left following their round of touring. At the same time, the band began negotiations with <a href="/wiki/Lookout!_Records" id="w">Lookout! Records</a> to release their follow-up. After a marathon run of shows and songwriting toward the end of 2003, the band recorded their second album.<sup id="_ref-RepOffBio_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RepOffBio" title="">[2]</a></sup>  The sessions were difficult, with 14 hour recording days being balanced with Elmore attempting to finish remaining law school papers, combined with weekend tour jaunts to the East Coast.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> The album was unique compared to other Elmore projects in that other members of the band assisted in the songwriting process.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>To Force a Fate</i> was ultimately released in April 2004 on Lookout! Records.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The album received generally positive press, including favorable reviews in <i><a href="/wiki/Spin_Magazine" id="w">Spin Magazine</a></i>, calling the album &#34;a bang of <a href="/wiki/Power-pop" id="w">power-pop</a> epiphany.&#34;<sup id="_ref-press_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-press" title="">[12]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Blender_Magazine" id="w">Blender Magazine</a></i> gave the album four stars, stating that &#34;Elizabeth Elmore, a law-school graduate with boy trouble to match her student loans, writes songs that are as much legal briefs as diary entries.&#34;<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" id="w">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> called the album &#34;muscular yet lush,&#34; and gave the album a B+.<sup id="_ref-press_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-press" title="">[12]</a></sup> The album would eventually reach #58 on the CMJ charts.<sup id="_ref-RepOffBio_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RepOffBio" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Post-album_touring" name="Post-album_touring"></a><h3>Post-album touring</h3>
<p>The band spent 2004 and 2005 touring the United States for over nine months, including opening slots for <a href="/wiki/Ted_Leo_and_the_Pharmacists" id="w">Ted Leo and the Pharmacists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grammy" id="w">Grammy</a> nominees <a href="/wiki/The_Killers_(band)" id="w">The Killers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Modest_Mouse" id="w">Modest Mouse</a>, <a href="/wiki/Death_Cab_for_Cutie" id="w">Death Cab for Cutie</a>, and <a href="/wiki/The_Donnas" id="w">the Donnas</a>.<sup id="_ref-RepTourDates_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RepTourDates" title="">[8]</a></sup> The band&#39;s performance at <a href="/wiki/South_by_Southwest" id="w">South by Southwest</a> in particular was covered positively in <i><a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" id="w">Entertainment Weekly</a>.</i><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>2005 took the band overseas to tour the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> for the first time, as well as two separate two-month United States tours. In June of 2005, bassist Joel Root left the band for personal reasons. They completed their summer tour with Stereo South bassist Greg Mytych,<sup id="_ref-RepTourDates_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RepTourDates" title="">[8]</a></sup> and planned to record a new album in 2006, but came to a halt due to mitigating factors, including the issues with Lookout! Records.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>  Elmore, in November of 2006, posted a message to the band&#39;s official mailing list noting that the band had dissolved and no further plans had been announced.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Drummer Steve Van Horn has joined former Chicagoan and current Austin, TX based singer/songwriter <a href="/wiki/Che_Arthur" id="w">Che Arthur</a>&#39;s touring band.</p>
