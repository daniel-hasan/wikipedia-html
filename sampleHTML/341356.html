<p>The <b>music of the Lesser Antilles</b> encompasses the <a href="/wiki/Music" id="w">music</a> of this chain of small islands making up the eastern and southern portion of the <a href="/wiki/West_Indies" id="w">West Indies</a>. <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Antilles" id="w">Lesser Antillean</a> music is part of the broader category of <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_music" id="w">Caribbean music</a>; much of the <a href="/wiki/Folk_music" id="w">folk</a> and <a href="/wiki/Popular_music" id="w">popular music</a> is also a part of the <a href="/wiki/Afro-American_music" id="w">Afro-American musical</a> complex, being a mixture of African, European and indigenous American elements. The Lesser Antilles&#39; musical cultures are largely based on the music of <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade" id="w">African slaves</a> brought by European traders and colonizers. The <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Africa" id="w">African musical</a> elements are a hybrid of instruments and styles from numerous <a href="/wiki/West_Africa" id="w">West African</a> tribes, while the European slaveholders added their own musics into the mix, as did immigrants from <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>. In many ways, the Lesser Antilles can be musically divided based on which nation colonized them.</p>
<p>The ex-<a href="/wiki/British_colonization_of_the_Americas" id="w">British colonies</a> include <a href="/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago" id="w">Trinidad and Tobago</a>, whose <a href="/wiki/Calypso_music" id="w">calypso</a> style is an especially potent part of the music of the other former British colonies, which also share traditions like the <a href="/wiki/Big_Drum" id="w">Big Drum</a> dance.  The <a href="/wiki/French_colonial_empires" id="w">French islands</a> of Martinique and Guadeloupe share the popular <i><a href="/wiki/Zouk" id="w">zouk</a></i> style and have also had extensive musical contact with the <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Haiti" id="w">music of Haiti</a>, itself once a French colony though not part of the Lesser Antilles. The <a href="/wiki/Dutch_colonization_of_the_Americas" id="w">Dutch colonies</a> of <a href="/wiki/Cura%C3%A7ao" id="w">Curaçao</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bonaire" id="w">Bonaire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aruba" id="w">Aruba</a> share the <a href="/wiki/Combined_rhythm" id="w">combined rhythm</a> popular style. The islands also share a passion for <a href="/wiki/Kaseko" id="w">kaseko</a>, a genre of <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Suriname" id="w">Surinamese music</a>; Suriname and its neighbors <a href="/wiki/Guyana" id="w">Guyana</a> and <a href="/wiki/French_Guiana" id="w">French Guiana</a> share folk and popular styles that are connected enough to the Antilles and other Caribbean islands that both countries are studied in the broader context of Antillean or Caribbean music.</p>
<a id="Characteristics" name="Characteristics"></a><h1>Characteristics</h1>
<p>While Lesser Antillean music is very often discussed as a <a href="/wiki/Music_area" id="w">music area</a>, this division is of limited usefulness. The islands of the Lesser Antilles divide musically along linguistic lines, with the most significant overlap coming from <a href="/wiki/Dominica" id="w">Dominica</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saint_Lucia" id="w">Saint Lucia</a>, both primarily <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_English" id="w">Anglophone</a> but strongly influenced by a French colonial past. Because the islands are divided linguistically, the term <i>Antillean music</i> is usually used in reference to one such music area. Thus, for example, the <i>Rough Guide to World Music</i> features a chapter on &#34;Antillean music&#34;, which is entirely about the French Antillean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, with a brief sidebar specifically about the Dutch Antilles. </p>
<p>In the context of Anglophone music, the term <i>Antillean music</i> most commonly refers to <a href="/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago" id="w">Trinidad and Tobago</a>, home to the well-known calypso style. Music author Peter Manuel, for example, treats all the Anglophone islands as a subject of Trinidadian calypso traditions, while using the title <i>Music of the Lesser Antilles</i> for Francophone Antillean music. Manuel also, like many authors, treats Suriname and Guyana as integral aspects of Caribbean music; due to the Dutch colonial history of both countries, they are often grouped with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Antillean music can be characterized by the prominence of the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Carnival" id="w">Carnival</a> celebration (prominently from <a href="/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago" id="w">Trinidad and Tobago</a>), and the importance of calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the prominence of Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>, where <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn" id="w">Brooklyn</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Labor_Day_Carnival" id="w">Labor Day Carnival</a> features music and parades, mas and <a href="/wiki/Steelpan" id="w">steel bands</a>; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>{{see}}</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Calypso_music" id="w">Calypso</a> is most closely associated with the island of <a href="/wiki/Trinidad" id="w">Trinidad</a>, but it has spread throughout the Lesser Antilles, and abroad. Similar traditions can be found natively on many of Caribbean islands. Within the Antilles, most of the popular calypso stars have come from <a href="/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago" id="w">Trinidad and Tobago</a>; the majority of the exceptions, such as <a href="/wiki/Arrow_(musician)" id="w">Arrow</a> from Montserrat, have come from other Anglophone islands. Music author Peter Manuel has argued that, despite the modern Anglophone focus to calypso-like song forms, their origins lie in the &#34;Afro-French creole culture&#34;, and notes that the ancestor of the word <i>calypso</i>, <i>cariso</i>, was first used to refer to a Martinican singer.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The calypso song complex is characterized by <a href="/wiki/Satire" id="w">satirical</a>, political, risque and humorous lyricism, a competitive and celebratory nature and its function in social organization and informal communication. Jamaican <i><a href="/wiki/Mento" id="w">mento</a></i> is perhaps the most well-known form of calypso-like music. The island of <a href="/wiki/Carriacou" id="w">Carriacou</a> is home to a calypso-like song style, as well as <a href="/wiki/Canboulay" id="w">canboulay</a> feasts, <a href="/wiki/Calinda" id="w">calinda</a> songs and steel bands, all similar to though distinct from the related Trinidadian traditions. Modern influences from Trinidad have organized the Carriacou song style, and there are competitions similar to <a href="/wiki/Calypso_tent" id="w">calypso tents</a> on the island.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The Antiguan <a href="/wiki/Benna" id="w">benna</a> is part of the same song complex, featuring news-oriented and ribald, often satirical lyrics and a rhythmic, uptempo style.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Annual <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Carnival" id="w">Carnival</a> celebrations are an important part of the culture of all the Lesser Antillean islands. Carnival is celebrated at varying times of year, either pre-<a href="/wiki/Lent" id="w">Lent</a>, <a href="/wiki/Christmas" id="w">Christmastime</a> or in July and August, and feature a wide variety of dances, songs and parades. Contests are common, especially Calypso King and Queen contests, which are held on most of the British Antillean islands, the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Virgin_Islands" id="w">U.S. Virgin Islands</a> as well as French <a href="/wiki/Saint_Martin" id="w">Saint Martin</a> and elsewhere. The British Antillean Carnivals are also mostly united by the <a href="/wiki/J%26%2339%3Bouvert" id="w">J&#39;ouvert</a> tradition, which involves calypso and <a href="/wiki/Soca_music" id="w">soca</a> band parades and are the highlight of their celebrations.</p>
<p>Summer Carnivals include those on <a href="/wiki/Antigua" id="w">Antigua</a>, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, <a href="/wiki/Sint_Eustatius" id="w">Sint Eustatius</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saint_John%2C_U.S._Virgin_Islands" id="w">Saint John</a>, Saint Lucia, Grenada, <a href="/wiki/Saba" id="w">Saba</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nevis" id="w">Nevis</a> and Anguilla, the latter two of which are especially known for popular calypso competitions. Christmastime Carnivals are held on Montserrat, <a href="/wiki/Saint_Croix%2C_U.S._Virgin_Islands" id="w">Saint Croix</a>, Saint Martin and <a href="/wiki/Saint_Kitts" id="w">Saint Kitts</a>; Montserrat&#39;s distinctive Carnival includes <a href="/wiki/Masquerade" id="w">masquerades</a> and steelbands, and both islands also feature calypso competitions. The Carnival of Sint Maarten, which takes place a month after <a href="/wiki/Easter" id="w">Easter</a>, is known for the burning of King Moui-Moui as the culmination of the festival. Many islands, especially the French and Dutch Antilles, are home to pre-Lenten Carnivals, including Martinique, Aruba, <a href="/wiki/Saint-Barth%C3%A9lemy" id="w">Saint-Barthélemy</a>, Bonaire, Curaçao, Dominica, <a href="/wiki/Saint_Thomas%2C_U.S._Virgin_Islands" id="w">Saint Thomas</a> and Guadeloupe.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>There are many popular traditions common to the English-speaking islands of the Lesser Antilles. <a href="/wiki/Calypso_music" id="w">Calypso</a>, originally from the island of <a href="/wiki/Trinidad" id="w">Trinidad</a>, has spread to the neighboring islands; other Trinidadian popular traditions, like <a href="/wiki/Soca_music" id="w">soca</a>, are also well-known throughout the region. <a href="/wiki/Steelpan" id="w">Steel drum</a> ensembles is also found throughout the English-speaking Lesser Antilles (and abroad), especially in Trinidad and Tobago as well as Antigua and Barbuda. The British Antilles also share in certain folk traditions. Trinidadian folk calypso is found throughout the area, as are African-Caribbean religious music styles like the <a href="/wiki/Shango" id="w">Shango</a> music of Trinidad.<sup id="_ref-Manuel183_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Manuel183" title="">[8]</a></sup>  Variants of the <a href="/wiki/Big_Drum" id="w">Big Drum</a> festival occur throughout the <a href="/wiki/Windward_Islands" id="w">Windward Islands</a>, especially in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Carnival is an important folk music celebration on all the islands of the Lesser Antilles, and the rest of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Calypso is part of a spectrum of similar folk and popular Caribbean styles that spans <a href="/wiki/Benna" id="w">benna</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mento" id="w">mento</a>, but remains the most prominent genre of Lesser Antillean music. Calypso&#39;s roots are  somewhat unclear, but we know it can be traced to 18th-century <a href="/wiki/Trinidad" id="w">Trinidad</a>. Modern calypso, however, began in the 19th century, a fusion of disparate elements ranging from the <a href="/wiki/Masquerade" id="w">masquerade</a> song <i><a href="/wiki/Lavway" id="w">lavway</a></i>, French Creole <i><a href="/wiki/Belair_(dance)" id="w">belair</a></i> and the <a href="/wiki/Stick_fighting" id="w">stick fighting</a> <a href="/wiki/Chantwell" id="w">chantwell</a>. Calypso&#39;s early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by <a href="/wiki/Trinidadian" id="w">Trinidadian</a> slaves, including <a href="/wiki/Camboulay" id="w">camboulay</a> drumming and the music masquerade processions. Popular calypso arose in the early 20th century, with the rise of internationally known <a href="/wiki/Calypsonian" id="w">calypsonians</a> like <a href="/wiki/Attila_the_Hun_(calypsonian)" id="w">Attila the Hun</a><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>  and <a href="/wiki/Roaring_Lion" id="w">Roaring Lion</a>.<sup id="_ref-Manuel183_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Manuel183" title="">[8]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Trinidadian" id="w">Trinidadian</a> calypso remained popular throughout the Caribbean in the later 20th century, and other Antillean islands like <a href="/wiki/Antigua" id="w">Antigua</a> began producing calypso stars. In the 1970s, a calypso variant called <a href="/wiki/Soca_music" id="w">soca</a> arose, characterized by a focus on dance rhythms rather than lyricism. Soca has since spread across the Caribbean and abroad.<sup id="_ref-Manuel183_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Manuel183" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Steel drums are a distinctively <a href="/wiki/Trinidadian" id="w">Trinidadian</a> ensemble that evolved from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions. By the late 1930s, <a href="/wiki/Bamboo" id="w">bamboo</a> tubes, a traditional instrumental, were supplemented by pieces of metal used percussively; over time, these metal percussion instruments were pitched to produce as many as twenty-some tones. Steel bands were large orchestras of these drums, and were banned by the British colonial authorities. Nevertheless, steel drums spread across the Caribbean, and are now an entrenched part of the culture of <a href="/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago" id="w">Trinidad and Tobago</a>.<sup id="_ref-Manuel183_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Manuel183" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

The quadrille is a potent symbol of French Antillean culture.<sup id="_ref-Manuel140_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Manuel140" title="">[11]</a></sup>  Martinique and Guadeloupe are also home to their own distinct folk traditions, most influentially including Guadeloupan <i><a href="/wiki/Gwo_ka" id="w">gwo ka</a></i> and Martinican <i><a href="/wiki/Tambour" id="w">tambour</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Twi_ba" id="w">twi ba</a></i>. <i>Gwo ka</i> is a type of percussion music which consists of seven basic rhythms and variations on them. It has been modernized into <i><a href="/wiki/Gwo_ka_moderne" id="w">gwo ka moderne</a></i>, though traditional rural performances (<i><a href="/wiki/Lewoz" id="w">lewoz</a></i>) are still common.<sup id="_ref-WorldMusic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WorldMusic" title="">[12]</a></sup> Tambour and twi ba ensembles are the origin of several important Martinican popular styles, including <i><a href="/wiki/Chouval_bwa" id="w">chouval bwa</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Biguine" id="w">biguine</a></i>, and also exterted an influence on zouk.

Folk <a href="/wiki/Storytelling" id="w">storytelling</a> (<i>kont</i>) and songs (<i>b&#233;l&#233;</i>) are also a major part of the country&#39;s musical identity.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Music authors Charles De Ledesma and Gene Scaramuzzo trace zouk&#39;s development to the Guadeloupan gwo ka and Martinican <i>tambour</i> and <i>twi ba</i> folk traditions. Ethnomusicologist Jocelyn Guilbault, however, describes zouk as a synthesis of Caribbean popular styles, especially <a href="/wiki/Cadence-lypso" id="w">cadence-lypso</a>, <i>biguine</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Kompa_direk" id="w">kompa direk</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Kadans_rampa" id="w">kadans rampa</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Zouk arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s, using elements of previous styles of Antillean music, as well as imported genres. In the 1950s, Haitian <a href="/wiki/Compas" id="w">compas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cadence_rampa" id="w">cadence rampa</a> became the dominant pop sounds of the Lesser Antilles, especially <a href="/wiki/Webert_Sicot" id="w">Webert Sicot</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nemours_Jean_Baptiste" id="w">Nemours Jean Baptiste</a>. These were followed by the Antillean <a href="/wiki/Mini-jazz" id="w">mini-jazz</a> bands like <a href="/wiki/Les_Gentlemen" id="w">Les Gentlemen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Les_Leopards" id="w">Les Leopards</a> and <a href="/wiki/Les_Vikings_de_Guadeloupe" id="w">Les Vikings de Guadeloupe</a> in the late 1970s, who drew on the Haitian sound of Sicot and Baptiste. Later in the decade and into the 1980s, the French Antilles became home to a style of cadence music called cadence-lypso. <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Henderson" id="w">Gordon Henderson</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Exile_One" id="w">Exile One</a> innovated this style by adding calypso <a href="/wiki/Horn_section" id="w">horns</a>, and turned the mini-jazz combos into guitar-dominated big bands, paving the way for the success of large groups like <a href="/wiki/Malavoi" id="w">Malavoi</a>, among others. Drawing on these influences, the supergroup <a href="/wiki/Kassav%26%2339%3B" id="w">Kassav&#39;</a> invented zouk and popularized it with hit songs like &#34;Zouk-La-Se Sel Medikaman Nou Ni&#34;. Kassav&#39; formed from Paris in 1978. Kassav&#39; soon added elements of <a href="/wiki/Rock_music" id="w">rock</a> and other influences and became some of the biggest stars in the Caribbean, France and elsewhere as zouk diversified into multiple subgenres. These include <a href="/wiki/Zouk-love" id="w">zouk-love</a>, pop ballads by artists like <a href="/wiki/Edith_Lefel" id="w">Edith Lefel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gilles_Floro" id="w">Gilles Floro</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Zouk_funk" id="w">zouk funk</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ragga-zouk" id="w">ragga-zouk</a> bands like <a href="/wiki/Lord_Kossity" id="w">Lord Kossity</a> who fused the genre with other influences.<sup id="_ref-WorldMusic_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WorldMusic" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though zouk is the most well-known form of modern French Antillean music, the island of Martinique has also produced the <i>chouval bwa</i> and <i>biguine</i> styles, which were especially popular in the early 20th century. Chouval bwa is includes multiple distinctive instruments and internationally famous performers like <a href="/wiki/Claude_Germany" id="w">Claude Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dede_Saint-Prix" id="w">Dede Saint-Prix</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pakatak" id="w">Pakatak</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tumpak" id="w">Tumpak</a>, while biguine has achieved international fame since the 1920s and has since been modernized and adapted for pop audiences, making it a major influence on zouk.<sup id="_ref-WorldMusic_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WorldMusic" title="">[12]</a></sup> Between the 1930s and 1950s, the dance <i>biguine</i> was popular among the islands&#39; dance orchestras. The <i>biguine</i> uses a <i>cinquillo</i> variant related to that found in other Caribbean genres like <i>mereng</i> and <i>kompa direk</i>.

Instrumentation for the <i>tambu</i> uses the <i>agan</i>, <i>chapi</i>, <a href="/wiki/Triangle_(instrument)" id="w">triangle</a>, <i>wiri</i> and other instruments, many of which are also part of the African-derived <i>muziek di zumbi</i>, or <i>spirit music</i>, of Curaçao.<sup id="_ref-NewGrove_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NewGrove" title="">[18]</a></sup> Curaçao&#39;s folk music also includes a rich tradition of <a href="/wiki/Work_song" id="w">work songs</a> with apentatonic lyrics sung in <a href="/wiki/Guene_language" id="w">Guene</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Papiamento" id="w">Papiamento</a> variant called <i>seshi</i>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Simadan" id="w">Simadan</a> harvest festival is found across the islands, and features the <i>cachu</i> trumpet, made from a cowhorn. Bonaire&#39;s Simadan festival is also notable for the use of the <i>becu</i>, an aerophone made from the stalk of a <a href="/wiki/Sorghum" id="w">sorghum</a> plant, and the <i>kinkon</i>, made from a <a href="/wiki/Conch" id="w">conch</a> shell and known elsewhere as the <i>carco</i>. Folk song forms range from the harvest <i>seu</i>, <i>simadan</i> and <i>wapa</i>. Other songs were imported beginning in the 19th century, including the South American <i><a href="/wiki/Joropo" id="w">joropo</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Pasillo" id="w">pasillo</a></i>, Spanish Caribbean <i><a href="/wiki/Merengue_music" id="w">merengue</a></i> and other new songs, dances and instruments. This diverse mixture was the origin of the Dutch Antilles&#39; most distinctive and long-standing popular tradition, the <i><a href="/wiki/Tumba" id="w">tumba</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-NewGrove_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NewGrove" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The smaller islands of Saint Martin, Saba and Sint Eustatius largely share in the same folk instruments, dances and songs as their neighbors; however, these islands remain largely unstudied. Saba is home to a vital percussive music tradition, most closely associated with private parties, using instrumentation similar to Curacau, Bonaire and Aruba. Saint Martin is home to a national dance form called the <i><a href="/wiki/Ponum" id="w">ponum</a></i>, which dates to the 19th century and was only displaced by string bands in the mid-20th century. Saint Martin is also home to a calypso-like <i><a href="/wiki/Quimbe" id="w">quimbe</a></i> song form, that remains a major part of the island&#39;s culture.<sup id="_ref-NewGrove_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NewGrove" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
