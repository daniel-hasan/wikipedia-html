<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h2>Plot</h2>
<p>{{Plot}}
<a href="/wiki/John_McClane" id="w">John McClane</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Detective" id="w">detective</a> with the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department" id="w">New York City Police Department</a>, arrives in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" id="w">Los Angeles</a> to attempt a <a href="/wiki/Christmas" id="w">Christmas</a> reunion with his estranged wife Holly. He is taken by <a href="/wiki/Limousine" id="w">limousine</a> driver Argyle to her workplace, the <a href="/wiki/High-rise" id="w">high-rise</a> Nakatomi Plaza. While Argyle waits in the building&#39;s parking garage, McClane joins the Nakatomi Christmas party, where he meets Holly&#39;s boss Joseph Takagi and sleazy co-woker Ellis. He finally finds Holly and they immediately get into an argument over her use of her maiden name Gennaro. Holly leaves McClane in a small room near the party, where he removes his shoes and socks and makes &#34;fists&#34; with his toes (a suggested <a href="/wiki/Jet_lag" id="w">jet lag</a> remedy from a fellow passenger on his flight into the city).</p>
<p>A gang led by the suave and refined German <a href="/wiki/Terrorist" id="w">terrorist</a> Hans Gruber invades and secures the building, under the pretence of gaining the release of various terrorist operatives. The party-goers are subdued and it is revealed that the group are actually thieves; their plan is to use the false terrorist crisis to cover their theft of millions of dollars in <a href="/wiki/Bearer_bond" id="w">bearer bonds</a> from the building&#39;s security vault. When Takagi refuses to provide the vault combination, he is killed and Theo, the gang&#39;s technical mastermind, begins disabling the sequential vault locks, warning Gruber that the final <a href="/wiki/Electro-magnetic" id="w">electro-magnetic</a> based lock will be impossible to bypass. </p>
<p>McClane manages to slip away during the round-up of the party-goers, luckily having brought his police-issue weapon. His attempt to summon help via the building&#39;s fire alarm brings him into confrontation with gang member Tony. A fight ensues and both men tumble down a flight of stairs. Tony breaks his neck in the fall, prompting the man&#39;s vengeful brother, Karl, to lead a hunt for the police officer throughout the building. McClane arms himself with Tony&#39;s machine gun and radio and manages to convince a skeptical 911 operator to send a patrol unit to Nakatomi. He secures the attention of responding <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department" id="w">Los Angeles Police Department</a> officer Al Powell by dropping the body of one of his pursuers onto the hood of the officer&#39;s car. He also takes a collection of <a href="/wiki/C4_explosives" id="w">C4 explosives</a> and detonators off the body of another gangmember. </p>
<p><div style="wigth:150px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:150px-Foxplazaupclose.jpg" title="Nakatomi Plaza (in real life, the [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]])."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/150px-Foxplazaupclose.jpg" alt="Nakatomi Plaza (in real life, the [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]])." title="Nakatomi Plaza (in real life, the [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]])." class="location-left type-thumb" width="150px" />

<div class="thumbcaption">Nakatomi Plaza (in real life, the <a href="/wiki/Fox_Plaza_(Los_Angeles)" id="w">Fox Plaza</a>).</div></div>
</p>
<p>The LAPD responds in force, but this merely accelerates Gruber&#39;s timetable. With the police led by the incompetent Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson, Powell quickly proves to be McClane&#39;s only useful ally outside the building. A <a href="/wiki/SWAT" id="w">SWAT</a> team and an armored reconnaissance vehicle are easily and brutally repelled, to which McClane retaliates by bombing two of Gruber&#39;s men along with an entire floor of the building with some of the C4.  The blast unnerves Ellis who reveals McClane&#39;s identity to Gruber with the hopes of negotiating his release. He is murdered when McClane refuses to cooperate.  </p>
<p>An incensed Gruber orders Karl to track McClane down and recover the detonators while Gruber goes up to the roof access, where he finds himself in an unexpected face-to-face confrontation with McClane. Gruber attempts to pass himself off as a hostage; the ruse is distraction enough that Karl and his team surprise McClane in an ambush. McClane kills two more gang-members but is forced to flee, leaving behind the detonators and severely injuring his feet. As he tends his wounds, Powell tells him via radio how, in the past, he had mistakenly shot a child &#34;armed&#34; with a toy gun. His grief had him heading for a career as a desk officer (as he is no longer confident in pulling a gun on anyone).</p>
<p>Outside, the spectacle attracts massive media attention, while the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" id="w">FBI</a> arrives on the scene in the form of Agent Johnson and Agent Johnson. The duo order the building&#39;s power be cut, which serves only to deactivate the final lock on the building&#39;s vault, just as Gruber had planned. He &#34;negotiates&#34; with the FBI to release the hostages on the rooftop via helicopter transport.  The agents plan to double cross the &#34;terrorists&#34; with a surprise attack using gunships (with little regard to the hostages&#39; welfare), while Gruber in fact is planning his own treachery; using the C4 to destroy the entire upper structure of the building, killing all the hostages and covering the gang&#39;s escape.  </p>
<p>McClane investigates the roof access, wondering about Gruber&#39;s earlier presence in that area. He discovers the primed C4 and tries to alert Powell, only to be cut off by an attacking Karl. After a vicious battle, McClane leaves Karl hanging from a heavy chain. Back outside the building, an irresponsible TV reporter named Richard Thornburg accidentally alerts Gruber to the fact that Holly is McClane&#39;s wife. He takes her aside as a special hostage as his remaining men raid the vault and Theo goes to the parking garage to prepare the gang&#39;s getaway <a href="/wiki/Ambulance" id="w">ambulance</a>. Argyle, who has kept up with events via his limo&#39;s radio, rams the vehicle with his limousine and punches Theo unconscious. </p>
<p>McClane storms the roof, driving the hostages back down to safety with warning gunfire. The FBI mistake McClane for a terrorist and fire at him, while Gruber proceeds with the detonation of the C4.  McClane escapes the blast by tying a <a href="/wiki/Fire_hose" id="w">fire hose</a> around his waist, jumping over the side of the building, and shooting his way in through a window a couple of stories down. The gunship crew, including both FBI agents, are killed.</p>
<p>A battered McClane confronts Gruber one last time high up in the tower, with Holly being held at gunpoint. McClane tricks Gruber with a faked surrender and shoots the villain, who falls from the building to his death. As McClane and his wife leave the building, the seemingly-indestructible Karl reappears one last time, only to be gunned down by Powell. Holly and John are approached by Thornburg, still relentlessly angling for a fresh scoop. Holly punches the reporter and the couple departs the scene in Argyle&#39;s battered limo.</p>

<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h2>Production</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Nakatomi building is actually <a href="/wiki/Twentieth_Century_Fox" id="w">Twentieth Century Fox</a> headquarters, and the company charged itself rent for use of the (unfinished) building as if the production were simply another tenant of the building, as well as damages for the destruction of the sidewalk guardrail destroyed by the LAPD armored personnel carrier.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></li></ul> 

<ul>
<li>In the German <a href="/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)" id="w">dub</a>, the names and backgrounds of the German-born terrorists were changed into English forms (mostly into their British equivalents): Hans became Jack, Karl became Charlie, Heinrich turned into Henry <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>. The new background depicts them as Irish terrorists having gone freelance and for profit rather than ideals.{{Fact}} This was because German terrorism (especially by the <a href="/wiki/Rote_Armee_Fraktion" id="w">Rote Armee Fraktion</a>) was still considered a sensitive issue by the German government in the 1980s.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>According to commentary from the movie&#39;s DVD release, Alan Rickman&#39;s surprise when Gruber is dropped from the building is genuine: the director chose to release Rickman a full second before he expected it in order to get genuine surprise, a move which angered Rickman. The text commentary track also reveals that the shooting script did not originally feature the meeting between McClane and Gruber pretending to be a hostage; it was only written in when it was discovered that Rickman could do an American accent.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Whenever Gruber fires his weapon, the scene cuts away. McTiernan did this to avoid showing Rickman&#39;s involuntary habit of flinching when the gun recoiled.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li><i>Die Hard</i> was renamed <i>Big Building Fight</i> in Thailand. In Spain, it was renamed <i>La Jungla de Cristal</i> (<i>The Glass Jungle</i>). In Latin America it was renamed <i>Duro de Matar</i> (<i>Hard to Kill</i>). In Russia film was named <i>Крепкий Орешек</i> (<i>A Hard Nut to Crack</i>). In Poland it was named <i>Szklana Pułapka</i> (<i>The Glass Trap</i>). In Portugal it was named <i>Assalto ao Arranha-Céus </i> (<i>Assault to the Skyscraper</i>). In Norway it was named <i>Aksjon Skyskraper</i> at first, but was later changed to its original name. In France, it was named <i>Piège de Cristal</i> (<i>The Crystal Trap</i>). In Yugoslavia, the film was named <i>Umri Muški</i> (<i>Die like a Man</i>). In Romania, it was renamed &#34;Greu de ucis&#34; (&#34;Hard To Kill&#34;, like the Latin American title). In Finland, the film was named &#34;Vain kuolleen ruumiini yli&#34; (&#34;Only over my dead body&#34;). In Germany, the title was &#34;Stirb langsam&#34; (&#34;Die slowly&#34;). The Hungarian title was &#34;Drágán add az életed&#34; (&#34;Pay them hardly for your life&#34;).</li></ul>
<a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h2>Music</h2>
<p>Though composer <a href="/wiki/Michael_Kamen" id="w">Michael Kamen</a> is credited for scoring the film, the conclusion at the bottom of Nakatomi Plaza where the character Karl reappears with a <a href="/wiki/Steyr_AUG" id="w">Steyr AUG</a> rifle, only to be killed by a very surprised Sergeant Powell, features a cut from the 1986 sci-fi action movie <a href="/wiki/Aliens_(film)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Aliens&#39;&#39;</a> composed by <a href="/wiki/James_Horner" id="w">James Horner</a>. The music can be found on the Aliens soundtrack titled &#34;Resolution and Hyperspace&#34;. Both <i>Die Hard</i> and <i>Aliens</i> are released through <a href="/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" id="w">Twentieth Century Fox</a>.</p>
<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h2>Reception</h2>
<p>When <i>Die Hard</i> was released, it was considered one of the best action films of its era. This is probably in part due to the fact that there are few <i>artificial</i> <a href="/wiki/Plot_point" id="w">plot points</a> in the story. It is noted for including humor as a complement to the action and dramatic elements of the story.  It is said to have reinvented the action genre and set the stage for 90s action/thriller movies such as <i><a href="/wiki/Under_Siege" id="w">Under Siege</a>,</i> <i><a href="/wiki/Passenger_57" id="w">Passenger 57</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Speed_(film)" id="w">Speed</a></i>.  &#34;<i>Die Hard</i> on a _____&#34; became a common way to describe the plot of many of the action films that came in its wake. For example, for the 1990s action flick, <i>Speed,</i> was called &#34;<i>Die Hard</i> on a bus&#34;<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The movie was also responsible for creating the &#34;action star&#34; archetype that is a far more fallible and human hero, wearing few pieces of clothing, speaking few words (including &#34;<a href="/wiki/One-liners" id="w">one-liners</a>&#34;) and always having a rough look across their face.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> <i>Die Hard</i> grossed $80,707,729 at the U.S. Box Office.<sup id="_ref-yahoodiehard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-yahoodiehard" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It was highly acclaimed by critics<sup id="_ref-rottentomatoes_diehard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rottentomatoes_diehard" title="">[7]</a></sup> and spawned three popular sequels: <i><a href="/wiki/Die_Hard_2" id="w">Die Hard 2</a></i> (1990), <i><a href="/wiki/Die_Hard_with_a_Vengeance" id="w">Die Hard with a Vengeance</a></i> (1995) and <i><a href="/wiki/Live_Free_or_Die_Hard" id="w">Live Free or Die Hard</a></i> (2007), all featuring Willis as McClane.</p>
<p><i>Die Hard</i> was listed at #39 on the <a href="/wiki/AFI%26%2339%3Bs_100_Years..._100_Thrills" id="w">AFI&#39;s 100 Years... 100 Thrills</a> list of the most thrilling American movies of all time in 2001.</p>
<p>In 2003, Hans Gruber was listed at #46 on the <a href="/wiki/AFI%26%2339%3Bs_100_Years..._100_Heroes_and_Villains" id="w">AFI&#39;s 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains</a> special.</p>
<p>John McClane&#39;s infamous line &#34;Yippee ki yay, motherfucker&#34; was voted as #96 of &#34;The 100 Greatest Movie Lines&#34; by <a href="/wiki/Premiere_(magazine)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Premiere&#39;&#39; magazine</a> in 2007.</p>
