<p><b>Josephus</b> (<a href="/wiki/37" id="w">37</a> – sometime after <a href="/wiki/100" id="w">100</a> AD),<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> who became known, in his capacity as a <a href="/wiki/Roman_citizenship" id="w">Roman citizen</a>, as <b>Titus Flavius Josephus</b>,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> was a <a href="/wiki/1st-century" id="w">1st-century</a> <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jewish</a> historian and apologist of priestly and royal ancestry who survived and recorded the <a href="/wiki/Destruction_of_Jerusalem" id="w">Destruction of Jerusalem</a> in <a href="/wiki/70" id="w">70</a>.

</p>
<p>Josephus, who introduced himself in <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> as &#34;Iosepos (Ιώσηπος), son of Matthias, an ethnic <a href="/wiki/Hebrews" id="w">Hebrew</a>, a priest from <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" id="w">Jerusalem</a>&#34;,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> fought the Romans in the <a href="/wiki/First_Jewish-Roman_War" id="w">First Jewish-Roman War</a> of <a href="/wiki/66" id="w">66</a>-<a href="/wiki/73" id="w">73</a> as a Jewish military leader in <a href="/wiki/Galilee" id="w">Galilee</a>. After the Jewish garrison of <a href="/wiki/Yodfat" id="w">Yodfat</a> was taken under siege, the Romans invaded, killing thousands, and the remaining survivors who had managed to elude the forces committed suicide. However, in circumstances that are somewhat unclear, Josephus and one of his soldiers surrendered to the Roman forces invading Galilee in July <a href="/wiki/67" id="w">67</a>. He became a prisoner and provided the Romans with intelligence on the ongoing revolt. The Roman forces were led by Flavius <a href="/wiki/Vespasian" id="w">Vespasian</a> and his son <a href="/wiki/Titus" id="w">Titus</a>, both subsequently <a href="/wiki/Roman_emperor" id="w">Roman emperors</a>. In <a href="/wiki/69" id="w">69</a>, Josephus was released (cf. <i>War</i> IV.622-629) and according to Josephus&#39;s own account, he appears to have played some role as a negotiator with the defenders in the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(70)" id="w">Siege of Jerusalem</a> in <a href="/wiki/70" id="w">70</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/71" id="w">71</a>, he arrived in Rome in the entourage of Titus, becoming a Roman citizen and <a href="/wiki/Flavian" id="w">Flavian dynasty</a> client (hence he is often referred to as Flavius Josephus - see below). In addition to Roman citizenship he was granted accommodation in conquered <a href="/wiki/Iudaea_Province" id="w">Judea</a>, and a decent, if not extravagant, pension. It was while in Rome, and under Flavian patronage, that Josephus wrote all of his known works.</p>
<p>Although he only ever calls himself &#34;Josephus&#34;, he appears to have taken the Roman <a href="/wiki/Nomen" id="w">nomen</a> Flavius and <a href="/wiki/Praenomen" id="w">praenomen</a> Titus from his patrons.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> This was standard for new citizens.</p>
<p>Josephus&#39;s first wife perished together with his parents in Jerusalem during the siege and <a href="/wiki/Vespasian" id="w">Vespasian</a> arranged for him to marry a Jewish woman who had been captured by the Romans. This woman left Josephus, and around <a href="/wiki/70" id="w">70</a>, he married a Jewish woman from <a href="/wiki/Alexandria%2C_Egypt" id="w">Alexandria</a> by whom he had three male children. Only one, Flavius Hyrcanus, survived childhood. Josephus later divorced his third wife and around <a href="/wiki/75" id="w">75</a>, married his fourth wife, a Jewish girl from Crete, from a distinguished family. This last marriage produced two sons, Flavius Justus and Simonides Agrippa.</p>
<p>Josephus&#39;s life is beset with ambiguity. For his critics, he never satisfactorily explained his actions during the Jewish war — why he failed to commit suicide in Galilee in 67 with some of his compatriots, and why, after his capture, he cooperated with the Roman invaders. Historian <a href="/wiki/E._Mary_Smallwood" id="w">E. Mary Smallwood</a> wrote:</p>
<p /><blockquote>(Josephus) was conceited, not only about his own learning but also about the opinions held of him as commander both by the Galileans and by the Romans; he was guilty of shocking duplicity at <a href="/wiki/Jotapata" id="w">Jotapata</a>, saving himself by sacrifice of his companions; he was too naive to see how he stood condemned out of his own mouth for his conduct, and yet no words were too harsh when he was blackening his opponents; and after landing, however involuntarily, in the Roman camp, he turned his captivity to his own advantage, and benefitted for the rest of his days from his change of side.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>However, his critics ignore the fact that <a href="/wiki/Simon_Bar_Giora" id="w">Simon Bar Giora</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_of_Giscala" id="w">John of Giscala</a>, both extreme zealots and great opponents of Josephus, who stayed in Jerusalem and led the war against Rome in its final stage, in a moment of truth, preferred life over suicide and humbly surrendered to the Romans. At any rate, those who have viewed Josephus as a traitor and informer have questioned his credibility as a historian — dismissing his works as Roman propaganda or as a personal <a href="/wiki/Apologetics" id="w">apologetic</a>, aimed at rehabilitating his reputation in history. More recently, commentators have reassessed previously-held views of Josephus. As <a href="/wiki/P.J._O%26%2339%3BRourke" id="w">P.J. O&#39;Rourke</a> quipped,
</p><blockquote>Reason dictates we should hate this man. But it&#39;s hard to get angry at Josephus. What, after all, did he do? A few soldiers were tricked into suicide. Some demoralizing claptrap was shouted at a beleaguered army. A wife was distressed... all of which pale by comparison to what the good men did. For it was the loyal, the idealistic and the brave who did the real damage. The devout and patriotic leaders of Jerusalem sacrificed tens of thousands of lives to the cause of freedom. Vespasian and Titus sacrificed tens of thousands of more to the cause of civil order. Even <a href="/wiki/Agrippa_II" id="w">Agrippa II</a>, the Roman client king of Judea who did all he could to prevent the war, ended by supervising the destruction of half a dozen of his cities and the sale of their inhabitants into slavery. How much better for everyone if all the principal figures of the region had been slithering filth like Josephus.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Josephus was unquestionably an important apologist in the Roman world for the Jewish people and culture, particularly at a time of conflict and tension. He always remained, in his own eyes, a loyal and law-observant Jew. He went out of his way both to commend Judaism to educated <a href="/wiki/Gentile" id="w">Gentiles</a>, and to insist on its compatibility with cultured <a href="/wiki/Graeco-Roman" id="w">Graeco-Roman</a> thought. He constantly contended for the antiquity of <a href="/wiki/Jewish_culture" id="w">Jewish culture</a>, presenting its people as civilised, devout and philosophical.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Eusebius" id="w">Eusebius</a> reports that a statue of Josephus was erected in Rome.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Significance_to_scholarship" name="Significance_to_scholarship"></a><h1>Significance to scholarship</h1>
<p>The works of Josephus provide crucial information about the First Jewish-Roman War and are also important literary source material for understanding the context of the <a href="/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls" id="w">Dead Sea Scrolls</a> and post-<a href="/wiki/Second_Temple" id="w">Second Temple</a> Judaism. Josephan scholarship in the <a href="/wiki/19th_century" id="w">19th</a> and early <a href="/wiki/20th_century" id="w">20th century</a> became focused on Josephus&#39; relationship to the sect of the <a href="/wiki/Pharisees" id="w">Pharisees</a>. He was consistently portrayed as a member of the sect, but nevertheless viewed as a villainous traitor to his own nation - a view which became known as the classical concept of Josephus. In the mid 20th century, this view was challenged by a new generation of scholars who formulated the modern concept of Josephus, still considering him a Pharisee but restoring his reputation in part as patriot and a historian of some standing. Recent scholarship since 1990 has sought to move scholarly perceptions forward by demonstrating that Josephus was not a Pharisee but an orthodox Aristocrat-Priest who became part of the Temple establishment as a matter of deference and not willing association (Cf. Steve Mason, Todd Beall, and Ernst Gerlach).</p>
<p>Josephus offers information about individuals, groups, customs and geographical places. His writings provide a significant, extra-biblical account of the post-exilic period of the <a href="/wiki/Maccabees" id="w">Maccabees</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Hasmonean" id="w">Hasmonean</a> dynasty and the rise of <a href="/wiki/Herod_the_Great" id="w">Herod the Great</a>. He makes references to the <a href="/wiki/Sadducee" id="w">Sadducees</a>, Jewish <a href="/wiki/Kohen_Gadol" id="w">High Priests</a> of the time, Pharisees and <a href="/wiki/Essenes" id="w">Essenes</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Herod%26%2339%3Bs_Temple" id="w">Herodian Temple</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quirinius" id="w">Quirinius</a>&#39; census and the <a href="/wiki/Zealots" id="w">Zealots</a>, and to such figures as <a href="/wiki/Pontius_Pilate" id="w">Pontius Pilate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Herod_the_Great" id="w">Herod the Great</a>, <a href="/wiki/Agrippa_I" id="w">Agrippa I</a> and <a href="/wiki/Agrippa_II" id="w">Agrippa II</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_the_Baptist" id="w">John the Baptist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus#Reference to Jesus as brother of James .28xx 9.1.29" id="w">James the brother of Jesus</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus#Testimonium Flavianum" id="w">disputed reference</a> to <a href="/wiki/Jesus" id="w">Jesus</a>. He is an important source for studies of immediate post-Temple Judaism (and, thus, the context of <a href="/wiki/Early_Christianity" id="w">early Christianity</a>).</p>
<p>A careful reading of Josephus&#39; writings allowed <a href="/wiki/Ehud_Netzer" id="w">Ehud Netzer</a>, an archaeologist from Hebrew University, to confirm the location of Herod&#39;s Tomb after a fruitless search of 35 years - on top of tunnels and water pools at a flattened desert site, halfway up the hill to the <a href="/wiki/Herodium" id="w">Herodium</a>, 12 kilometers south of Jerusalem - exactly where it should be according to Josephus writings.</p>
<p>For many years, the works of Josephus were printed only in an imperfect Latin translation from the original Greek. It was only in 1544 that a version of the Greek text was made available, edited by the Dutch humanist <a href="/wiki/Arnoldus_Arlenius" id="w">Arnoldus Arlenius</a>. The first English translation appeared in 1602 by Thomas Lodge with subsequent editions appearing throught the 17th century. However, the 1544 Greek translation formed the basis of the 1732 English translation by <a href="/wiki/William_Whiston" id="w">William Whiston</a> which achieved enormous popularity in the English speaking world and which is currently available online for free download by <a href="/wiki/Project_Gutenberg" id="w">Project Gutenberg</a>. Later editions of the Greek text include that of <a href="/wiki/Benedikt_Niese" id="w">Benedikt Niese</a>, who made a detailed examination of all the available manuscripts, mainly from France and Spain. This was the version used by H. St J. Thackeray for the <a href="/wiki/Loeb_Classical_Library" id="w">Loeb Classical Library</a> edition widely used today.

<a id="The_Jewish_War" name="The_Jewish_War"></a><h2>The Jewish War</h2>
<p>{{Wikisourcelang}}</p>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>His first work in Rome was an account of the Jewish War, addressed to certain &#34;upper barbarians&#34; – usually thought to be the Jewish community in <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia" id="w">Mesopotamia</a> – in his &#34;paternal tongue&#34; (<i>War</i> I.3), arguably the Western <a href="/wiki/Aramaic_language" id="w">Aramaic language</a>. He then wrote a seven-volume account in <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> known to us as the <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wars_of_the_Jews" id="w">Jewish War</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> <i>Bellum Iudaicum</i>). It starts with the period of the <a href="/wiki/Maccabees" id="w">Maccabees</a> and concludes with accounts of the fall of <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" id="w">Jerusalem</a>, the Roman victory celebrations in Rome, the mopping-up operations, Roman military operations elsewhere in the Empire and the uprising in <a href="/wiki/Cyrene%2C_Libya" id="w">Cyrene</a>. Together with the account in his <i>Life</i> of some of the same events, it also provides the reader with an overview of Josephus&#39; own part in the events since his return to Jerusalem from a brief visit to Rome in the early <a href="/wiki/60s" id="w">60s</a> (<i>Life</i> 13-17).</p>
<p>Rome cannot have been an easy place for a Jew in the wake of the suppression of the Jewish revolt. Josephus would have witnessed the marches of Titus&#39; triumphant legions leading their Jewish captives, and carrying trophies of despoiled treasure from the <a href="/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem" id="w">Temple in Jerusalem</a>. He would have experienced the popular presentation of the Jews as a bellicose and misanthropic people.</p>
<p>It was against this background that Josephus wrote his <i>War</i>, and although often dismissed as pro-Roman propaganda (perhaps hardly surprising given where his patronage was coming from), he claims to be writing to counter anti-Judean accounts. He disputes the claim that the Jews serve a defeated god and are naturally hostile to Roman civilization. Rather, he blames the Jewish War on what he calls &#34;unrepresentative and <a href="/wiki/Zealots" id="w">over-zealous fanatics</a>&#34; among the Jews, who led the masses away from their natural aristocratic leaders (like him), with disastrous results. He also blames some of the governors of Judea, but these he presents as atypical Romans: corrupt and incompetent administrators. Thus, according to Josephus, the traditional Jew was, should be, and can be, a loyal and peace-loving citizen. Jews can, and historically have, accepted Rome&#39;s hegemony precisely because of their faith that God himself gives empires their power.</p>
<a id="Jewish_Antiquities" name="Jewish_Antiquities"></a><h2>Jewish Antiquities</h2>
<p>{{main}}
The next literary work by Josephus is his twenty-one volume <i><a href="/wiki/Antiquities_of_the_Jews" id="w">Antiquities of the Jews</a></i>, completed in the last year of the emperor Flavius <a href="/wiki/Domitian" id="w">Domitian</a> (between 1.9.<a href="/wiki/93" id="w">93</a> and 14.3.94, cf. AJ X.267). He claims that interested persons have pressed him to give a fuller account of the Jewish culture and constitution. Here, in expounding Jewish history, law and custom, he is entering into many philosophical debates current in Rome at that time. Again he offers an <i>apologia</i> for the antiquity and universal significance of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>Beginning with the story of <a href="/wiki/Creation_(theology)" id="w">Creation</a>, he outlines Jewish history. <a href="/wiki/Abraham" id="w">Abraham</a> taught <a href="/wiki/Science" id="w">science</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">Egyptians</a>, who in turn taught the <a href="/wiki/Greeks" id="w">Greeks</a>. <a href="/wiki/Moses" id="w">Moses</a> set up a senatorial priestly aristocracy, which like that of Rome resisted monarchy. The great figures of the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">biblical stories</a> are presented as ideal philosopher-leaders. There is again an autobiographical appendix defending Josephus&#39; own conduct at the end of the war when he cooperated with the Roman forces.</p>
<a id="Against_Apion" name="Against_Apion"></a><h2>Against Apion</h2>
<p>Josephus&#39; <i><a href="/wiki/Against_Apion" id="w">Against Apion</a></i> is a final two-volume defence of Judaism as <a href="/wiki/Classical_antiquity" id="w">classical</a> <a href="/wiki/Religion" id="w">religion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" id="w">philosophy</a>, stressing its antiquity against what Josephus claimed was the relatively more recent traditions of the Greeks. Some anti-Judean allegations ascribed by Josephus to the Greek writer <a href="/wiki/Apion" id="w">Apion</a>, and myths accredited to <a href="/wiki/Manetho" id="w">Manetho</a> are also exposed.</p>
