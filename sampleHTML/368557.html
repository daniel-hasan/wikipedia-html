<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1> History </h1>

<p>The city of Lismore resides in the Aboriginal Bundjalung Nation area. Evidence indicates the Bundjalung people arrived from the north of Australia around <a href="/wiki/6th_millennium_BC" id="w">8,000 years ago</a>.
European History of Lismore begins in c.1843. A pastoral run covering an area of 93 <a href="/wiki/Square_kilometre" id="w">km²</a> was taken up by Captain Dumaresq at this time covering the Lismore area. The run was stocked with sheep from the
<a href="/wiki/New_England" id="w">New England</a> area. Ward Stephens took up the run in the same year, but the sub-tropical climate was unsuited to sheep grazing, so the run was eventually abandoned.
In January <a href="/wiki/1845" id="w">1845</a>, William and Jane Wilson took over the run. Jane Wilson was responsible for naming it after <a href="/wiki/Lismore%2C_Scotland" id="w">Lismore, Scotland</a>, where the couple honeymooned. The Wilsons were Scottish themselves, and arrived in NSW in May <a href="/wiki/1883" id="w">1883</a>.
In <a href="/wiki/1855" id="w">1855</a>, a surveyor by the name of Frederick Peppercorne was instructed by Sir <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Mitchell" id="w">Thomas Mitchell</a> to determine a site for a township in the area. The chosen site was William Wilson&#39;s homestead paddock, and the area was proclaimed the &#34;Town of Lismore&#34; in the NSW Government Gazette on <a href="/wiki/1_May" id="w">1 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1856" id="w">1856</a>.</p>
<a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h1> Climate </h1>
<p>Lismore experiences mild to warm temperatures all year round, with an ample rainfall. Temperatures in the summer range from anywhere between {{convert}} and {{convert}}. The sub-tropical climate combined with geographical features means the urban area is unusually humid when compared with surrounding areas, especially in the summer season. Although no major environmental hazards affect the area, Lismore is renowned for the occasional <a href="/wiki/Flood" id="w">flood</a>, one of the worst having occurred in 1974, rising to a water height of {{convert}}. Following a flood in 2001, the then <a href="/wiki/Premier_of_New_South_Wales" id="w">Premier of New South Wales</a> — <a href="/wiki/Bob_Carr" id="w">Bob Carr</a> — initiated a flood levee program to curb the problem. Nonetheless, 6,000 residents of Lismore were evacuated after floods affected much of the area on <a href="/wiki/June_30" id="w">June 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, many being temporarily housed on the campus of Southern Cross University. However, a new levee that had been completed two weeks prior limited damage and stopped the water reaching the central business area. on <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> a weak tornado struck nearby <a href="/wiki/Dunoon%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Dunoon</a>, captured on video as it struck a direct hit on an electrical transformer station.</p>
