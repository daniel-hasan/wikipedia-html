<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>In April 1887, J. T. Berry established a site for a town after he chose a well-watered section along the way of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, which had begun building across the <a href="/wiki/Texas_Panhandle" id="w">Texas Panhandle</a>. Berry and <a href="/wiki/Colorado_City%2C_Texas" id="w">Colorado City, Texas</a> merchants wanted to make their new town site the region&#39;s main trading center. On <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1887" id="w">1887</a>, Berry&#39;s town site won the <a href="/wiki/County_seat" id="w">county seat</a> election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the <a href="/wiki/Railroad" id="w">railroad</a> and <a href="/wiki/Freight" id="w">freight</a> service after the county seat election made the town a fast growing <a href="/wiki/Cattle" id="w">cattle</a> marketing center.<sup id="_ref-handbook_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-handbook" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The settlement originally was called Oneida; it would later change its name to Amarillo. Amarillo&#39;s name probably derives from yellow wildflowers that were plentiful during the spring and summer or the nearby Amarillo Lake and Amarillo Creek, named in turn for the yellow soil along their banks and shores (<i>Amarillo</i> is the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" id="w">Spanish</a> word for the color <i>yellow</i>). Despite having a name of Spanish origin, the City of Amarillo is pronounced in <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> as &#34;Am-ah-RILL-oh&#34; rather than &#34;Ah-mah-REE-yoh&#34;. Early residents pronounced it according to the Spanish pronunciation, but within a year, the English pronunciation prevailed. Charles F. Rudolph, editor of the <i>Tascosa Pioneer</i>, predicted the pronunciation change after blaming Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad employees for ignoring the word&#39;s Spanish pronunciation.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_19" id="w">June 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1888" id="w">1888</a>, Henry B. Sanborn, who is given credit as the &#34;Father of Amarillo,&#34;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> and his business partner <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Glidden" id="w">Joseph F. Glidden</a> began buying land to the east to move Amarillo after arguing that Berry&#39;s site was on low ground and would flood during rainstorms. Sanborn also offered to trade lots in the new location to businesses in the original city’s site and help with the expense of moving to new buildings. His incentives gradually won over people, who moved their businesses to Polk Street in the new commercial district.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Heavy rains almost flooded Berry’s part of the town in 1889, prompting more people to move to Sanborn&#39;s location. This eventually led to another county seat election making Sanborn&#39;s town the new county seat in 1893.<sup id="_ref-handbook_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-handbook" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the late 1890s, Amarillo had emerged as one of the world&#39;s busiest cattle shipping points, and its population grew significantly. The city became an elevator, milling, and feed-manufacturing center after an increase in production of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s. Discovery of <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" id="w">gas</a> in 1918 and <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" id="w">oil</a> three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area.<sup id="_ref-handbook_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-handbook" title="">[3]</a></sup> The United States government bought the Cliffside Gas Field with high helium content in 1927 and the Federal Bureau of Mines began operating the Amarillo Helium Plant two years later.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The plant would be the sole producer of commercial helium in the world for a number of years.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/National_Helium_Reserve" id="w">U.S. National Helium Reserve</a> is stored in the Bush Dome Reservoir at the Cliffside facility.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following the lead of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, the <a href="/wiki/Atchison%2C_Topeka_and_Santa_Fe_Railway" id="w">Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_Rock_Island_and_Pacific_Railroad" id="w">Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad</a> established services to and from Amarillo.

<p>During the 1930s, the city was hit by the <a href="/wiki/Dust_Bowl" id="w">Dust Bowl</a> and entered an <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">economic depression</a>. The <a href="/wiki/U.S._Routes" id="w">U.S. Routes</a> 60, 87, 287, and 66 merged at Amarillo, making it a major tourist stop with numerous motels, restaurants, and <a href="/wiki/Curio" id="w">curio</a> shops. <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> led the establishment of Amarillo Army Air Field in east Amarillo and the nearby Pantex Army Ordnance Plant, which produced bombs and ammunition. After the end of the war, both of the facilities were closed. The Pantex Plant was reopened in 1950 and produced nuclear weapons throughout the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" id="w">Cold War</a>.<sup id="_ref-handbook_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-handbook" title="">[3]</a></sup> The following year, the army air base was reactivated as <a href="/wiki/Amarillo_Air_Force_Base" id="w">Amarillo Air Force Base</a> and expanded to accommodate a <a href="/wiki/Strategic_Air_Command" id="w">Strategic Air Command</a> <a href="/wiki/B-52_Stratofortress" id="w">B-52 Stratofortress</a> wing.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The arrival of servicemen and their families ended the city&#39;s depression. Between 1950 and 1960, Amarillo&#39;s population grew from 74,443 to 137,969. However, the closure of the Amarillo Air Force Base on <a href="/wiki/December_31" id="w">December 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/1968" id="w">1968</a>, contributed to a decrease in population to 127,010 by 1970.

Amarillo is located near the middle of the Texas Panhandle and is part of the Llano Estacado or Staked Plains region which has a surface that is relatively flat and has little drainage in the soil.

Local transit services in the city have been available since 1925 and have been provided through the City of Amarillo&#39;s Amarillo City Transit (ACT) department since 1966; prior to that time the system was privately owned. ACT operates bus services that include fixed route transit and demand response <a href="/wiki/Paratransit" id="w">paratransit</a> which are designed for people with disabilities. The ACT transports approximately 350,000 passengers per year on the fixed route and 30,000 paratransit passengers, but it is a declining ridership. ACT has no plans to scale back any of their transit routes or services.<sup id="_ref-community_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-community" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Amarillo has no passenger rail service but remains an important part of the rail freight system. The <a href="/wiki/BNSF_Railway" id="w">BNSF Railway</a> complex in Amarillo continues to serve a heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100-110 trains per day.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Union_Pacific_Railroad" id="w">Union Pacific Railroad</a> also sends substantial shipments to or through Amarillo. In addition to intermodal and general goods, a big portion of rail shipments involve grains and coal.</p>
<p>The streets in Amarillo&#39;s downtown area conform to a <a href="/wiki/Grid_pattern" id="w">grid pattern</a>. The city&#39;s original street layout was set up by William H. Bush, beginning at the west end of the town moving to the east. Bush named the north to south streets for past <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">United States presidents</a>, in chronological order except for <a href="/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams" id="w">John Quincy Adams</a> because the surname was taken with the second president, <a href="/wiki/John_Adams" id="w">John Adams</a>.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> (The last president so honored was <a href="/wiki/Grover_Cleveland" id="w">Grover Cleveland</a>; though the city has expanded eastward the pattern was not continued.)  While the streets running north-south honor past presidents and are designated &#39;streets&#39;, east-west streets are numbered and are designated &#39;avenues&#39;.  North of the Fort Worth &#38; Denver (now Burlington Northern-Santa Fe) railyard, the numbers are &#34;NW&#34; (northwest) west of Polk Street, and &#34;NE&#34; (northeast) east of Polk.  South of the railyard (including the downtown-city center area), numbers are officially &#34;SW&#34; (southwest) west of Polk, and &#34;SE&#34; (southeast) east of Polk.  Colloquially, though, most tend to dub the SW/SE avenues as W (west)/E (east), respectively.  One example of the numbering difference regards the former U.S. Route 66 routing west of downtown and into the San Jacinto neighborhood.  Most call it &#39;West Sixth Street&#39; when it&#39;s actually SW Sixth Avenue.</p>
<p>In 1910, the Amarillo voters approved to pay for street paving and the materials used to pave the streets were <a href="/wiki/Brick" id="w">bricks</a>.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> As of 2003, the city still has 16.2&#160;mi (26.1&#160;km) of brick streets in some parts of the downtown area.

<p>Less than one mile (2 km) of <a href="/wiki/Interstate_27" id="w">Interstate 27</a> highway is located in Potter County.

<p>Interstate 40, the city&#39;s major east-west thoroughfare was completed entirely through Amarillo in November of 1968 across the center of the city. Previously, <a href="/wiki/U.S._Route_66" id="w">U.S. Route 66</a> was the major east-west highway through the city, generally following Amarillo Blvd. to the north of the downtown area and then curving southwest to leave the city near the Veterans Hospital. A city route (which was an original alignment of U.S. 66 through central and west Amarillo) followed Fillmore south into the downtown area and turned on West 6th through the San Jacinto Heights district which is now home to many antique shops, restaurants and other businesses, passing the Amarillo Country Club and veering onto West 9th Street and Bushland Blvd. before tying into the through route at a traffic circle near the Veterans Hospital.
Loop 335 circles around Amarillo in all four directions and consists of four-lane roadway on its northeast and southwest quadrants and two-lane paving to the southeast and northwest.</p>
