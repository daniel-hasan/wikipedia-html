<p>&#34;<b>Heartbreak Hotel</b>&#34; is a <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" id="w">rock and roll</a> song performed by <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" id="w">Elvis Presley</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Bill_Black" id="w">Bill Black</a> (<a href="/wiki/Bass_guitar" id="w">bass</a>), <a href="/wiki/Scotty_Moore" id="w">Scotty Moore</a> (<a href="/wiki/Guitar" id="w">guitar</a>), <a href="/wiki/D.J._Fontana" id="w">D.J. Fontana</a> (<a href="/wiki/Drums" id="w">drums</a>), <a href="/wiki/Floyd_Cramer" id="w">Floyd Cramer</a> (<a href="/wiki/Piano" id="w">piano</a>) and Elvis on rhythm guitar as the main supporting musicians.   Recorded in January 1956 in Nashville, the song introduced Presley to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> national <a href="/wiki/Music" id="w">music</a> consciousness.  It was released as a <a href="/wiki/Single_(music)" id="w">single</a> with the b-side song &#34;I Was The One&#34; on <a href="/wiki/January_27" id="w">January 27</a> <a href="/wiki/1956" id="w">1956</a>. &#34;Heartbreak Hotel&#34; became the first No.1 pop record by Elvis and was the best selling single of 1956.<sup id="_ref-first_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-first" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Song's_history" name="Song's_history"></a><h1>Song&#39;s history</h1>
<p>The song is an example of <a href="/wiki/Simple_verse_form" id="w">simple verse form</a> based on the <a href="/wiki/Eight-bar_blues" id="w">eight-bar blues</a> progression. It was written by Thomas Durden, then a steel-guitarist in Smiling Jack Herring and his Swing Billies, <a class="externallink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,258803,00.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,258803,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,258803,00.html</a> and Mae Boren Axton, a teacher at Dupont Jr.-Sr. High School in <a href="/wiki/Jacksonville%2C_Florida" id="w">Jacksonville</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, and the mother of singer/songwriter/actor <a href="/wiki/Hoyt_Axton" id="w">Hoyt Axton</a>. Her connection to Elvis Presley was that she was a publicist for <a href="/wiki/Hank_Snow" id="w">Hank Snow</a>, who was managed by Colonel Tom Parker, who also managed Elvis Presley. Elvis Presley received co-songwriting credit for his contributions to the final recorded release.<a class="externallink" href="http://rcs.law.emory.edu/rcs/pics/d03/3328.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://rcs.law.emory.edu/rcs/pics/d03/3328.htm">http://rcs.law.emory.edu/rcs/pics/d03/3328.htm</a> In an interview, Tommy Durden conceded that he did not recognize the song after Elvis had made the changes to the song in the studio, including changes to the tempo, phrasing, lyrics, and overall sound. </p>
<p>Durden read about a suicide in the Miami Herald in 1955. A well-dressed man had removed all labels from his clothing, destroyed his identity papers and left a note saying: &#34;I walk a lonely street.&#34; <a class="externallink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,258803,00.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,258803,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,258803,00.html</a></p>
<p>This was the first song recorded by Elvis at RCA Victor.  Elvis selected the song. He had earlier promised Mae Boren Axton that he would want to record it. He arrived at the studio with the song ready to record it without input from RCA. Although producer <a href="/wiki/Steve_Sholes" id="w">Steve Sholes</a> was worried, he recorded the song taking it on faith that Elvis knew what he was doing. Most others at RCA Victor believed that it was a mistake, especially after hearing that the finished recording sounded nothing like the prior Elvis recordings at Sun Records.</p>
<p>RCA producers placed  microphones at the end of a hallway to achieve the echo effect that <a href="/wiki/Sam_Phillips" id="w">Sam Phillips</a> had achieved at <a href="/wiki/Sun_Studios" id="w">Sun Studios</a> for Presley&#39;s 1954-1955 recorings for Phillips&#39; Sun Studios. Phillps had used two tape recorders and a slight time delay, unbeknowst to the RCA personnel.<sup id="_ref-Elvis56_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Elvis56" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Song's_status_on_the_charts" name="Song's_status_on_the_charts"></a><h1>Song&#39;s status on the charts</h1>
<p>&#34;Heartbreak Hotel&#34; was no. 1 for 8 weeks on the Billboard Pop Singles Chart when released in 1956 on RCA Records. The record was no. 1 for 17 weeks on the Billboard Country Chart and reached no. 3 on the Billboard Rhythm &#38; Blues Chart. In 2006, more than 50 years after its initial release, &#34;Heartbreak Hotel&#34; returned to no. 1 on the Billboard Hot Singles Sales Chart when re-released.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Steve_Sholes" id="w">Steve Sholes</a> used a hallway at the studio to get a noticeably unusual echo for the single.  Sholes was attempting to recapture the Sun Records sound not knowing that <a href="/wiki/Sam_Phillips" id="w">Sam Phillips</a> ran recordings through a second recorder head to produce the Sun Records echo. Because the vocals on the original record featured such a heavy use of <a href="/wiki/Reverb" id="w">reverb</a>, the song was immediately lampooned in radio humorist <a href="/wiki/Stan_Freberg" id="w">Stan Freberg</a>&#39;s parody of the song, where the lead singer repeatedly asks for &#34;more echo on [his] voice.&#34;  When Elvis recorded <a href="/wiki/Hound_Dog_(song)" id="w">Hound Dog</a> a few months later, he had completely taken over the role of producer, using what he learned at Sun Records (although Steve Sholes was still credited) and decided not to use echo.</p>
<p>&#34;Heartbreak Hotel&#34;&#39;s lyrical matter deals with the singer&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Sadness" id="w">sadness</a>, implicitly that following the end of a <a href="/wiki/Romantic_love" id="w">romantic</a> relationship. It uses the <a href="/wiki/Metaphor" id="w">metaphor</a> of a <a href="/wiki/Hotel" id="w">hotel</a> to represent this emotional state. </p>
<p>The song was later ranked #45 on <a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" id="w">Rolling Stone</a>&#39;s list of the <a href="/wiki/500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time" id="w">500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a> and is a Grammy Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>In 1956, Presley sang the song live and introduced it at the Tommy Dorsey TV Show, on <a href="/wiki/February_11" id="w">February 11</a>.  He also sang it on <a href="/wiki/March_1" id="w">March 1</a> and <a href="/wiki/March_24" id="w">March 24</a> of that year, and on his third and last appearance at the Ed Sullivan Show, also on CBS, on <a href="/wiki/January_6" id="w">January 6</a> <a href="/wiki/1957" id="w">1957</a>. Cumulative viewers for these first television performances are estimated at over 60 million. In 1968, he also sang it on his celebrated &#34;Comeback TV Special&#34;, in a medley with <a href="/wiki/Hound_Dog_(song)" id="w">Hound Dog</a> and <a href="/wiki/All_Shook_Up" id="w">All Shook Up</a>.  </p>

<p>{{Trivia}}
During the late-1950s and early 1960s, <a href="/wiki/Johnny_Cash" id="w">Johnny Cash</a> and his band (The Tennessee Three) performed a parody of Elvis&#39; stage techniques as a comedy act during concerts. Johnny would have Marshall Grant (his bass player) hand him a comb, so he could re-style his hair in an exaggerated approximation of Elvis&#39; hairstyle. He would then proceed to sing &#34;Heartbreak Hotel&#34; whilst shaking his hips and legs in the manner of Elvis. After his &#39;song&#39;, Johnny would take the comb back and put his hair back to normal, while saying &#34;I walked past a barber shop earlier today, and the barber came out and said &#39;hey son, I&#39;ll give you an estimate&#39;&#34;. He&#39;d drop the comb (implying it had come alive from all the wax and such that was in his hair) and Marshall would shoot it with a blank pistol; Johnny and <a href="/wiki/Luther_Perkins" id="w">Luther Perkins</a> (his lead guitarist) would jump off the stage in fright, and his drummer (<a href="/wiki/W.S._Holland" id="w">W.S. Holland</a>) would fall off his stool.</p>
<p>There are numerous cover versions of the song, including one by avant garde musician <a href="/wiki/John_Cale" id="w">John Cale</a>, although the mood of the song was significantly more unsettling than Elvis&#39;s version.  <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Emmanuel" id="w">Tommy Emmanuel</a> has recently included this song into his repertoire and only involves him on lead guitar and vocals. </p>
