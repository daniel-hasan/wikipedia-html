<i>Tenacious D</i> premiered in 1997, immediately following an episode of <i>Mr. Show</i>.

Tenacious D started their second nationwide <a href="/wiki/Concert" id="w">concert tour</a> in 2001, playing at bigger venues, many of which sold out.<sup id="_ref-AMG_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AMG" title="">[2]</a></sup> Until 2006, Tenacious D usually performed only with acoustic guitars and rarely performed with a full band. Tenacious D has staged two international concert tours, and numerous domestic tours,<sup id="_ref-tenacious-d-tours_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tenacious-d-tours" title="">[44]</a></sup> though they have rarely played in non-English speaking countries. Black says this is because foreign concerts are &#34;a little funky&#34; because &#34;the subtleties do get lost in translation&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Relix_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Relix" title="">[45]</a></sup> In addition, he comments of the angst they experience before concerts saying: &#34;We&#39;re always looking for a loophole. Pretty much every concert we&#39;ve ever done, we&#39;re trying to find a way to cancel the show at the last minute.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Relix_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Relix" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
