The <b>Somerset Railroad</b> {{reporting mark}} is a shortline railroad that operates in <a href="/wiki/Niagara_County%2C_New_York" id="w">Niagara County, New York</a>. The railroad was built with the primary objective of providing <a href="/wiki/Coal" id="w">coal</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Kintigh_Generating_Station" id="w">Kintigh Generating Station</a>, a 675 megawatt coal-fired <a href="/wiki/Power_plant" id="w">power plant</a> located in <a href="/wiki/Somerset%2C_New_York" id="w">Somerset, New York</a>. The Railroad in reality was built in 1983. From <a href="/wiki/Lockport_(city)%2C_New_York" id="w">Lockport, New York</a> it runs on the defunct <a href="/wiki/International_Railway_Co." id="w">International Railway Co.</a> (IRC) <a href="/wiki/Interurban" id="w">interurban</a> (intercity trolley) line opened in 1900 under the name <a href="/wiki/Buffalo%2C_Lockport_%26amp%3B_Olcott_Beach" id="w">Buffalo, Lockport &#38; Olcott Beach</a> (BL&#38;OB) which became part of the IRC in 1902. From <a href="/wiki/Newfane%2C_New_York" id="w">Newfane, New York</a> the SOM sweeps of the IRC (abandoned in 1937) to the <a href="/wiki/Rome%2C_Watertown_and_Ogdensburg_Railroad" id="w">Hojack Line</a> in <a href="/wiki/Appleton%2C_New_York" id="w">Appleton, New York</a> (Township of Newfane, Niagara County, NY) to West Somerset in the Town of Somerset. It then swings off to a series of spurs and a loop at the Kintigh Generating Station.</p>
<p>Although the Somerset Railroad owns 428 rotary-dump <a href="/wiki/Gondola_(rail)" id="w">gondola</a> cars, <a href="/wiki/CSX_Transportation" id="w">CSX</a> provides their motive power and operates the railroad. Prior to the acquisition of <a href="/wiki/Conrail" id="w">Conrail</a> by <a href="/wiki/Norfolk_Southern" id="w">Norfolk Southern</a> and CSX in <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a>, Conrail provided motive power. The Somerset Railroad right of way includes 15.59 <a href="/wiki/Mile" id="w">miles</a> (25 <a href="/wiki/Kilometre" id="w">km</a>) of trackage, known as the <a href="/wiki/Somerset_Secondary" id="w">Somerset Secondary</a>. <a href="/wiki/Unit_train" id="w">Unit</a> <a href="/wiki/Coal" id="w">coal</a> trains leaving from <a href="/wiki/Youngstown%2C_Ohio" id="w">Youngstown, Ohio</a>, run to <a href="/wiki/Erie%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Erie, Pennsylvania</a>, followed by <a href="/wiki/Buffalo%2C_New_York" id="w">Buffalo</a>, then north to the Niagara Branch, where they swing off onto the Lockport Branch, and finally in Lockport onto the Somerset Secondary. </p>
<p>The coal cars are unloaded using a rotary dumper at the power plant. Also on the line in Lockport is a chemical plant which receives anhydrous <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" id="w">ammonia</a> via the railroad. The first train on the line ran in November 1983, power was provided by four Conrail GE <a href="/wiki/B23-7" id="w">B23-7</a>&#39;s. The lead unit&#39;s number was #1926.</p>
<p>The Somerset Railroad Subdivision (called the <i>Somerset Secondary</i> under <a href="/wiki/Conrail" id="w">Conrail</a>) is a 15.59 mile section of <a href="/wiki/Railroad" id="w">railroad</a> between <a href="/wiki/Lockport_(city)%2C_New_York" id="w">Lockport, New York</a> and <a href="/wiki/Somerset%2C_New_York" id="w">Somerset, New York</a> built by the Somerset Railroad Corporation. The line was constructed to allow <a href="/wiki/Coal" id="w">coal</a> <a href="/wiki/Train" id="w">trains</a> to service the <a href="/wiki/Kintigh_Generating_Station" id="w">Kintigh Generating Station</a> in Somerset. East of <a href="/wiki/Newfane_(town)%2C_Niagara_County%2C_New_York" id="w">Newfane, NY</a>, the Somerset Secondary utilizes the abandoned <a href="/wiki/Rome%2C_Watertown_and_Ogdensburg_Railroad" id="w">Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad</a> right of way. The railroad track includes a large loop at the power plant where the coal cars are unloaded by a rotary dumper. A chemical plant in Lockport is also serviced from the line.</p>
