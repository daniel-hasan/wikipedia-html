The <b>Kitchen Building</b> was constructed in 1916 as an office building on the corner of 15th Street and Winchester Avenue. <sup id="_ref-PRESERVE_1978_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PRESERVE_1978" title="">[1]</a></sup> The <i>Second National Bank</i>, then known as the <i>Ashland Day and Night Bank</i> which was later renamed in 1922, occupied the first floor beginning in 1915 with other offices occupying the other levels.</p>
<p>In 1923, the <b>Ashland Bank Building</b> was constructed at the corner of Winchester Avenue and 16th Street. <sup id="_ref-HIS_ASHLAND_1954_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HIS_ASHLAND_1954" title="">[2]</a></sup> The 11-story, 116 ft.

<p>Constructed in 1926, the <b>Camayo Arcade</b> was considered the &#34;finest in the south&#34; by the <i>Paintsville Hearald</i>. <sup id="_ref-PRESERVE_1978_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PRESERVE_1978" title="">[1]</a></sup> It is a four-story structure between Winchester Avenue and the alley, and two-stories between the alley and Carter Avenue.

It was financed partially by $3 million in bonds issued by the city. <sup id="_ref-DI_062607_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DI_062607" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Construction on the $10 million Phase II project will begin in fall 2007 and be complete by October 2008. <sup id="_ref-DI_062607_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DI_062607" title="">[7]</a></sup> It is being financed partially by the city of Ashland through a $1.5 million bond issue.

A 16,000 sq. ft. shopping plaza will be constructed next to the <i>Chick-Fil-A</i>, which will contain at least one restaurant and four businesses.</p>
<p>Adjacent to Melody Mountain across US 23 is the 55-acre Providence Hill development project. It was first announced on December 21, 2004 <sup id="_ref-DI_122204_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DI_122204" title="">[8]</a></sup> after the land was purchased several days prior for $700,000.

On November 11, 2004, Ashland&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Main_Street" id="w">Main Street</a> program revealed plans for a streetscape project in the central business district. <sup id="_ref-DI_111204_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DI_111204" title="">[11]</a></sup> Billed as an economic development that would spur further revitalization of the downtown, the Kentucky&#39;s Main Street&#39;s initiative is to utilize state funds to restore business districts. The main focus in the plan is on Winchester Avenue which includes,
</p>
<ul>
<li>Narrowing Winchester Avenue between 13th Street and 18th Street to two-lanes,</li>
<li>Constructing new sidewalks and removing basements under city right-of-way,</li>
<li>Burying utilities,</li>
<li>Installing new traffic-signal mast-arms,</li>
<li>Installing new period street lights,</li>
<li>Retrofitting existing street lights with period street lamps,</li>
<li>Planting new trees and vegetation in &#34;pocket parks.&#34;</li></ul>
<p>Tinted concrete was to be used at crosswalks, but this was changed to brick due to concerns about future maintenance concerns. <sup id="_ref-DI_050305_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DI_050305" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The city received $850,000 in state grants in 2004 to jump start construction on a segment from 13th to 14th Streets along Winchester Avenue. <sup id="_ref-DI_111204_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DI_111204" title="">[11]</a></sup> In 2005, construction extended to 15th Street. An additional $3 million from state and federal grants is required for completion to 18th Street; completion is scheduled for 2008.</p>
<p>Along with the streetscape project, a Judd Plaza renovation is also being planned. <sup id="_ref-DI_102504_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DI_102504" title="">[13]</a></sup> More green space, recreational and seating areas, and a stage are envisioned for the brick-lined plaza at the corner of 16th Street and Winchester Avenue. It would be home to concerts, speeches and plays and would tie into the <a href="/wiki/Country_Music_Highway" id="w">Country Music Highway</a> which runs through the city. In the immediate future, a clock at the plaza may be installed that would honor the city&#39;s recent sesquicentennial celebration.</p>
