<p>{{History of Switzerland}}
The <b>growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy</b> began as an alliance between the communities of the valleys in the central <a href="/wiki/Alps" id="w">Alps</a> to facilitate the management of common interests such as <a href="/wiki/Free_trade" id="w">free trade</a> and to ensure the peace along the important trade routes through the mountains. In the late <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a>, this region belonged to the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" id="w">Holy Roman Empire</a>, and because of its strategic importance the <a href="/wiki/Hohenstaufen" id="w">Hohenstaufen</a> emperors had granted it <i><a href="/wiki/Reichsfrei" id="w">reichsfrei</a></i> status in the early thirteenth century. As <i>reichsfrei</i> regions, the <a href="/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland" id="w">cantons</a> (or regions) of <a href="/wiki/Canton_of_Uri" id="w">Uri</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canton_of_Schwyz" id="w">Schwyz</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Unterwalden" id="w">Unterwalden</a> were under the direct authority of the emperor without any intermediate <a href="/wiki/Liege_lord" id="w">liege lords</a> and thus were largely autonomous. </p>
<p>With the rise of the <a href="/wiki/Habsburg" id="w">Habsburg</a> dynasty, the kings and dukes of Habsburg sought to extend their influence over this region and to bring it under their rule; as a consequence, a conflict ensued between the Habsburgs and these mountain communities who tried to defend their privileged status as <i>reichsfrei</i> regions. The three founding cantons of the <i>Swiss <a href="/wiki/Eidgenossenschaft" id="w">Eidgenossenschaft</a></i>, as the <a href="/wiki/Confederation" id="w">confederacy</a> was called, were joined in the early fourteenth century by the city states of <a href="/wiki/Lucerne" id="w">Lucerne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich" id="w">Zürich</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Berne" id="w">Berne</a>, and they managed to defeat Habsburg armies on several occasions. They also profited from the fact that the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">emperors</a> of the Holy Roman Empire, for most of the fourteenth century, came from the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Luxembourg" id="w">House of Luxembourg</a> and regarded them as potential useful allies against the rival Habsburgs. By 1460, the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the <a href="/wiki/Rhine" id="w">Rhine</a> to the Alps and the <a href="/wiki/Jura_mountains" id="w">Jura mountains</a>. At the end of the fifteenth century, two wars resulted in an expansion to thirteen cantons (<i>Dreizehn Orte</i>): in the <a href="/wiki/Burgundy_Wars" id="w">Burgundy Wars</a> of the 1470s, the confederates asserted their hegemony on the western border, and their victory in the <a href="/wiki/Swabian_War" id="w">Swabian War</a> in 1499 against the forces of the Habsburg emperor <a href="/wiki/Maximilian_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Maximilian I</a> ensured a <i>de facto</i> independence from the empire. During their involvement in the <a href="/wiki/Italian_Wars" id="w">Italian Wars</a>, the Swiss brought the <a href="/wiki/Ticino" id="w">Ticino</a> under their control.</p>
<p>Two similar federations sprung up in neighboring areas in the Alps in the fourteenth century: in the <a href="/wiki/Grisons" id="w">Grisons</a>, the federation of the <a href="/wiki/Three_Leagues" id="w">Three Leagues</a> (<i>Drei Bünde</i>) was founded, and in the <a href="/wiki/Valais" id="w">Valais</a>, the Seven Tenths (<i>Sieben Zenden</i>) were formed as a result of the conflicts with the <a href="/wiki/Dukes_of_Savoy" id="w">Dukes of Savoy</a>. Neither federation was part of the medieval <i><a href="/wiki/Eidgenossenschaft" id="w">Eidgenossenschaft</a></i> but both maintained very close connections with it.

Under the <a href="/wiki/Hohenstaufen" id="w">Hohenstaufen</a> dynasty of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" id="w">Holy Roman Empire</a>, the three regions of <a href="/wiki/Uri" id="w">Uri</a>, <a href="/wiki/Schwyz" id="w">Schwyz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Unterwalden" id="w">Unterwalden</a> (the <i>Waldstätten</i> or &#34;forest communities&#34;) had gained the <i><a href="/wiki/Reichsfreiheit" id="w">Reichsfreiheit</a></i>, the first two because the emperors wanted to place the strategically important pass of the St. Gotthard under their direct control, the latter because most of its territory belonged to <i>reichsfrei</i> monasteries. The cities of <a href="/wiki/Berne" id="w">Berne</a> and <a href="/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich" id="w">Zürich</a> had also become <i>reichsfrei</i> when the dynasty of their patrons, the <a href="/wiki/Z%C3%A4hringer" id="w">Zähringer</a>, had died out. </p>
<p>When <a href="/wiki/Rudolph_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Rudolph I of Habsburg</a> was elected &#34;King of the Germans&#34; in 1273, he also became the direct <a href="/wiki/Liege_lord" id="w">liege lord</a> of these <i>reichsfrei</i> regions. He instituted a strict rule and raised the taxes to finance wars and further territorial acquisitions. When he died in 1291, his son <a href="/wiki/Albert_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Albert I</a> got involved in a power struggle with <a href="/wiki/Adolf_of_Nassau-Weilburg" id="w">Adolf of Nassau</a> for the German throne, and the Habsburg rule over the alpine territories weakened temporarily. Anti-Habsburg insurgences sprung up in <a href="/wiki/Swabia" id="w">Swabia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austria</a>, but were quashed quickly by Albert in 1292. <a href="/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich" id="w">Zürich</a> had participated in this uprising. Albert <a href="/wiki/Siege" id="w">besieged</a> the city, which had to accept him as its patron.</p> 
<p>This time of turmoil prompted the <i>Waldstätten</i> to cooperate more closely, trying to preserve or regain their <i>Reichsfreiheit</i>. Uri and Schwyz got their status reconfirmed by <a href="/wiki/Adolf_of_Nassau-Weilburg" id="w">Adolf of Nassau</a> in 1297, but to no avail, for Albert finally won the power struggle and became emperor in 1298 after Adolf was killed in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_G%C3%B6llheim" id="w">battle of Göllheim</a>.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The <a href="/wiki/Federal_Charter_of_1291" id="w">Federal Charter of 1291</a></div></div>

The <a href="/wiki/Federal_Charter_of_1291" id="w">Federal Charter of 1291</a> is regarded the oldest surviving written document of an alliance between Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden, the founding cantons of the <a href="/wiki/Old_Swiss_Confederacy" id="w">Old Swiss Confederacy</a>. Its authenticity is disputed, and it is generally considered to have been written a few decades later. It is likely that a similar arrangement between the three &#34;forest communities&#34; existed well before, maybe even since the time of the <a href="/wiki/Interregnum" id="w">interregnum</a>. After the death of emperor <a href="/wiki/Albert_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Albert I</a> in 1308, the German emperors came from the House of Luxembourg (with the exception of Louis IV from Bavaria) until 1438, and they reconfirmed the <i>Freibriefe</i> of the three communities and generally honored their status as <i>reichsfrei</i> regions. Even Unterwalden was finally properly granted this status by Albert&#39;s successor <a href="/wiki/Henry_VII%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Henry VII</a> in 1309. This did not prevent the dukes of Habsburg, who originally had had their homelands in the <a href="/wiki/Aargau" id="w">Aargau</a>, from trying to reassert their sovereignty over the territories south of the Rhine. </p>
<p>In the struggle for the crown of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" id="w">Holy Roman Empire</a> in 1314 between duke <a href="/wiki/Frederick_I_of_Austria_(Habsburg)" id="w">Frederick I of Austria</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Bavaria" id="w">Bavarian</a> king <a href="/wiki/Louis_IV%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Louis IV</a>, the <i>Waldstätten</i> sided with the <a href="/wiki/Wittelsbach" id="w">Wittelsbacher</a> for fear of the Habsburgs trying to annex their counties again, like Rudolph I had done. When a long-simmering conflict between <a href="/wiki/Schwyz" id="w">Schwyz</a> and the abbey of <a href="/wiki/Einsiedeln" id="w">Einsiedeln</a> escalated once more, the Habsburgs responded by sending a strong army of knights against these peasants to subdue their insurrection, but the Austrian army of Frederick&#39;s brother <a href="/wiki/Leopold_I_of_Austria_(Habsburg)" id="w">Leopold I</a> was utterly defeated in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Morgarten" id="w">Battle of Morgarten</a> in 1315. The three cantons renewed their alliance, and Louis IV reconfirmed their <i><a href="/wiki/Reichsfreiheit" id="w">Reichsfreiheit</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Expansion_to_the_''Acht_Orte''" name="Expansion_to_the_''Acht_Orte''"></a><h2>Expansion to the &#39;&#39;Acht Orte&#39;&#39;</h2>

<p>Subsequently, the three communities (their territories did not yet correspond to the areas of the modern-day <a href="/wiki/Canton_of_Switzerland" id="w">cantons</a>) followed a slow policy of expansion. Uri entered a pact with the previously Habsburg valley of <a href="/wiki/Urserental" id="w">Urseren</a> in 1317. In 1332, the city of <a href="/wiki/Lucerne" id="w">Lucerne</a>, trying to achieve <i>Reichsfreiheit</i> from the Habsburgs, joined the alliance. In 1351, these four forest communities (<i>Vier Waldstätten</i>, a name that lives on in the <a href="/wiki/German_language" id="w">German</a> name of <a href="/wiki/Lake_Lucerne" id="w">Lake Lucerne</a>) were joined by the city of <a href="/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich" id="w">Zürich</a>, where a strong citizenship had gained power following the installation of the <i>Zunftordnung</i> (<a href="/wiki/Guild" id="w">guild</a> laws) and the banning of the noble authorities in 1336. The city also sought support against the Habsburg city of <a href="/wiki/Rapperswil" id="w">Rapperswil</a>, which had tried to overthrow mayor <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Brun" id="w">Rudolf Brun</a> in Zürich in 1350. With the help of its new allies, Zürich was able to withstand the siege of duke <a href="/wiki/Albert_II_of_Austria" id="w">Albert II of Austria</a>, and the confederates even conquered the city of <a href="/wiki/Zug" id="w">Zug</a> and the valley of <a href="/wiki/Canton_of_Glarus" id="w">Glarus</a> in 1352. They had to return both Glarus and Zug to the Habsburgs in the peace treaty of Regensburg in 1356; emperor <a href="/wiki/Charles_IV%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Charles IV</a> in return recognized the <i>Zunftordnung</i> of Zürich and confirmed its <i>reichsfrei</i> status in spite of his having forbidden any confederations within the empire in his <a href="/wiki/Golden_Bull_of_1356" id="w">Golden Bull</a> issued in January of that same year.</p>
<p><div style="wigth:204px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:204px-Battle_of_Laupen.jpg" title="Illustration from the late fifteenth century of the [[Battle of Laupen]].

The <i><a href="/wiki/Eidgenossenschaft" id="w">Eidgenossenschaft</a></i> had signed &#34;perpetual&#34; alliances with both Glarus and Zug in 1352, and thus, even if these pacts apparently were disregarded only a few years later, this date is often considered the entry of these two cantons into the confederation despite their remaining under Habsburg rule for a few more years.<sup id="_ref-zug_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-zug" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the west, the <i>Vier Waldstätten</i> had already formed an alliance with the city of <a href="/wiki/Berne" id="w">Berne</a> in 1323, and even sent a detachment to help the Bernese forces in their territorial expansion against the <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Savoy" id="w">dukes of Savoy</a> and the Habsburgs in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Laupen" id="w">Battle of Laupen</a> in 1339. In 1353, Berne entered an &#34;eternal&#34; alliance with the confederation, completing the &#34;alliance of the eight places&#34; (<i>Bund der Acht Orte</i>).</p>
<p>This alliance of the <i>Acht Orte</i> was a not a homogeneous state but rather a conglomerate of eight independent cities and lands, held together not by one single pact but by a net of six different &#34;eternal&#34; pacts, none of which included all eight parties as signatories. Only the three <i>Waldstätten</i> Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden were part of all these treaties. All eight parties would still pursue their own particular interests, most notably in the cases of the strong cities of Zürich and Berne. Zürich was also part of an alliance of cities around <a href="/wiki/Lake_Constance" id="w">Lake Constance</a> which also included <a href="/wiki/Konstanz" id="w">Konstanz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lindau" id="w">Lindau</a> and <a href="/wiki/Schaffhausen" id="w">Schaffhausen</a> and for some time included cities as far away as <a href="/wiki/Rottweil" id="w">Rottweil</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ulm" id="w">Ulm</a>, and Berne followed its own hegemonial politics, participating successively in various alliances with other cities including <a href="/wiki/Fribourg" id="w">Fribourg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Murten" id="w">Murten</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biel" id="w">Biel</a> or <a href="/wiki/Solothurn" id="w">Solothurn</a>. This Bernese &#34;Burgundian Confederation&#34; was a more volatile construct of varying alliances, and in the Battle of Laupen, Fribourg even sided against Berne. Berne&#39;s position after that battle was strong enough that such alliances often ended with the other party becoming a Bernese dependency, as it happened with e.g. <a href="/wiki/Burgdorf%2C_Switzerland" id="w">Burgdorf</a> or <a href="/wiki/Payerne" id="w">Payerne</a>.</p>
<a id="Consolidation" name="Consolidation"></a><h2>Consolidation</h2>

<p>In 1364, <a href="/wiki/Schwyz" id="w">Schwyz</a> re-conquered the city and land of <a href="/wiki/Canton_of_Zug" id="w">Zug</a> and renewed the alliance the following year. In the 1380s, <a href="/wiki/Lucerne" id="w">Lucerne</a> expanded its territory aggressively, conquering <a href="/wiki/Wolhusen" id="w">Wolhusen</a>, claiming sovereignty over the valley of the <a href="/wiki/Entlebuch" id="w">Entlebuch</a> and the formerly Habsburg city of <a href="/wiki/Sempach" id="w">Sempach</a>. As a consequence, <a href="/wiki/Leopold_III_of_Austria_(Habsburg)" id="w">Leopold III of Austria</a> assembled an army and met the <i>Eidgenossen</i> near Sempach in 1386, where his troops were defeated decisively in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Sempach" id="w">Battle of Sempach</a> and he himself was killed. In the wake of these events <a href="/wiki/Glarus" id="w">Glarus</a> declared itself free and constituted its first <i><a href="/wiki/Landsgemeinde" id="w">Landsgemeinde</a></i> (regional <a href="/wiki/Diet_(assembly)" id="w">diet</a>) in 1387. In the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_N%C3%A4fels" id="w">Battle of Näfels</a> in 1388, an Austrian army of <a href="/wiki/Albert_III_of_Austria" id="w">Albert III</a>, the successor of Leopold, was defeated, and in the peace treaty concluded the next year, Glarus maintained its independence from the Habsburgs.</p>
<p>The loose federation of states was reinforced by additional agreements amongst the partners. In the <i><a href="/wiki/Pfaffenbrief" id="w">Pfaffenbrief</a></i> of 1370, the signatory six states (without Berne and Glarus) for the first time expressed themselves as a territorial unity, referring to themselves as <i>unser Eydgnosschaft</i>. They assumed in this document authority over clericals, subjecting them to their worldly legislation. Furthermore, the <i>Pfaffenbrief</i> forbade <a href="/wiki/Feud" id="w">feuds</a> and the parties pledged to guarantee the peace on the road from Zürich to the <a href="/wiki/St._Gotthard" id="w">St. Gotthard</a> pass. Another important treaty was the <i>Sempacherbrief</i> in 1393. Not only was this the first document signed by all eight of the <i>Acht Orte</i> (plus the associated Solothurn), but it also defined that none of them was to unilaterally start a war without the consent of all the others.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1401, the confederates supported the insurrection of <a href="/wiki/Appenzell" id="w">Appenzell</a> against the abbey of <a href="/wiki/St._Gallen" id="w">St. Gallen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frederick_IV_of_Austria" id="w">Frederick IV of Austria</a>, duke in <a href="/wiki/Tyrol" id="w">Tyrol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vorder%C3%B6sterreich" id="w">Vorderösterreich</a>. Appenzell became a protectorate of the <i>Acht Orte</i> in 1411, who concluded a 50-year peace with Frederick IV in 1412.</p>
<p>Emperor <a href="/wiki/Sigismund%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Sigismund</a> banned Frederick IV in 1415, who had sided with <a href="/wiki/Antipope_John_XXIII" id="w">Antipope John XXIII</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Constance" id="w">Council of Constance</a>, and encouraged others to take over the duke&#39;s possessions, amongst which was the <a href="/wiki/Aargau" id="w">Aargau</a>. After being granted far-reaching privileges by the emperor (all eight cantons became <i>reichsfrei</i>) and a decree that placed the ban over the peace treaty of 1412, the <i>Eidgenossen</i> conquered the Aargau. A large part became Bernese, while the <a href="/wiki/County_of_Baden" id="w">County of Baden</a> was subsequently administered by the confederation as a common property until 1798. Only the <a href="/wiki/Fricktal" id="w">Fricktal</a> remained Habsburgian.

<div class="thumbcaption">The Old Swiss Confederacy from 1291 to the sixteenth century.</div></div>

In the <a href="/wiki/Valais" id="w">Valais</a>, the conflict between the <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Sion" id="w">Bishop of Sion</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Savoy" id="w">Duchy of Savoy</a>, which had led to a separation in 1301 (the bishop controlling the upper Valais and the Savoyards the lower part), broke out again. Twice the Savoyards temporarily occupied the whole Valais, but both times they were ultimately defeated. Both peace treaties from 1361 and 1391 restored the <i>status quo</i> of 1301. As a result of these struggles, the villages in the upper Valais organized themselves in the <i>Sieben Zenden</i> (&#34;seven tenths&#34;) around 1355, emerging after these wars as largely independent small states, much like the cantons of the <i>Eidgenossenschaft</i>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Grisons" id="w">Grisons</a>, called <i>Churwalchen</i> then, the <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Chur" id="w">bishop of Chur</a> and numerous local noble families competed for the control of the region with its many alpine passes. Throughout the fourteenth century, three leagues of free communities appeared. The <i><a href="/wiki/Gotteshausbund" id="w">Gotteshausbund</a></i> (&#34;League of the House of God&#34;), covering the area around <a href="/wiki/Chur" id="w">Chur</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Engadin" id="w">Engadin</a>, was founded when the bishop in 1367 planned to hand over the administration of his diocese to the Austrian Habsburgs. It bought its freedom by paying the bishop&#39;s debt and in the following decades increased its control over the secular administration of the princebishopric, until the bishop&#39;s regent was deposed in 1452. In the upper valley of the <a href="/wiki/Rhine" id="w">Rhine</a>, the <i><a href="/wiki/Grauer_Bund" id="w">Grauer Bund</a></i> (&#34;Gray League&#34;) was founded in 1395 under the direction of the abbot of <a href="/wiki/Disentis_Abbey" id="w">Disentis</a> and including not only the peasant communities but also the local nobles to end the permanent <a href="/wiki/Feud" id="w">feuds</a> of the latter. By 1424 the Gray League was dominated by the free communities and gave itself a more democratic charter.</p>
<a id="Internal_crisis" name="Internal_crisis"></a><h2>Internal crisis</h2>

<p>The relationships between the individual cantons of the confederation were not without tensions, though. A first clash between Berne and the <i>Vier Waldstätten</i> over the Raron conflict (Berne supported the barons of Raron, while the forest cantons sided with the <i>Sieben Zenden</i>) in the upper <a href="/wiki/Valais" id="w">Valais</a> was barely avoided. The local noble barons of Raron established themselves as the leading family in the upper Valais in the late fourteenth century and competed with the bishop of Sion for the control of the valley. When emperor <a href="/wiki/Sigismund%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Sigismund</a> designated them counts in 1413 and ordered the bishop to hand over his territories to the <i>von Raron</i>, a revolt broke out in 1414. The following year, both rulers had lost: the <i>von Raron</i> had not succeeded in ousting the bishop, who in turn had to concede far-reaching rights to the <i>Sieben Zenden</i> in the treaty of Seta in 1415.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Old_Z%C3%BCrich_War" id="w">Old Zürich War</a>, which began as a dispute over the succession to the <a href="/wiki/Count_of_Toggenburg" id="w">count of Toggenburg</a>, was a more serious test of the unity of the <i>Acht Orte</i>. Zürich did not accept the claims of Schwyz and Glarus, which were supported by the rest of the cantons, and in 1438 declared an <a href="/wiki/Embargo" id="w">embargo</a>. The other members of the confederation expelled Zürich from the confederation in 1440 and declared war. In retaliation Zürich made a pact with the Habsburgs in 1442. The other cantons invaded the canton of Zürich and besieged the city, but were unable to capture it. By 1446, both sides were exhausted, and a preliminary peace was concluded. In 1450, the parties made a definitive peace and Zürich was admitted into the confederation again, but had to dissolve its alliance with the Habsburgs.  The confederation had grown into a political alliance so close that it no longer tolerated separatist tendencies of its members.</p>
<p>The end of the dynasty of the counts of Toggenburg in 1436 also had effects on the <a href="/wiki/Grisons" id="w">Grisons</a>. In their former territories in the <a href="/wiki/Pr%C3%A4ttigau" id="w">Prättigau</a> and <a href="/wiki/Davos" id="w">Davos</a>, the (initially eleven, after a merger only ten) villages founded the <i><a href="/wiki/Zehngerichtebund" id="w">Zehngerichtebund</a></i> (&#34;League of the Ten Jurisdictions&#34;). By 1471, the three leagues, together with the city of <a href="/wiki/Chur" id="w">Chur</a>, had formed a close federation, based on military assistance and free trade pacts between the partners and  including a common federal diet: the <i>Drei Bünde</i> was born, even though the alliance would be officially concluded in a written contract only in 1524.</p>
<a id="Further_expansion" name="Further_expansion"></a><h2>Further expansion</h2>

<p>In the second half of the fifteenth century, the confederation expanded its territory further. In the north, the formerly Habsburg cities of <a href="/wiki/Schaffhausen" id="w">Schaffhausen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stein_am_Rhein" id="w">Stein am Rhein</a> had become <i>reichsfrei</i> in 1415, with the ban of Frederick IV. The two strategically important cities&#8212;they offered the only two fortified bridges over the river <a href="/wiki/Rhine" id="w">Rhine</a> between Constance and Basel&#8212;not only struggled with the <a href="/wiki/Robber_baron" id="w">robber barons</a> from the neighbouring <a href="/wiki/Hegau" id="w">Hegau</a> region but also were under pressure from the Habsburg dukes, who sought to re-integrate the cities into their domain. On <a href="/wiki/June_1" id="w">June 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1454" id="w">1454</a>, Schaffhausen became an associate (<i>Zugewandter Ort</i>) of the confederacy by entering an alliance with six of the eight cantons (Uri and Unterwalden did not participate). With the help of the confederates, a Habsburg army of about 2,000 men was warded off east of <a href="/wiki/Thayngen" id="w">Thayngen</a>. Stein am Rhein concluded a similar alliance on <a href="/wiki/December_6" id="w">December 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1459" id="w">1459</a>.</p>
<p>The city of <a href="/wiki/St._Gallen" id="w">St. Gallen</a> had also become free in 1415, but was in a conflict with its <a href="/wiki/Abbey_of_St._Gall" id="w">abbot</a>, who tried to bring it under his influence. But as the Habsburg dukes were unable to support him in any way, he was forced to seek help from the confederates, and the abbey became a protectorate of the confederacy on <a href="/wiki/August_17" id="w">August 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1451" id="w">1451</a>. The city was accepted as an associate state on <a href="/wiki/June_13" id="w">June 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1454" id="w">1454</a>. <a href="/wiki/Fribourg" id="w">Fribourg</a>, another Habsburg city, came under the rule of the <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Savoy" id="w">Duke of Savoy</a> during the 1440s and had to accept the duke as its lord in 1452. Nevertheless, it also entered an alliance with Berne in 1454, becoming an associate state, too. Two other cities also sought help from the <i>Eidgenossen</i> against the Habsburgs: <a href="/wiki/Rottweil" id="w">Rottweil</a> became as associate on <a href="/wiki/June_18" id="w">June 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1463" id="w">1463</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mulhouse" id="w">Mülhausen</a> on <a href="/wiki/June_17" id="w">June 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1466" id="w">1466</a> through an alliance with Berne (and Solothurn). In <a href="/wiki/Rapperswil" id="w">Rapperswil</a>, a Habsburg <a href="/wiki/Enclave" id="w">enclave</a> on <a href="/wiki/Lake_Z%C3%BCrich" id="w">Lake Zürich</a> within confederate territory, a pro-confederate coup d&#39;état in 1458 led to the city becoming a protectorate of the confederacy in 1464.</p>
<p>Duke <a href="/wiki/Sigismund_of_Austria" id="w">Sigismund of Austria</a> got involved in a power struggle with <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_II" id="w">Pope Pius II</a> over the nomination of a bishop in Tyrol in 1460. When the duke was banned by the pope, a situation similar to that of 1415 arose. The confederates took advantage of the problems of the Habsburgs and conquered the Habsburg <a href="/wiki/Thurgau" id="w">Thurgau</a> and the region of <a href="/wiki/Sargans" id="w">Sargans</a> in the autumn of 1460, which became both commonly administered property. In a peace treaty from <a href="/wiki/June_1" id="w">June 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1461" id="w">1461</a>, the duke had no choice but to accept the new situation.</p>
<p>The Swiss also had an interest in extending their influence south of the <a href="/wiki/Alps" id="w">Alps</a> to secure the trade route across the <a href="/wiki/St._Gotthard_Pass" id="w">St. Gotthard Pass</a> to <a href="/wiki/Milan" id="w">Milan</a>. Beginning in 1331, they initially exerted their influence through peaceful trade agreements, but in the fifteenth century, their involvement turned military. 1403 the upper <a href="/wiki/Leventina" id="w">Leventina</a>, as the valley south of the pass is called, became a protectorate of Uri. Throughout the fifteenth century, a changeful struggle between the Swiss and the <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Milan" id="w">Duchy of Milan</a> ensued. In 1439, Uri assumed full control of the upper Leventina; the Duchy of Milan gave up its claims there two years later, and so did the <a href="/wiki/Chapter_(religion)" id="w">chapter</a> of Milan in 1477. Twice the Swiss conquered roughly the whole territory of the modern canton of <a href="/wiki/Ticino" id="w">Ticino</a> and also the <a href="/wiki/Ossola" id="w">Ossola</a> valley. Twice, the Milanese reconquered all these territories except the Leventina. Both times, the Swiss managed, despite their defeats, to negotiate peace treaties that were actually favorable for them.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Burgundy_Wars" id="w">Burgundy Wars</a> were an involvement of confederate forces in the conflict between the <a href="/wiki/Valois_Dynasty" id="w">Valois Dynasty</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Habsburgs" id="w">Habsburgs</a>. The aggressive expansionism of the <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Burgundy" id="w">Duke of Burgundy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_the_Bold" id="w">Charles the Bold</a>, brought him in conflict with both the <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a> king <a href="/wiki/Louis_XI_of_France" id="w">Louis XI</a> and emperor <a href="/wiki/Frederick_III%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Frederick III</a> of the House of Habsburg. His embargo politics against the cities of Basel, <a href="/wiki/Strasbourg" id="w">Strasbourg</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mulhouse" id="w">Mulhouse</a> prompted these to turn to Berne for help.</p>
<p>The conflicts culminated in 1474, after duke <a href="/wiki/Sigismund_of_Austria" id="w">Sigismund of Austria</a> had concluded a peace agreement with the confederates in Constance (later called the <i>Ewige Richtung</i>). The confederates, united with the Alsatian cities and Sigismund in an &#34;anti-burgundian league&#34;, conquered part of the Burgundian Jura (<a href="/wiki/Franche-Comt%C3%A9" id="w">Franche-Comté</a>), and the next year, Bernese forces conquered and ravaged the <a href="/wiki/Vaud" id="w">Vaud</a>, which belonged to the <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Savoy" id="w">Duchy of Savoy</a>, which in turn was allied with Charles the Bold. The <i>Sieben Zenden</i>, with the help of Bernese and other confederate forces, drove the Savoyards out of the lower Valais after a victory in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_on_the_Planta" id="w">Battle on the Planta</a> in November 1475. In 1476, Charles retaliated and marched to <a href="/wiki/Grandson%2C_Switzerland" id="w">Grandson</a> with his army, but suffered three devastating defeats in a row, first in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Grandson" id="w">Battle of Grandson</a>, then in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Murten" id="w">Battle of Murten</a>, until he was killed in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Nancy" id="w">Battle of Nancy</a> in 1477, where the confederates fought alongside an army of <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_II%2C_Duke_of_Lorraine" id="w">René II</a>, <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Lorraine" id="w">Duke of Lorraine</a>.<sup id="_ref-bwars_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bwars" title="">[2]</a></sup> There is a proverbial saying in Switzerland summarizing these events as <i>&#34;Bi Grandson s&#39;Guet, bi Murte de Muet, bi Nancy s&#39;Bluet&#34; (hät de Karl de Küeni verloore)</i> (&#34;[Charles the Bold lost] his goods at Grandson, his boldness at Murten and his blood at Nancy&#34;).</p>
<p>As a result of the Burgundy Wars, the dynasty of the <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Burgundy" id="w">dukes of Burgundy</a> had died out. Berne returned the Vaud to the duchy of Savoy against a <a href="/wiki/Ransom" id="w">ransom</a> of 50&#39;000 <a href="/wiki/Guilder" id="w">guilders</a> already in 1476, and sold its claims on the <a href="/wiki/Franche-Comt%C3%A9" id="w">Franche-Comté</a> to <a href="/wiki/Louis_XI_of_France" id="w">Louis XI</a> for 150&#39;000 guilders in 1479. The confederates only kept small territories east of the <a href="/wiki/Jura_mountains" id="w">Jura mountains</a>, especially Grandson and Murten, as common dependencies of Berne and Fribourg. The whole Valais, however, would henceforth be independent, and Berne would reconquer the Vaud in 1536. While the territorial effects of the Burgundy Wars on the confederation were minor, they marked the beginning of the rise of Swiss mercenaries on the battlefields of Europe.</p>

In the Burgundy Wars, the Swiss soldiers had gained a reputation of near invincibility, and their <a href="/wiki/Mercenary" id="w">mercenary</a> services became increasingly sought after by the great European political powers of the time. </p>
<p>Shortly after the Burgundy Wars, individual cantons concluded mercenary contracts, so-called &#34;<a href="/wiki/Capitulation_(treaty)" id="w">capitulations</a>&#34;, with many parties, including the <a href="/wiki/Pope" id="w">Pope</a> &#8212; the papal <a href="/wiki/Swiss_Guard" id="w">Swiss Guard</a> was founded in 1505 and became operational the next year.  More contracts were made with <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> (a Swiss Guard of mercenaries would be destroyed in the storm of the <a href="/wiki/Tuileries_Palace" id="w">Tuileries</a> in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> in 1792), the <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Savoy" id="w">Duchy of Savoy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austria</a>, and still others.  <a href="/wiki/Swiss_Mercenaries" id="w">Swiss mercenaries</a> would play an initially important, but later minor role on European battlefields until well into the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Swiss forces soon got involved in the <a href="/wiki/Italian_Wars" id="w">Italian Wars</a> between the Valois and the Habsburgs over the control of northern <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>. When the power of the <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Milan" id="w">Duchy of Milan</a> perished in these wars, the Swiss finally managed to bring the whole <a href="/wiki/Ticino" id="w">Ticino</a> under their control. In 1500, they occupied the strategically important fortress of <a href="/wiki/Bellinzona" id="w">Bellinzona</a>, which the French king <a href="/wiki/Louis_XII_of_France" id="w">Louis XII</a>, who ruled Milan at that time, ceded definitively in 1503. From 1512 on, the confederates fought on the side of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Julius_II" id="w">Pope Julius II</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Catholic_League_(Italian)" id="w">Holy League</a> against the French in territories south of the Alps.  After initial successes and having conquered large parts of the territory of <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Milan" id="w">Milan</a>, they were utterly defeated by a French army in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Marignano" id="w">Battle of Marignano</a> in 1515, which put an end to military territorial interventions of the confederation, mercenary services under the flags of foreign armies excepted.  The result of this short intermezzo were the gain of the <a href="/wiki/Ticino" id="w">Ticino</a> as a common administrative region of the confederacy and the occupation of the valley of the Adda river (<a href="/wiki/Veltlin" id="w">Veltlin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bormio" id="w">Bormio</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Chiavenna" id="w">Chiavenna</a>) by the <i>Drei Bünde</i>, which would remain a dependency of the <a href="/wiki/Grisons" id="w">Grisons</a> until 1797 with a brief interruption during the <a href="/wiki/Thirty_Years%26%2339%3B_War" id="w">Thirty Years&#39; War</a>.</p>

<p>Both Fribourg and Solothurn, which had participated in the Burgundy Wars, wanted to join the confederation following the war, which would have tipped the balance in favour of the city cantons. The rural cantons were thus strongly opposed. In 1477 they marched upon the cities in protest.</p>
<p>At <a href="/wiki/Stans" id="w">Stans</a> in 1481 a <i><a href="/wiki/Tagsatzung" id="w">Tagsatzung</a></i> was held in order to resolve the issues, but war seemed inevitable!  A local hermit, <a href="/wiki/Niklaus_von_der_Fl%C3%BCe" id="w">Niklaus von der Flüe</a>, was consulted on the situation. He requested that a message be passed on to the members of the <i><a href="/wiki/Tagsatzung" id="w">Tagsatzung</a></i> on his behalf. The details of the message have remained unknown to this day, however it did calm the tempers and led to the drawing up of the <i><a href="/wiki/Stanser_Verkommnis" id="w">Stanser Verkommnis</a></i>. Fribourg and Solothurn were admitted into the confederation.</p>
<p>After isolated bilateral pacts between the leagues in the <a href="/wiki/Grisons" id="w">Grisons</a> and some cantons of the confederation had already existed since the early fifteenth century, the federation of the <a href="/wiki/Three_Leagues" id="w">Three Leagues</a> as a whole became an associate state of the confederation, in 1498, by concluding alliance agreements with the seven easternmost cantons.</p>
<p>When the confederates refused to accept the resolutions of the <a href="/wiki/Reichstag_(institution)" id="w">Reichstag</a> of 1495 in <a href="/wiki/Worms%2C_Germany" id="w">Worms</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Swabian_War" id="w">Swabian War</a>  (<i>Schwabenkrieg</i>, also called the <i>Schweizerkrieg</i> in Germany) broke out in 1499, opposing the confederation against the <a href="/wiki/Swabian_League" id="w">Swabian League</a> and emperor <a href="/wiki/Maximilian_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Maximilian I</a>. After some battles around Schaffhausen, in the Austrian <a href="/wiki/Vorarlberg" id="w">Vorarlberg</a> and in the <a href="/wiki/Grisons" id="w">Grisons</a>, where the confederates were victorious more often than not, the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Dornach" id="w">Battle of Dornach</a>, where the  emperor&#39;s commander was killed, put an end to the war. In September 1499, a peace agreement was concluded at Basel that effectively established a <i>de facto</i> independence of the <i>Eidgenossenschaft</i> from the empire, although it continued nominally to be part of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" id="w">Holy Roman Empire</a> until after the <a href="/wiki/Thirty_Years%26%2339%3B_War" id="w">Thirty Years&#39; War</a> and was not included into the system of <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Circle" id="w">Imperial Circles</a> in 1500.</p>  
<p>As a direct consequence of the Swabian War the previously associated city states of <a href="/wiki/Basel" id="w">Basel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Schaffhausen" id="w">Schaffhausen</a> joined the confederation in 1501. In 1513, the <a href="/wiki/Appenzell" id="w">Appenzell</a> followed suit as the thirteenth member. The cities of <a href="/wiki/St._Gallen" id="w">St. Gallen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biel" id="w">Biel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mulhouse" id="w">Mulhouse</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rottweil" id="w">Rottweil</a> as well as the Three Leagues in the Grisons were all associates of the confederation (<i>Zugewandte Orte</i>); the Valais would become an associate state in 1529.</p>

The events told in the saga of <a href="/wiki/William_Tell" id="w">William Tell</a>, which are purported to have occurred around 1307, are not substantiated by historical evidence. This story, like the related story of the <i><a href="/wiki/R%C3%BCtlischwur" id="w">Rütlischwur</a></i> (the oath on the <i>Rütli</i>, a meadow above <a href="/wiki/Lake_Lucerne" id="w">Lake Lucerne</a>), seems to have its origins in the late fifteenth century <i>Weisse Buch von Sarnen</i>, a collection of folk tales from 1470, and is generally considered a fictitious glorification of the independence struggles of the <i>Waldstätten</i>. </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Legend" id="w">legend</a> of <a href="/wiki/Arnold_von_Winkelried" id="w">Arnold von Winkelried</a> likewise is first recorded in the sixteenth century; earlier accounts of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Sempach" id="w">Battle of Sempach</a> do not mention him. Winkelried is said to have opened a breach in the lines of the Austrian footsoldiers by throwing himself into their <a href="/wiki/Lance" id="w">lances</a>, taking them down with his body such that the confederates could attack through the opening.</p>
<a id="Social_developments" name="Social_developments"></a><h1>Social developments</h1>

<p>The developments beginning in about the thirteenth century had profound effects on the society. Gradually the population of <a href="/wiki/Serf" id="w">serfs</a> changed into one of free peasants and <a href="/wiki/Citizen" id="w">citizens</a>. In the cities&#8212;which were small by modern standards; Basel had about 10,000 inhabitants, Zürich, Berne, Lausanne, and Fribourg about 5,000 each&#8212;the development was a natural one, for the <a href="/wiki/Liege_lord" id="w">liege lords</a> very soon gave the cities a certain autonomy, in particular over their internal administration. At the beginning of the fourteenth century, the artisans in the cities began forming <a href="/wiki/Guild" id="w">guilds</a> and increasingly took over political control, especially in the cities along the Rhine, e.g. in the Alsace, in Basel, Schaffhausen, Zürich, or Chur. (But not, for instance, in Bern or Lucerne&#8212;or, in Germany, Frankfurt&#8212;where a stronger aristocracy seems to have inhibited such a development.) The guild cities had a relatively democratic structure, with a city council elected by the citizens.</p>
<p>In the rural areas, people generally had less freedom, but some lords furthered the colonization of remote areas by granting some privileges to the colonists. One well-known colonization movement was that of the <a href="/wiki/Walser" id="w">Walser</a> from the Valais to the Grisons, colonizing some valleys there in the fourteenth century. In the mountainous areas, a community management of common fields, alps, and forests (the latter being important as a protection against <a href="/wiki/Avalanches" id="w">avalanches</a>) soon developed, and the communes in a valley cooperated closely and began buying out the noble landowners or simply to dispossess them of their lands. Regional diets, the <i><a href="/wiki/Landsgemeinde" id="w">Landsgemeinden</a></i>, were formed to deal with the administration of the commons; it also served as the high court and to elect representatives, the <i><a href="/wiki/Landamman" id="w">Landamman</a></i>.</p>

Although both poor and rich citizens or peasants had the same rights (though not the same status), not all people were equal. Immigrants into a village or city had no political rights and were called the <i>Hintersassen</i>. In rural areas, they had to pay for their use of the common lands. They were granted equal rights only when they acquired the citizenship, which not only was a question of wealth (for they had to buy their citizenship), but they also had to have lived there for some time; especially in the rural areas.<sup id="_ref-hintersassen_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hintersassen" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/City" id="w">cities</a> followed an expansionist territorial politics to gain control over the surrounding rural areas, on which they were dependent, using military powers or more often more subtle means such as buying out, or accepting as citizens the subjects (and thereby freeing them: <i>&#34;Stadtluft macht frei&#34;</i>&#8212;&#34;city air liberates&#34;) of a <a href="/wiki/Liege_lord" id="w">liege lord</a>. It was the cities, now, that instituted reeves to manage the administration, but this only sometimes and slowly led to a restriction of the communal autonomy of the villages. The peasants owned their land, the villages kept administering their commons; and the villagers participated in the jury of the city reeve&#39;s court. They had, however, to provide military service for the city, which on the other hand included the right to own and carry weapons.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Basel" id="w">Basel</a> became the center of higher education and science in the second half of the fifteenth century. The city had hosted the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Basel" id="w">Council of Basel</a> from 1431 to 1447, and, in 1460, a university was founded, which eventually would attract many notable thinkers, such as <a href="/wiki/Erasmus" id="w">Erasmus</a> or <a href="/wiki/Paracelsus" id="w">Paracelsus</a>.</p>
<a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2>Economy</h2>

<p>The population of the cantons numbered about 600,000 in the 1400s and grew to about 800,000 by the 1500s. The grain production sufficed only in some of the lower regions; most areas were dependent on imports of <a href="/wiki/Oat" id="w">oats</a>, <a href="/wiki/Barley" id="w">barley</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Wheat" id="w">wheat</a>. In the Alps, where the yield of grains had always been particularly low due to the climatic conditions, a transition from farming to the production of cheese and butter from cow milk occurred. As the roads got better and safer, a lively trade with the cities developed.</p>
<p>The cities were the marketplaces and important trading centers, being located on the major roads through the Alps.  <a href="/wiki/Textile" id="w">Textile</a> manufacture, where St. Gallen was the leading center, developed.  <a href="/wiki/Cheese" id="w">Cheese</a> (esp. <a href="/wiki/Emmentaler" id="w">Emmentaler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gruy%C3%A8re" id="w">Gruyère</a>) also was a major export item.  The exports of the Swiss cities went far, into the <a href="/wiki/Levant" id="w">Levant</a> or to <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Poland</a>.</p>
<p>In the late fifteenth century, the <a href="/wiki/Mercenary" id="w">mercenary</a> services became also an important economic factor.  The <i>Reisläuferei</i>, as the mercenary service was called, attracted many young adventurous Swiss who saw in it a way to escape the relative poverty of their homes.  Not only the mercenaries themselves were paid, but also their home cantons, and the <i>Reisläuferei</i>, while being heavily criticized already at that time as a heavy drain on the human resources of the confederation, became popular in particular among the young peasants from the rural cantons.</p>
<a id="Political_organization" name="Political_organization"></a><h2>Political organization</h2>

<p>Initially, the <i>Eidgenossenschaft</i> was not united by one single pact, but rather by a whole set of overlapping pacts and separate bilateral treaties between various members, with only minimum liabilities.  The parties generally agreed to preserve the peace in their territories, help each other in military endeavours, and defined some arbitration in case of disputes.  The <i>Sempacherbrief</i> from 1393 was the first treaty uniting all eight cantons, and subsequently, a kind of federal <a href="/wiki/Diet_(assembly)" id="w">diet</a>, the <i>Tagsatzung</i> developed in the fifteenth century. The second unifying treaty later became the <i><a href="/wiki/Stanser_Verkommnis" id="w">Stanser Verkommnis</a></i> in 1481.</p>
<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Tagsatzung" id="w">Tagsatzung</a></i> typically met several times a year.  Each canton delegated two representatives; typically this also included the associate states.  Initially, the canton where the delegates met chaired the gathering, but in the sixteenth century, Zürich permanently assumed the chair (<i>Vorort</i>), and Baden became the sessional seat.<sup id="_ref-tagsatzung_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tagsatzung" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>Tagsatzung</i> dealt with all inter-cantonal affairs and also served as the final arbitral court to settle disputes between member states, or to decide on sanctions against dissenting members, as happened in the <a href="/wiki/Old_Z%C3%BCrich_War" id="w">Old Zürich War</a>.  It also organized and oversaw the administration of the commons such as the <a href="/wiki/County_of_Baden" id="w">County of Baden</a> and the neighbouring <a href="/wiki/Freiamt" id="w">Freiamt</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Thurgau" id="w">Thurgau</a>, in the Rhine valley between Lake Constance and Chur, or those in the <a href="/wiki/Ticino" id="w">Ticino</a>.  The reeves for these commons were delegated for two years, each time by a different canton.</p>
<p>Despite its informal character (there was no formal legal base describing its competencies), the <i>Tagsatzung</i> was an important instrument of the eight, later thirteen cantons to decide inter-cantonal matters.  It also proved instrumental in the development of a sense of unity among these sometimes highly individual cantons.  Slowly, they defined themselves as the <i><a href="/wiki/Eidgenossenschaft" id="w">Eidgenossenschaft</a></i> and considered themselves less as thirteen separate states with only loose bonds between.</p>
