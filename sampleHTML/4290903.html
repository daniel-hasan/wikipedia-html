<p>It was initially suspected that the rains were coloured by fallout from a hypothetical meteor burst, but a study commissioned by the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_India" id="w">Government of India</a> found that the rains had been coloured by airborne spores from a locally prolific terrestrial <a href="/wiki/Algae" id="w">alga</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Then in early 2006, the coloured rains of Kerala suddenly rose to worldwide attention after media reports of a conjecture that the coloured particles were <a href="/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" id="w">extraterrestrial</a> cells, proposed by <a href="/wiki/Godfrey_Louis" id="w">Godfrey Louis</a> and Santhosh Kumar of the <a href="/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi_University" id="w">Mahatma Gandhi University</a> in <a href="/wiki/Kottayam" id="w">Kottayam</a>.

The coloured rain of Kerala first fell on <a href="/wiki/25_July" id="w">25 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>, in the districts of Kottayam and <a href="/wiki/Idukki" id="w">Idukki</a> in the southern part of the state. Some reports suggested that other colours of rain were also seen.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Many more occurrences of the red rain were reported over the following ten days, and then with diminishing frequency until late September.</p>
<p>According to locals, the first coloured rain was preceded by a loud <a href="/wiki/Thunder" id="w">thunderclap</a> and flash of light, and followed by groves of trees shedding shrivelled grey &#34;burnt&#34; leaves.  Shrivelled leaves and the disappearance and sudden formation of <a href="/wiki/Water_well" id="w">wells</a> were also reported around the same time in the area.<sup id="_ref-indiatoday_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-indiatoday" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-timesofindia 20010806_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timesofindia 20010806" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-timesofindia 20010805_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timesofindia 20010805" title="">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The colouration of the rain was due to red particles in <a href="/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)" id="w">suspension</a> in the rain water, and the red rain was at times as strongly coloured as <a href="/wiki/Blood" id="w">blood</a>. It typically fell over small areas, no more than a few <a href="/wiki/Square_kilometre" id="w">square kilometres</a> in size, and was sometimes so localised that normal rain could be falling just a few metres away from the red rain. Red rainfalls typically lasted less than 20 minutes.<sup id="_ref-L&K 2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-L&K 2006" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

Initially the <a href="/wiki/Centre_for_Earth_Science_Studies" id="w">Centre for Earth Science Studies</a> (CESS) had suggested that the cause of the red rain was an exploding meteor. A few days later, when the red rain continued to fall, they retracted this. (Clearly debris from a meteor wouldn&#39;t have continued to fall in the same area.) Instead, the announcement jointly from the CESS and the <a href="/wiki/Tropical_Botanical_Garden_and_Research_Institute" id="w">Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute</a> (TBGRI) concluded that the particles colouring the rainwater were some type of <a href="/wiki/Spore" id="w">spore</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>  Then in November of 2001, commissioned by the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_India" id="w">Government of India</a>&#39;s Department of Science &#38; Technology, the CESS and TBGRI released a report which concluded that Kerala&#39;s rains were coloured by <a href="/wiki/Algae" id="w">algal</a> spores, which were successfully grown in medium into <a href="/wiki/Lichen" id="w">lichen</a> associated algae of the genus <i><a href="/wiki/Trentepohlia" id="w">Trentepohlia</a></i>. Although red or orange, <i>Trentepohlia</i> is a <a href="/wiki/Chlorophyta" id="w">Chlorophyte</a> green alga which can grow abundantly on tree bark or damp soil and rocks, but is also the photosynthetic <a href="/wiki/Symbiosis" id="w">symbiont</a> or photobiont of many lichens, including some of those abundant on the trees in <a href="/wiki/Changanacherry" id="w">Changanacherry</a> area.<sup id="_ref-Sampath_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sampath" title="">[11]</a></sup>  </p>

The report also stated that there was no dust of meteoric, volcanic or desert origin present in the rainwater, and that the colour of the rainwater was not due to any dissolved gases or pollutants. The report suggested that heavy rains in Kerala in the weeks preceding the red rains could have caused the widespread growth of lichens, which had given rise to a large quantity of spores in the atmosphere. However, it found no definite mechanism for the apparent extraordinary dispersal of the suspect spores, nor for the uptake of the suspect spores into clouds.</p>
<p>The authors of the report analysed some sediment collected from the red rains, using a combination of ion-coupled plasma <a href="/wiki/Mass_Spectrometer" id="w">mass spectrometry</a>, atomic absorption spectrometry and wet chemical methods. The major elements found are listed below.</p>

<p>The presence of aluminium and the very low content of <a href="/wiki/Phosphorus" id="w">phosphorus</a> is puzzling because aluminium is not ordinarily found in living cells, while normally about 3% phosphorus can be expected in the dry weight of biological cells.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>History records many instances of unusual objects falling with the rain — in 2000, in an example of <a href="/wiki/Raining_animals" id="w">raining animals</a>, a small <a href="/wiki/Waterspout" id="w">waterspout</a> in the <a href="/wiki/North_Sea" id="w">North Sea</a> sucked up a school of <a href="/wiki/Fish" id="w">fish</a> a mile off shore, depositing them shortly afterwards on <a href="/wiki/Great_Yarmouth" id="w">Great Yarmouth</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Coloured rain is by no means rare, and can often be explained by the transport of <a href="/wiki/Dust" id="w">dust</a> from <a href="/wiki/Desert" id="w">desert</a> regions in <a href="/wiki/High_pressure_area" id="w">high pressure areas</a>, where it mixes with water droplets.  One such case occurred in <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> in 1903, when dust was carried from the <a href="/wiki/Sahara" id="w">Sahara</a> and fell with rain in February of that year.</p>
<p>At first, the red rain in Kerala was attributed to the same effect, with dust from the deserts of <a href="/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula" id="w">Arabia</a> initially the suspect.  <a href="/wiki/LIDAR" id="w">LIDAR</a> observations had detected a cloud of dust in the atmosphere near Kerala in the days preceding the outbreak of the red rain <sup id="_ref-Satyanarayana_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Satyanarayana" title="">[14]</a></sup>.  However, this hypothesis could not explain certain aspects of the red rain, such as its sudden onset and gradual decline over two months, and its localisation to Kerala despite atmospheric conditions that should have seen it occur in neighbouring states as well.</p>
<p>Another theory is that the rain contained mammalian blood, a large flock of <a href="/wiki/Bat" id="w">bats</a> having been killed at high altitude, perhaps by a <a href="/wiki/Meteor" id="w">meteor</a>{{Fact}}. Some bat species in India live in very large communities. However, no bat wings or other remains were found raining from the sky, and no known natural process would separate the red blood cells from white cells, platelets and other blood components. Red blood cells disintegrate rapidly in regular rainwater because of osmosis, but this was not evident with the red particles.<sup id="_ref-tmcnet 2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tmcnet 2006" title="">[15]</a></sup>  Furthermore it would have had to be a sizeable quantity of bats to cover a province of India.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>Another hypothesis was proposed in 2003 by <a href="/wiki/Godfrey_Louis" id="w">Godfrey Louis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Santhosh_Kumar" id="w">A.

Having collected samples of the <a href="/wiki/Rainwater" id="w">rainwater</a> at many locations, Louis and Kumar claimed that the red particles did not look like dust but instead appeared to be biological cells. <a href="/wiki/Chemical" id="w">Chemical</a> analyses indicate that they consist of <a href="/wiki/Organic_material" id="w">organic material</a>, and so they proposed that the particles may be <a href="/wiki/Microbes" id="w">microbes</a> of <a href="/wiki/Outer_space" id="w">extraterrestrial</a> origin.</p>
<p>Louis and Kumar&#39;s analysis found that the red particles were typically 4 to 10 <a href="/wiki/Micrometre" id="w">µm</a> across, spherical or oval in shape, and similar in appearance to <a href="/wiki/Unicellular_organism" id="w">unicellular organisms</a>. On average, 1 <a href="/wiki/Millilitre" id="w">millilitre</a> of rain water was found to contain 9 million <a href="/wiki/Red" id="w">red</a> particles, and the weight of particles in each <a href="/wiki/Litre" id="w">litre</a> of rainwater was about 100 <a href="/wiki/Milligram" id="w">milligrams</a>. <a href="/wiki/Extrapolating" id="w">Extrapolating</a> these figures to the total amount of red rain estimated to have fallen, Louis and Kumar calculated that a total weight of some 50,000 <a href="/wiki/Kilogram" id="w">kilograms</a> of red particles had fallen over <a href="/wiki/Kerala" id="w">Kerala</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Energy_dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy" id="w">Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy</a> analysis showed that the particles were composed of mostly <a href="/wiki/Carbon" id="w">carbon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" id="w">oxygen</a>, with trace amounts of <a href="/wiki/Silicon" id="w">silicon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Iron" id="w">iron</a> (see table). </p>

A few hours before the first occurrence of the red rain, a <a href="/wiki/Sonic_boom" id="w">sonic boom</a> was reported by residents of <a href="/wiki/Changanasserry" id="w">Changanasserry</a> in Kottayam district, accompanied by a flash of light. Louis and Kumar suggest that this was caused by the disintegration of a small <a href="/wiki/Comet" id="w">comet</a> entering the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, and that this comet contained large quantities of the red particles. Observations show that 85% of the red rain fell within 10 days of <a href="/wiki/25_July" id="w">25 July</a>, and Louis and Kumar suggest that this is consistent with the settling of red particles released into the upper atmosphere by a cometary break-up.
