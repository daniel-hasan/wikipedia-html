<a id="1973%26ndash%3B1993:_Childhood" name="1973%26ndash%3B1993:_Childhood"></a><h3>1973&#8211;1993: Childhood</h3>
<p>Knight attended Woodfield Infants and Junior School and Highfields Science Specialist School In Wolverhampton.
Knight was born of <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" id="w">Jamaican</a> parents, and she grew up in a strict <a href="/wiki/Pentecostal" id="w">Pentecostal</a> household where church attendance was commonplace. It is here where she began her singing career: &#34;the first time I heard music would have been in church. My mum was often called upon: &#39;Come on sister Dolores. Lead us in song!&#39; Singing was the most natural thing in the world. I thought, doesn&#39;t everybody&#39;s mum lead the congregation at church in song?&#34;<sup id="_ref-guardian_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardian" title="">[4]</a></sup> Knight continued singing in her local church throughout her childhood, and her musical education was continued at home where she was often exposed to <a href="/wiki/Gospel" id="w">gospel</a> music.  Due to her parents&#39; religious beliefs, secular music was largely frowned upon but artists such as <a href="/wiki/Sam_Cooke" id="w">Sam Cooke</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aretha_Franklin" id="w">Aretha Franklin</a> played a big part in her childhood.<sup id="_ref-guardian_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardian" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Knight began writing her own songs – with varying degrees of success – at the age of thirteen. It was not until she turned seventeen, though, that she began to take her craft seriously. Beverley began performing the songs that she had written on stage in local clubs in her hometown. At the age of nineteen, Beverley was heard singing jingles on her local radio station by a record company executive and was offered a recording contract.  She was adamant that her education should come first and that she should have something to fall back on, and so went to university to study Religious Theology and Philosophy: &#34;so I told them that they’d have to wait&#34;.<sup id="_ref-3g_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3g" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="1994%26ndash%3B2000:_Early_success" name="1994%26ndash%3B2000:_Early_success"></a><h3> 1994&#8211;2000: Early success </h3>

<p>In late 1994, Beverley Knight signed a record deal with Dome Records – a small, independent label that was home to artists such as <a href="/wiki/Lulu_(singer)" id="w">Lulu</a> and Hil St Soul. Shortly after, Beverley went in studio to write and record her debut album. The backbone of the project was produced by <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> production trio 2B3, with additional beats provided by Don E (Beverley’s cousin), Ethnic Boyz and hip-hop act <a href="/wiki/Blak_Twang" id="w">Blak Twang</a>. Also <a href="/wiki/Klarmann/Weber" id="w">Klarmann/Weber</a> the German songwriter/producer team (<a href="/wiki/Chaka_Khan" id="w">Chaka Khan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Randy_Crawford" id="w">Randy Crawford</a>) contributed two songs.The result was the critically acclaimed album <i><a href="/wiki/The_B-Funk" id="w">The B-Funk</a></i> – hailed as &#34;the best British soul album ever&#34;<sup id="_ref-Echoes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Echoes" title="">[6]</a></sup> by critics when it was released in November 1995. Knight went on to win two Black Music Awards in 1996 (&#34;Best R&#38;B Artist&#34; and &#34;Best Producer&#34; for 2B3) and was named Best R&#38;B Act by <i>Blues and Soul Magazine</i>, beating a host of American stars. However, the commercial success of the album failed to match its critical success and the album peaked on the UK album chart at number one-hundred-and-forty-five. Several singles were released from the project, the biggest being &#34;<a href="/wiki/Flavour_of_the_Old_School" id="w">Flavour of the Old School</a>&#34;, which peaked at number thirty-three in March 1996 when it was re-released. </p>
<p>In February 1997, Beverley left Dome Records after disagreements concerning her musical direction and instead signed a new four-album deal with <a href="/wiki/EMI" id="w">EMI</a> controlled <a href="/wiki/Parlophone" id="w">Parlophone</a> Records. After returning to the studio with 2B3 and Don E and teaming up with new producers Dodge and Carl McIntosh, Beverley released her second album <i><a href="/wiki/Prodigal_Sista" id="w">Prodigal Sista</a></i> in August 1998. Peaking at number forty-two in <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">Britain</a>, the commercial success of the album proved to be much greater than her debut. The album went on to sell 135,000 copies in Britain<sup id="_ref-MusicWeek_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MusicWeek" title="">[7]</a></sup> and be certified Gold in 1999.<sup id="_ref-BPI Prod Sista_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BPI Prod Sista" title="">[8]</a></sup> It contained five top forty hits – the biggest of which were &#34;<a href="/wiki/Greatest_Day" id="w">Greatest Day</a>&#34;, peaking at number fourteen, and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Made_It_Back#Made It Back 99" id="w">Made It Back 99</a>&#34; featuring US rap star <a href="/wiki/Redman_(rapper)" id="w">Redman</a>, which peaked at number nineteen.</p>
<p>The commercial success of <i>Prodigal Sista</i> marked a big step forward in Beverley’s career and was reflected in the widespread critical acclaim of the project. <i><a href="/wiki/Q_Magazine" id="w">Q Magazine</a></i> called the album &#34;a triumph not only of Knight’s musical vision but also of the strength in her character&#34; while <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" id="w">The Times</a></i> remarked &#34;<i>Prodigal Sista</i> is a joy to hear – her vocal and intricate self devised and performed harmonies can make you catch your breath in wonderment&#34;. Labelled as one of the greatest British soul albums of all time, the album won three <a href="/wiki/MOBO" id="w">MOBO</a> (Music Of Black Origin) Awards with &#34;Made It Back&#34; and &#34;Greatest Day&#34; winning Best R&#38;B Act in 1998 and 1999 respectively, and <i>Prodigal Sista</i> winning the Best Album Award.<sup id="_ref-MOBO_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MOBO" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="2001%26ndash%3B2005:_Mainstream_breakthrough" name="2001%26ndash%3B2005:_Mainstream_breakthrough"></a><h3>2001&#8211;2005: Mainstream breakthrough</h3>

<p>Throughout 2001 Beverley returned to the recording studio to write and record her third studio album. She was accompanied by a different array of writers and producers from Britain and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, which included <a href="/wiki/James_Poyser" id="w">James Poyser</a>, Derrick Joshua &#38; Derrick Martin, D’Influence, Mike Spencer and Colin Emmanuael. The result was <i><a href="/wiki/Who_I_Am_(Beverley_Knight_album)" id="w">Who I Am</a></i>, which was released in March 2002. It was preceded by two singles, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Get_Up!_(Beverley_Knight_song)" id="w">Get Up!</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Shoulda_Woulda_Coulda" id="w">Shoulda Woulda Coulda</a>&#34; which became Beverley’s most successful single up to that point, peaking at number ten on the UK singles chart. The success of the singles, together with wide critical praise, propelled the album to number seven on the album chart making <i><a href="/wiki/Who_I_Am_(Beverley_Knight_album)" id="w">Who I Am</a></i> Beverley’s most commercially successful album to date. It was re-released twice with new versions of the singles &#34;<a href="/wiki/Gold_(Beverley_Knight_song)" id="w">Gold</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Shape_Of_You_(Reshaped)" id="w">Shape Of You (Reshaped)</a>&#34; and has sold 215,000 copies in Britain,<sup id="_ref-MusicWeek_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MusicWeek" title="">[7]</a></sup> earning it a Gold sales certificate.<sup id="_ref-BPI Who I Am_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BPI Who I Am" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The critical response to <i><a href="/wiki/Who_I_Am_(Beverley_Knight_album)" id="w">Who I Am</a></i> was largely positive, with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" id="w">The Guardian</a></i> stating &#34;every song bubbles with the kind of expensive, polished confidence that often eludes British contenders, and she sings with the poise of an artist at the height of her powers&#34;<sup id="_ref-Guardian Who I Am_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Guardian Who I Am" title="">[11]</a></sup> whilst the <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a> remarked &#34;Who I Am marks a significant change in direction for this tenacious 28-year-old singer, signifying her own personal growth as a true artist and developing songwriter....on this her most personal work to date, she takes us on an intimate journey where she bares her soul with such raw honesty that you get the distinct impression a healing process is taking place&#34;.<sup id="_ref-BBC Review_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC Review" title="">[12]</a></sup> Although the album failed to match the widespread and unanimous acclaim of Beverley’s first two albums, it still earned her two <a href="/wiki/BRIT_Awards" id="w">BRIT Award</a> nominations (&#34;Best Female&#34;, &#34;Best Urban Act&#34;)<sup id="_ref-BRIT Noms_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRIT Noms" title="">[13]</a></sup> and the album was nominated for the prestigious <a href="/wiki/Mercury_Music_Prize" id="w">Mercury Music Prize</a> in 2002.<sup id="_ref-Mercury_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mercury" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>After touring Britain in 2002, Knight set about creating her fourth album and entered the studio in the summer of 2003. In an attempt to appeal to a larger mainstream audience, she enlisted the help of pop producers such as <a href="/wiki/Guy_Chambers" id="w">Guy Chambers</a> and Peter-John Vettese as well as collaborating with R&#38;B producers such as DJ Munro. The result was <i><a href="/wiki/Affirmation_(Beverley_Knight_album)" id="w">Affirmation</a></i>, which was released on <a href="/wiki/Parlophone" id="w">Parlophone</a> Records in June 2004. The album entered the charts at number eleven and was preceded by the single &#34;<a href="/wiki/Come_As_You_Are_(Beverley_Knight_song)" id="w">Come As You Are</a>&#34; – a rock/pop orientated song written with and produced by Chambers. The song marked a more mainstream pop sound that alienated Knight’s largely urban fan base and the song was not well received by urban radio stations. Nevertheless it became her biggest hit to date, peaking at number nine on the singles chart. The song was followed by two more singles, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Not_Too_Late_for_Love" id="w">Not Too Late for Love</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Keep_This_Fire_Burning" id="w">Keep This Fire Burning</a>&#34;, which helped boost album sales and resulted in the album being awarded a Gold sales certificate in December 2004.<sup id="_ref-BPI Affirmation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BPI Affirmation" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The themes running throughout the album, which were influenced by the events she had witnessed over the previous two years, marked a milestone in Knight’s career as a <a href="/wiki/Lyricist" id="w">lyricist</a>. The main essence of the project was centred on Beverley’s relationship with Tyrone Jamison – a gay man whom she described as her &#34;soul mate&#34; and who died of an <a href="/wiki/AIDS" id="w">AIDS</a> related disease in 2003. Throughout the album, lyrics on tracks such as &#34;Remember Me&#34; (&#34;One day we will be reunited, least I hope that is our destiny, so while you chill in the arms of angels, remember me, remember me&#34;) and &#34;No One Ever Loves In Vain&#34; clearly point to Beverley’s close relationship with Tyrone and rank as her most personal work to date.</p>
<p>Compared to the praise of her previous albums, the critical response to <i><a href="/wiki/Affirmation" id="w">Affirmation</a></i> was mixed. The mainstream press such as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" id="w">The Guardian</a></i> praised her for branching out, whilst the black music press such as <i>The Voice</i> and <i>Blues and Soul</i> accused Knight of selling out and being manipulated away from urban music by her record label, a claim she flatly denies: &#34;Everything I’ve done musically has been completely me. I write my own songs so I’m not just a vocalist who can easily be dictated to.&#34;<sup id="_ref-voice_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-voice" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="2006%26ndash%3Bpresent:_Consolidating_success" name="2006%26ndash%3Bpresent:_Consolidating_success"></a><h3>2006&#8211;present: Consolidating success</h3>
<p>In February 2006 Knight consolidated her move into the mainstream audience by appearing on BBC1 music show, <i><a href="/wiki/Just_The_Two_of_Us" id="w">Just The Two of Us</a></i>. The show, featuring celebrities who duet with established singers, ran for two weeks and proved to be a relative disappointment in terms of audience figures – averaging between fifteen and twenty-five percent audience shares.<sup id="_ref-tv ratings_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tv ratings" title="">[17]</a></sup> Nevertheless it provided a platform for Knight to reach out to a bigger audience and demonstrate her talent by performing a different array of songs than she would otherwise be known for.  Reaching out to new audiences was also a driving force behind Knight’s decision to join <a href="/wiki/Take_That" id="w">Take That</a> on their reunion arena tour. <i>Take That - The Ultimate Tour 06</i>, which ran from April to July 2006, sold 270,000 tickets in less than four hours on sale at the box office and featured Knight as a support act.<sup id="_ref-take that tour_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-take that tour" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>In March 2006 Beverley released her fifth album, a compilation set featuring the majority of her top forty UK singles entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Voice_-_The_Best_Of_Beverley_Knight" id="w">Voice - The Best Of Beverley Knight</a></i>. The album, which was certified Gold less than a month after its release,<sup id="_ref-BPI Voice_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BPI Voice" title="">[19]</a></sup> became her second highest charting of her career when it entered the UK albums chart at number ten and rose to number nine a month later. It was preceded by the single &#34;Piece of my Heart&#34; – a cover of the <a href="/wiki/Erma_Franklin" id="w">Erma Franklin</a> classic made famous by <a href="/wiki/Janis_Joplin" id="w">Janis Joplin</a> and entered the singles chart at number sixteen, spending eleven weeks inside the UK top 75 singles chart and becoming her longest-running chart single to date.</p>
<p>In October 2006, Knight recorded her fifth studio album, <i><a href="/wiki/Music_City_Soul" id="w">Music City Soul</a></i>, in <a href="/wiki/Nashville" id="w">Nashville</a>. Completed in less than five days, the album was released on <a href="/wiki/7_May" id="w">7 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> and features collaborations with musicians such as <a href="/wiki/Ronnie_Wood" id="w">Ronnie Wood</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scotty_Moore" id="w">Scotty Moore</a>. It has spawned three singles thus far, &#34;<a href="/wiki/No_Man%26%2339%3Bs_Land_(Beverley_Knight_song)" id="w">No Man&#39;s Land</a>&#34;, released on <a href="/wiki/16_April" id="w">16 April</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, &#34;<a href="/wiki/After_You_(song)" id="w">After You</a>&#34;, released on <a href="/wiki/2_July" id="w">2 July</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> and &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Queen_of_Starting_Over" id="w">The Queen of Starting Over</a>&#34;, released on <a href="/wiki/15_October" id="w">15 October</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.</p>
<a id="Creativity_%26_Influences" name="Creativity_%26_Influences"></a><h2>Creativity &#38; Influences</h2>

<p>Growing up in a <a href="/wiki/Pentecostal" id="w">Pentecostal</a> environment of Jamaican descent, music – especially <a href="/wiki/Gospel_music" id="w">gospel music</a> – became a staple part of Knight’s childhood. She entered the gospel choir of her local church at the age of just four years old and eventually became the musical director before she left in her late teens. Her musical education continued at home where her family would often sing together around the <a href="/wiki/Piano" id="w">piano</a> and listen to music from their favourite gospel and soul artists such as <a href="/wiki/Sam_Cooke" id="w">Sam Cooke</a>. In 2005, Knight revisited her childhood when she hosted <i>Beverley’s Gospel Nights</i>, a <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radio_2" id="w">BBC Radio 2</a> series exploring <a href="/wiki/Gospel_music" id="w">gospel music</a>. Featuring interviews with artists such as <a href="/wiki/Shirley_Caesar" id="w">Shirley Caesar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Percy_Sledge" id="w">Percy Sledge</a> and <a href="/wiki/Destiny%E2%80%99s_Child" id="w">Destiny’s Child</a> stars <a href="/wiki/Kelly_Rowland" id="w">Kelly Rowland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Michelle_Williams_(singer)" id="w">Michelle Williams</a>, the six-part series explored the roots of <a href="/wiki/Gospel_music" id="w">gospel music</a> and the impact it had upon the black community. Such was the success of the show that a second six-part series was commissioned and began in March 2006 and featured new interviews with artists such as <a href="/wiki/Candi_Staton" id="w">Candi Staton</a>, <a href="/wiki/David_McAlmont" id="w">David McAlmont</a> and Marvin Winans. Knight&#39;s interview technique and her ability to get her guests to open up and discuss issues in their personal lives such as <a href="/wiki/Domestic_violence" id="w">domestic violence</a> and <a href="/wiki/Clinical_depression" id="w">depression</a> received favourable reviews and led the <a href="/wiki/Radio_Times" id="w">Radio Times</a> to comment &#34;Knight&#39;s passion for the music is obvious - but so is her warmth, which makes her a rarity among interviewers.&#34;<sup id="_ref-radio times review_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-radio times review" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first artist to make an impact upon Knight was one of the true founders of contemporary <a href="/wiki/Gospel" id="w">gospel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" id="w">soul music</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sam_Cooke" id="w">Sam Cooke</a>. Despite his untimely death in 1963, his music endured and became a staple part of Knight&#39;s childhood:
{{cquote}}</p>
<p>Indeed the impact <a href="/wiki/Sam_Cooke" id="w">Sam Cooke</a> can be seen throughout Knight’s career as she has often performed and recorded Cooke classics, the most notable of which is &#34;<a href="/wiki/A_Change_Is_Gonna_Come_(song)" id="w">A Change Is Gonna Come</a>&#34;. The track, which came to exemplify the <a href="/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement" id="w">Civil Rights Movement</a> in the 1960s, has featured in many of Knight’s live performances (usually with the aid of the <a href="/wiki/London_Community_Gospel_Choir" id="w">London Community Gospel Choir</a>) and she even recorded a studio version with musician <a href="/wiki/Jools_Holland" id="w">Jools Holland</a>, which featured on his <i>Small World, Big Band Volume 2</i> album.</p>
<p>In addition to Cooke, another major presence in Knight’s childhood that has moulded her career is Lady Soul herself, <a href="/wiki/Aretha_Franklin" id="w">Aretha Franklin</a>. Besides leading a tribute to Franklin at the <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a>&#39;s <i>Music of the Millennium</i> concert in 1999 (which also featured <a href="/wiki/Spice_Girls" id="w">Spice Girl</a> <a href="/wiki/Melanie_B" id="w">Melanie B</a> and singer <a href="/wiki/Jocelyn_Brown" id="w">Jocelyn Brown</a>), Knight has recorded several of Franklin’s records, most notably &#34;Do Right Woman, Do Right Man&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Think_(Aretha_Franklin_song)" id="w">Think</a>&#34;, both of which have been released as <a href="/wiki/B-side" id="w">b-sides</a>. But it’s the Queen of Soul’s vocal delivery that has most had an impact upon Knight:
{{cquote}}
Heavily influenced by the likes of Franklin and Cooke, Knight has also recorded songs from of other legendary artists such as <a href="/wiki/Stevie_Wonder" id="w">Stevie Wonder</a> (&#34;Love&#39;s in Need of Love Today&#34;, which featured on the <a href="/wiki/Warchild" id="w">Warchild</a> album <i>Hope</i>) and <a href="/wiki/Curtis_Mayfield" id="w">Curtis Mayfield</a> (&#34;Hard Times&#34;, which appeared on <a href="/wiki/Courtney_Pine" id="w">Courtney Pine</a>’s <i>Back in the Day</i> album). But this influence has also manifested itself on stage where Knight often incorporates songs by her soul heroines such as <a href="/wiki/Nina_Simone" id="w">Nina Simone</a> (&#34;Feelin’ Good&#34;), <a href="/wiki/Chaka_Khan" id="w">Chaka Khan</a> (&#34;I Feel For You&#34; and &#34;Sweet Thing&#34;) and <a href="/wiki/Billie_Holliday" id="w">Billie Holliday</a> (&#34;God Bless the Child&#34;) into her live performances.</p>
<p>In addition to the pioneering soul and gospel artists of the mid-twentieth century, modern artists such as <a href="/wiki/Mary_J._Blige" id="w">Mary J. Blige</a> and <a href="/wiki/D%26%2339%3BAngelo" id="w">D&#39;Angelo</a> have also played a role in shaping Knight’s musical outlook. The most significant of her contemporary peers comes in the form of <a href="/wiki/Prince_(artist)" id="w">Prince</a>, a man she describes as one of her hero’s:  &#34;Prince goes back to me listening to preachers when I was a child, who tell a story to illustrate a point...the first song I heard by him was &#34;Little Red Corvette&#34;, when I was nine. Of course, I didn&#39;t have a clue about what he was singing about; the sexuality is implicit and I love that.&#34;<sup id="_ref-guardian influences_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardian influences" title="">[21]</a></sup> The influence of Prince, whom Knight even mentions on her <i><a href="/wiki/Prodigal_Sista" id="w">Prodigal Sista</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Who_I_Am_(Beverley_Knight_album)" id="w">Who I Am</a></i> album sleeves, can be seen throughout her back catalogue with songs such as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Get_Up!_(Beverley_Knight_song)" id="w">Get Up!</a>&#34;, &#34;Hurricane Jane&#34; and &#34;Supersonic&#34; being compared to Prince due to their mix of <a href="/wiki/Funk" id="w">funk</a> and soul.</p>
<p>Throughout her childhood, Knight’s musical exposure developed as she got older. Gospel led to soul, which led to <a href="/wiki/Funk" id="w">funk</a> which led to <a href="/wiki/R%26amp%3BB" id="w">R&#38;B</a><sup id="_ref-paul o'grady_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul o'grady" title="">[22]</a></sup> –  but growing up in the <a href="/wiki/Midlands" id="w">Midlands</a> meant that she was exposed to lots of other different influences too: &#34;It wasn’t a case that there was a huge black community who all stuck together and only listened to <a href="/wiki/Reggae" id="w">reggae</a> or <a href="/wiki/R%26amp%3BB" id="w">R&#38;B</a> or strictly black music. I find that <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> is a bit more segregated. In <a href="/wiki/Wolverhampton" id="w">Wolverhampton</a>, black people weren&#39;t so segregated and I think that had a massive impact on my musical influences.&#34;<sup id="_ref-voice_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-voice" title="">[16]</a></sup> This diversity is illustrated best by Knight’s forth studio album, <i><a href="/wiki/Affirmation_(Beverley_Knight_album)" id="w">Affirmation</a></i>. After working with <a href="/wiki/Guy_Chambers" id="w">Guy Chambers</a>, the album had a more mainstream flavour compared to her previous albums and was led by the rock guitar driven single &#34;<a href="/wiki/Come_As_You_Are_(Beverley_Knight_song)" id="w">Come As You Are</a>&#34;. Although the song became her highest charting single to date, Knight was largely criticised by urban radio and media for moving too far away from her urban sound. Nevertheless the song illustrated Knight’s determined effort not to become boxed in and &#34;ghettoised&#34;.</p>

<a id="Accolades" name="Accolades"></a><h3>Accolades</h3>
<p>In 2006 it was announced that Knight was to be awarded an <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" id="w">MBE</a> in acknowledgement for her services to music and the work she does on behalf of several charities. She was presented with the accolade by <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Elizabeth II</a> at a ceremony at <a href="/wiki/Buckingham_Palace" id="w">Buckingham Palace</a> in February 2007. After the ceremony Knight remarked that the recognition &#34;reflects not only on my whole career but the work I do for charities which is immensely important to me. I do not do that to be awarded for it, I just do it because it&#39;s in my heart, but to be recognised for it, hopefully will put the magnifying glass on to them as well&#34;.<sup id="_ref-mbe_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mbe" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>In September 2005 Knight was presented with an <a href="/wiki/Honorary_degree" id="w">honorary degree</a> from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Wolverhampton" id="w">University of Wolverhampton</a>. After being made a <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Music" id="w">Doctor of Music</a>, she stated: “I am proud to say I am Black, female and British but it is still all me, I have not forgotten my roots. I am enormously proud to be receiving this award, it is a great honour and also very humbling.”.<sup id="_ref-doc wolv_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-doc wolv" title="">[24]</a></sup> Professor Craig Mahoney from the University announced “we are delighted to bestow on Beverley the award of an honorary degree of doctor of music in recognition of her outstanding contribution to music and the local community, and in recognition of her extensive charity work.”<sup id="_ref-doctor of music awards_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-doctor of music awards" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
