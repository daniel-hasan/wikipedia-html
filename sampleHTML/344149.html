<p>&#34;<b>Ulysses</b>&#34; is a poem by the <a href="/wiki/Victorian_era" id="w">Victorian</a> poet <a href="/wiki/Alfred%2C_Lord_Tennyson" id="w">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a> (1809–92), written in 1833 and published in 1842 in Tennyson&#39;s well-received second volume of poems. An oft-quoted poem, it is popularly used to illustrate the <a href="/wiki/Dramatic_monologue" id="w">dramatic monologue</a> poetic form. In the poem, Ulysses describes, to an unspecified audience, his discontent and restlessness upon returning to his kingdom, <a href="/wiki/Ithaca" id="w">Ithaca</a>, after his far-ranging travels. Facing old age, Ulysses yearns to explore again, despite his reunion with his wife <a href="/wiki/Penelope" id="w">Penelope</a> and son <a href="/wiki/Telemachus" id="w">Telemachus</a>.</p>
<p>The character of Ulysses (Greek: <i><a href="/wiki/Odysseus" id="w">Odysseus</a></i>) has been explored widely in literature. The adventures of Odysseus were first recorded in <a href="/wiki/Homer" id="w">Homer&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Iliad" id="w">Iliad</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Odyssey" id="w">Odyssey</a></i> (c.&#160;800–600&#160;BC), and Tennyson draws on Homer&#39;s narrative in the poem; most critics, however, find that Tennyson&#39;s Ulysses recalls the character Ulisse in <a href="/wiki/Dante_Alighieri" id="w">Dante&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Divine_Comedy#Inferno" id="w">Inferno</a></i> (c.&#160;1320). In Dante&#39;s re-telling, Ulisse is condemned to hell among the false counsellors, both for his pursuit of knowledge beyond human bounds and for his adventures in disregard of his family.</p>
<p>For most of this poem&#39;s history, readers viewed Ulysses as resolute and heroic, admiring him for his determination &#34;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&#34;.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The view that Tennyson intended a heroic character is supported by his statements about the poem, and by the events in his life—the death of his closest friend—that prompted him to write it. In the twentieth century, scholars began to offer interpretations of &#34;Ulysses&#34; that highlight potential <a href="/wiki/Irony" id="w">ironies</a> in the poem. They argue, for example, that Ulysses wishes to selfishly abandon his kingdom and family, and they question Ulysses&#39; character by demonstrating how he resembles flawed protagonists in earlier literature.</p>

<p>As the poem begins, Ulysses has returned to his kingdom, <a href="/wiki/Ithaca" id="w">Ithaca</a>, having had a long, eventful journey home after fighting in the <a href="/wiki/Trojan_War" id="w">Trojan War</a>. Confronted again by domestic life, Ulysses expresses his lack of contentment, including his indifference toward the &#34;savage race&#34; (line 4) that he governs. Ulysses contrasts his restlessness and boredom with his heroic past. He contemplates his age and eventual death—&#34;Life piled on life / Were all too little, and of one to me / Little remains&#34;&#160;(24–26)—and longs for further experience and knowledge. His son <a href="/wiki/Telemachus" id="w">Telemachus</a> will inherit the throne that Ulysses finds burdensome. While Ulysses thinks Telemachus will be an adequate king, he seems to have little empathy for his son—&#34;He works his work, I mine&#34;&#160;(43)—and the necessary methods of governing—&#34;by slow prudence&#34;&#160;(36) and &#34;through soft degrees&#34;&#160;(37). In the final section, Ulysses turns his attention to his mariners and calls on them to join him on another quest, making no guarantees as to their fate but attempting to conjure their heroic past:</p>
<p>&#60;poem&#62;
                 … Come, my friends,
</p><dl><dd>&#39;Tis not too late to seek a newer world.</dd></dl><dl><dd>Push off, and sitting well in order smite</dd></dl><dl><dd>The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds</dd></dl><dl><dd>To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths</dd></dl><dl><dd>Of all the western stars, until I die.</dd></dl><dl><dd>It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:</dd></dl><dl><dd>It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,</dd></dl><dl><dd>And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. <small>(56–64)</small></dd></dl>
<p>&#60;/poem&#62;</p>
<p>The poem&#39;s seventy lines of <a href="/wiki/Blank_verse" id="w">blank verse</a> are presented as a <a href="/wiki/Dramatic_monologue" id="w">dramatic monologue</a>. There is often a marked contrast between the sentiment of Ulysses&#39; words and the sounds that express them.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The speaker seems to choose his tone carefully to reinforce his sophistication and rank.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> His language is unadorned and forceful—sometimes &#34;forced&#34;, according to <a href="/wiki/T._S._Eliot" id="w">T. S. Eliot</a><sup id="_ref-eliot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eliot" title="">[4]</a></sup>—and it expresses Ulysses&#39; conflicting moods as he searches for continuity between his past and future. The poem&#39;s insistent <a href="/wiki/Iambic_pentameter" id="w">iambic pentameter</a> is often interrupted by <a href="/wiki/Spondee" id="w">spondees</a> (<a href="/wiki/Metrical_feet" id="w">metrical feet</a> consisting of two long syllables), which slow down the movement of the poem. Noteworthy are lines 19–21:</p>
<p>&#60;poem&#62;
</p><dl><dd>Yet all experience is an arch wherethro&#39;</dd></dl><dl><dd>Gleams that untravell&#39;d world, whose margin fades</dd></dl><dl><dd>For ever and for ever when I move. <small>(19–21)</small></dd></dl>
<p>&#60;/poem&#62;</p>
<p>Observing their burdensome <a href="/wiki/Prosodic" id="w">prosodic</a> effect, the poet <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Arnold" id="w">Matthew Arnold</a> remarked, &#34;these three lines by themselves take up nearly as much time as a whole book of the <i>Iliad</i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>
Many of the poem&#39;s clauses carry over into the following line; this <a href="/wiki/Enjambment" id="w">enjambment</a> emphasizes Ulysses&#39; restlessness and dissatisfaction.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Tennyson completed the poem on <a href="/wiki/October_20" id="w">October 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1833" id="w">1833</a>,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> but it was not published until 1842, in his second collection of <i>Poems</i>. Unlike many of Tennyson&#39;s other important poems, &#34;Ulysses&#34; was not revised after its publication.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Tennyson originally blocked out the poem in four paragraphs; it has, however, been printed with both three and four paragraphs, structures that affect the analysis of Ulysses&#39; narration. With three paragraphs, the poem is divided at lines 33 and 44; with four, the five-line introduction becomes its own movement. In this four-movement version, the first and third are thematically parallel, but may be read as interior and exterior <a href="/wiki/Monologue" id="w">monologues</a>, respectively.<sup id="_ref-p41_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p41" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Scholars disagree about how &#34;Ulysses&#34; functions as a dramatic monologue; it is not necessarily clear to whom Ulysses is speaking, if anyone, and from what location. Some see the verse turning from a <a href="/wiki/Soliloquy" id="w">soliloquy</a> to a public address, as Ulysses seems to speak to himself in the first movement, then to turn to an audience as he introduces his son, and then to relocate to the seashore where he addresses his mariners.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> In this interpretation, the comparatively direct and honest language of the first movement is set against the more politically minded tone of the last two movements. For example, the second paragraph&#160;(33–43) about Telemachus, in which Ulysses muses again about domestic life, is a &#34;revised version [of lines 1–5] for public consumption&#34;:<sup id="_ref-p41_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p41" title="">[9]</a></sup> a &#34;savage race&#34; is revised to a &#34;rugged race&#34;.</p>
<p>The ironic interpretations of &#34;Ulysses&#34; may be the result of the modern tendency to consider the narrator of a dramatic monologue as necessarily &#34;<a href="/wiki/Unreliable_narrator" id="w">unreliable</a>&#34;. According to critic Dwight Culler, the poem has been a victim of revisionist readings in which the reader expects to reconstruct the truth from a misleading narrator&#39;s accidental revelations.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Culler himself views &#34;Ulysses&#34; as a <a href="/wiki/Dialectic" id="w">dialectic</a> in which the speaker weighs the virtues of a contemplative and an active approach to life;<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Ulysses moves through four emotional stages that are self-revelatory, not ironic: beginning with his rejection of the barren life to which he has returned in Ithaca, he then fondly recalls his heroic past, recognizes the validity of Telemachus&#39; method of governing, and with these thoughts plans another journey.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

</p><a id="Autobiographical_elements" name="Autobiographical_elements"></a><h3>Autobiographical elements</h3>

<p>Tennyson penned &#34;Ulysses&#34; after the death of his close <a href="/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" id="w">Cambridge</a> friend, the poet <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Henry_Hallam" id="w">Arthur Henry Hallam</a> (1811–33), with whom Tennyson had a strong emotional bond. The two friends had spent much time discussing poetry and philosophy, writing verse, and travelling in <a href="/wiki/Southern_France" id="w">southern France</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Pyrenees" id="w">Pyrenees</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>. Tennyson considered Hallam destined for greatness, perhaps as a statesman.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> </p>
<p>When Tennyson heard on <a href="/wiki/October_1" id="w">October 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1833" id="w">1833</a> of his friend&#39;s death, he was living in <a href="/wiki/Somersby%2C_Lincolnshire" id="w">Somersby</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lincolnshire" id="w">Lincolnshire</a>, in cramped quarters with his mother and nine of his ten siblings. His father had died in 1831, requiring Tennyson to return home and take responsibility for the family. Tennyson&#39;s friends were becoming increasingly concerned about his mental and physical health during this time. The family had little income, and two of Tennyson&#39;s brothers were mentally ill. Just as Tennyson&#39;s outlook was improving—he was adjusting to his new domestic duties, regaining contact with friends, and had published his 1832 book of poems—the news of Hallam&#39;s death arrived. Tennyson shared his grief with his sister, <a href="/wiki/Emilia_Tennyson" id="w">Emily</a>, who had been engaged to Hallam.</p>
<p>According to Victorian scholar Linda Hughes, the emotional gulf between the state of his domestic affairs and the loss of his special friendship informs the reading of &#34;Ulysses&#34;—particularly its treatment of domesticity.<sup id="_ref-hughes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hughes" title="">[15]</a></sup> At one moment, Ulysses&#39; discontent seems to mirror that of Tennyson, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief. At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by travelling again. It may be that Ulysses&#39; determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth;<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> he said that the poem &#34;gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life&#34;.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> On another occasion, the poet stated, &#34;There is more about myself in <i>Ulysses</i>, which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by, but that still life must be fought out to the end. It was more written with the feeling of [Hallam&#39;s] loss upon me than many poems in <i>In Memoriam</i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> Hallam&#39;s death influenced much of Tennyson&#39;s poetry, including perhaps his most highly regarded work, <i><a href="/wiki/In_Memoriam_A.H.H." id="w">In Memoriam A.H.H.</a></i>, begun in 1833 and completed seventeen years later.</p>
<p>Other critics find stylistic incongruities between the poem and its author that make &#34;Ulysses&#34; exceptional. W. W. Robson writes, &#34;Tennyson, the responsible social being, the admirably serious and &#39;committed&#39; individual, is uttering strenuous sentiments in the accent of Tennyson the most un-strenuous, lonely and poignant of poets.&#34;<sup id="_ref-robson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-robson" title="">[19]</a></sup> He finds that Tennyson&#39;s two widely noted personae, the &#34;responsible social being&#34; and the melancholic poet, meet uniquely in &#34;Ulysses&#34;, yet seem not to recognize each other within the text.</p>

<a id="Literary_context" name="Literary_context"></a><h3>Literary context</h3>

<p>Tennyson adopts aspects of the Ulysses character and narrative from many sources.<sup id="_ref-Stanford202_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stanford202" title="">[21]</a></sup> His treatment of Ulysses is the first modern account<sup id="_ref-Stanford202_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stanford202" title="">[21]</a></sup>—before him, the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" id="w">ancient Greek</a> poet <a href="/wiki/Homer" id="w">Homer</a> introduced Ulysses (<a href="/wiki/Odysseus" id="w">Odysseus</a> in Greek<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>), and many later poets took up the character, including <a href="/wiki/Euripides" id="w">Euripides</a>, <a href="/wiki/Horace" id="w">Horace</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dante" id="w">Dante</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" id="w">William Shakespeare</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Pope" id="w">Alexander Pope</a>.  Homer&#39;s <i>Odyssey</i> provides the poem&#39;s narrative background: in its eleventh book the prophet <a href="/wiki/Tiresias" id="w">Tiresias</a> foretells that Ulysses will return to Ithaca after a difficult voyage, then begin a new, mysterious voyage, and finally die an &#34;unwarlike&#34; death at sea. By Tennyson&#39;s poem&#39;s end, his Ulysses is contemplating undertaking this new voyage.</p>
<p>Tennyson&#39;s character, however, is not the lover of public affairs seen in Homer&#39;s poems. Rather, some critics see &#34;Ulisse&#34; from <a href="/wiki/Dante" id="w">Dante&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Divine_Comedy#Inferno" id="w">Inferno</a></i> as Tennyson&#39;s main source for the character,<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> which has an important effect on the poem&#39;s interpretation.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Ulisse recalls his voyage in the <i>Inferno<b>s 26th <a href="/wiki/Canto" id="w">canto</a>, in which he is condemned to the Eighth Circle of false counsellors for misusing his gift of reason. Dante treats Ulisse, with his &#34;zeal&#160;…/ T&#39;explore the world&#34;, as an evil counselor who lusts for adventure at the expense of his family and his duties in Ithaca.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Some consider that Tennyson projects this zeal into Ulysses&#39; unquenched desire for knowledge:<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> </b></i></p>
<p>&#60;poem&#62;
</p><dl><dd>And this gray spirit yearning in desire</dd></dl><dl><dd>To follow knowledge like a sinking star,</dd></dl><dl><dd>Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. <small>(30–32)</small></dd></dl>
<p>&#60;/poem&#62;</p>
<p>The poet&#39;s intention to recall the Homeric character remains evident in certain passages. &#34;I am become a name&#34;&#160;(11) recalls an episode in the <i>Odyssey</i> in which <a href="/wiki/Demodocus_(Homer)" id="w">Demodocus</a> sings about Odysseus&#39; adventures in the king&#39;s presence, acknowledging his fame. With phrases such as &#34;There gloom the dark broad seas&#34;&#160;(45) and &#34;The deep / Moans round with many voices&#34;&#160;(55–56), Tennyson seems to be consciously invoking Homer.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critics have also noted the influence of Shakespeare in two passages. In the early movement, the savage race &#34;That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me&#34;&#160;(5) echoes <a href="/wiki/Prince_Hamlet" id="w">Hamlet&#39;s</a> <a href="/wiki/Soliloquy" id="w">soliloquy</a>: &#34;What is a man, / If his chief good and market of his time / Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.&#34;<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Tennyson&#39;s &#34;How dull it is to pause, to make an end, / To rust unburnish’d, not to shine in use!&#34;&#160;(22–23) recalls Shakespeare&#39;s Ulysses in <i><a href="/wiki/Troilus_and_Cressida" id="w">Troilus and Cressida</a></i> (c. 1602):<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>
&#60;poem&#62;
</p><dl><dd>Perserverance, my dear lord,</dd></dl><dl><dd>Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang</dd></dl><dl><dd>Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail,</dd></dl><dl><dd>In monumental mockery.</dd></dl>
<p>&#60;/poem&#62;</p>
<p>The last movement of &#34;Ulysses&#34;, which is among the most familiar passages in nineteenth-century English-language poetry, presents decisive evidence of the influence of Dante.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup>  Ulysses turns his attention from himself and his kingdom and speaks of ports, seas, and his mariners. The strains of discontent and weakness in old age remain throughout the poem, but Tennyson finally leaves Ulysses &#34;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&#34;&#160;(70), recalling the Dantesque damnable desire for knowledge beyond all bounds. The words of Dante&#39;s character as he exhorts his men to the journey find parallel in those of Tennyson&#39;s Ulysses, who calls his men to join him on one last voyage. Quoting Dante&#39;s Ulisse:</p>
<p>&#60;poem&#62;
</p><dl><dd>&#39;O brothers&#39;, said I, &#39;who are come despite</dd></dl><dl><dd>Ten thousand perils to the West, let none,</dd></dl><dl><dd>While still our senses hold the vigil slight</dd></dl><dl><dd>Remaining to us ere our course is run,</dd></dl><dl><dd>Be willing to forgo experience</dd></dl><dl><dd>Of the unpeopled world beyond the sun.</dd></dl><dl><dd>Regard your origin,—from whom and whence!</dd></dl><dl><dd>Not to exist like brutes, but made were ye</dd></dl><dl><dd>To follow virtue and intelligence&#39;.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>&#60;/poem&#62;</p>
<p>However, critics note that in the Homeric narrative, Ulysses&#39; original mariners are dead. A significant irony therefore develops from Ulysses&#39; speech to his sailors—&#34;Come, my friends, / &#39;Tis not too late to seek a newer world&#34;&#160;(56–57). Since Dante&#39;s Ulisse has already undertaken this voyage and recounts it in the <i>Inferno</i>, Ulysses&#39; entire monologue can be envisioned as his recollection while situated in Hell.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The interplay of <a href="/wiki/Narrative" id="w">narratives</a> among the works involving Ulysses has been examined by a number of writers. The modern Tennyson critic Matthew Rowlinson considers &#34;Ulysses&#34; an argument for the continuation of a narrative in a textual tradition,<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> and  a &#34;meditation on the ground of that continuity&#34;.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> The narrator of the poem speaks in the fictional time of Homer&#39;s Ulysses, but his claims also belong to Tennyson&#39;s text, which exists in another temporal order. In Tennyson&#39;s poem, Ulysses asserts the inseparability of his person and his name: &#34;I am become a name&#160;… I am a part of all that I have met&#34;&#160;(11,&#160;18). In doing so, the narrator seems to refer to Ulysses&#39; fame <i>extending from</i> the many literary works about him.</p>

</p><a id="Ulysses_as_narrator" name="Ulysses_as_narrator"></a><h3>Ulysses as narrator</h3>

<p>The degree to which Tennyson identifies with Ulysses has provided one of the great debates among scholars of the poem.<sup id="_ref-hughes_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hughes" title="">[15]</a></sup> Critics who find that Tennyson identifies with the speaker read Ulysses&#39; speech &#34;affirmatively&#34;, or without <a href="/wiki/Irony" id="w">irony</a>. Many other interpretations of the poem have developed from the argument that Tennyson does not identify with Ulysses, and further criticism  has suggested that the purported inconsistencies in Ulysses&#39; character are the fault of the poet himself.</p>
<p>Key to the affirmative reading of &#34;Ulysses&#34; is the biographical context of the poem.  Such a reading takes into account Tennyson&#39;s statements about writing the poem—&#34;the need of going forward&#34;—and considers that he would not undermine Ulysses&#39; determination with irony when he needed a similar stalwartness to face life after Hallam&#39;s death. Ulysses is thus seen as an heroic character whose determination to seek &#34;some work of noble note&#34;&#160;(52) is courageous in the face of a &#34;still hearth&#34;&#160;(2) and old age.<sup id="_ref-hughes194_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hughes194" title="">[35]</a></sup> Tennyson, however, discouraged an autobiographical interpretation of his monologues.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Until the early twentieth century, readers reacted to &#34;Ulysses&#34; sympathetically. The meaning of the poem was increasingly debated as Tennyson&#39;s stature rose. After  Paull F. Baum criticized Ulysses&#39; inconsistencies and Tennyson&#39;s conception of the poem in 1948,<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> the ironic interpretation became dominant.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> Baum finds in Ulysses echoes of <a href="/wiki/Byronic_hero" id="w">Lord Byron&#39;s flawed heroes</a>, who similarly display conflicting emotions, self-critical introspection, and a rejection of social responsibility. Even Ulysses&#39; resolute final utterance—&#34;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&#34;—is undercut by irony, when Baum and later critics compare this line to <a href="/wiki/Satan" id="w">Satan&#39;s</a> &#34;courage never to submit or yield&#34; in <a href="/wiki/John_Milton" id="w">John Milton&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Paradise_Lost" id="w">Paradise Lost</a></i> (1667).<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Ulysses&#39; apparent disdain for those around him is another facet of the ironic perspective. He declares that he is &#34;matched with an aged wife&#34;&#160;(3), indicates his weariness in governing a &#34;savage race&#34;&#160;(4), and suggests his philosophical distance from his son Telemachus. A sceptical reading of the second paragraph finds it a condescending tribute to Telemachus and a rejection of his &#34;slow prudence&#34; (36). However, the adjectives used to describe Telemachus—&#34;blameless&#34;, &#34;discerning&#34;, and &#34;decent&#34;—are words with positive connotations in other of Tennyson&#39;s poetry and within the classical tradition,<sup id="_ref-hughes194_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hughes194" title="">[35]</a></sup> where &#34;blameless&#34; is an attribute of gods and heroes. </p>
<p>Critic E. J. Chiasson argued in 1954 that Ulysses is without faith in an afterlife, and that Tennyson uses a &#34;method of indirection&#34; to affirm the need for religious faith by showing how Ulysses&#39; lack of faith leads to his neglect of kingdom and family. Chiasson regards the poem as &#34;intractable&#34; in Tennyson&#39;s canon, but finds the poem&#39;s meaning resolves itself when this indirection is understood: it illustrates Tennyson&#39;s conviction that &#34;disregarding religious sanctions and &#39;submitting all things to desire&#39; leads to either a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sybaritic">sybaritic</a> or a brutal repudiation of responsibility and &#39;life&#39;.&#34;<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other ironic readings have found Ulysses longing for withdrawal, even death, in the form of his proposed quest.  In noting the sense of passivity in the poem, critics highlight Tennyson&#39;s tendency toward the melancholic. <a href="/wiki/T._S._Eliot" id="w">T. S. Eliot</a> opines that &#34;Tennyson could not tell a story at all&#34;.<sup id="_ref-eliot_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eliot" title="">[4]</a></sup> He finds Dante&#39;s treatment of Ulysses exciting, while Tennyson&#39;s piece is &#34;an elegiac mood&#34;.<sup id="_ref-eliot_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eliot" title="">[4]</a></sup> &#34;Ulysses&#34; is found lacking in  narrative action; the hero&#39;s goal is vague, and by the poem&#39;s famous last line, it is not clear for what he is &#34;striving&#34;, or to what he refuses to yield. According to Victorian scholar Herbert Tucker, Tennyson’s characters &#34;move&#34; through time and space to be moved inwardly.<sup id="_ref-tucker11_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tucker11" title="">[42]</a></sup>

<a id="Canonization" name="Canonization"></a><h3>Canonization</h3>

<p>The contemporary reviews of &#34;Ulysses&#34; were positive and found no irony in the poem. Author <a href="/wiki/John_Sterling_(author)" id="w">John Sterling</a>&#8212;like Tennyson a member of the <a href="/wiki/Cambridge_Apostles" id="w">Cambridge Apostles</a>&#8212;wrote in the <i><a href="/wiki/Quarterly_Review" id="w">Quarterly Review</a></i> in 1842, &#34;How superior is &#39;Ulysses&#39;! There is in this work a delightful epic tone, and a clear impassioned wisdom quietly carving its sage words and graceful figures on pale but lasting marble.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MarkleyQ124_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MarkleyQ124" title="">[43]</a></sup> Tennyson&#39;s 1842 volume of poetry impressed Scottish writer <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Carlyle" id="w">Thomas Carlyle</a>. Quoting three lines of &#34;Ulysses&#34; in an 1842 letter to Tennyson—</p>
<p>&#60;poem&#62;
</p><dl><dd>It may be that the gulfs will wash us down,</dd></dl><dl><dd>It may be we shall touch the happy Isles</dd></dl><dl><dd>And see the great Achilles whom we knew! [sic] <small>(62–64)</small></dd></dl>
<p>&#60;/poem&#62;</p>
<p>—Carlyle remarked, &#34;These lines do not make me weep, but there is in me what would fill whole Lachrymatories as I read.&#34;<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> English writer and theologian <a href="/wiki/Richard_Holt_Hutton" id="w">Richard Holt Hutton</a> summarized the poem as &#34;[Tennyson&#39;s] friendly picture of the insatiable craving for new experience, enterprise, and adventure, when under the control of a luminous reason and a self-controlled will.&#34;<sup id="_ref-qstorch_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-qstorch" title="">[45]</a></sup> The contemporary poet <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Arnold" id="w">Matthew Arnold</a> was early in observing the narrative irony of the poem: he found Ulysses&#39; speech &#34;the least <i>plain</i>, the most <i>un-Homeric</i>, which can possibly be conceived. Homer presents his thought to you just as it wells from the source of his mind: Mr. Tennyson carefully distils his thought before he will part with it. Hence comes&#160;… a heightened and elaborate air.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MarkleyQ124_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MarkleyQ124" title="">[43]</a></sup> </p>
<p>&#34;Ulysses&#34; was well-received by critics, yet its rise within the Tennyson canon took decades. Tennyson did not usually select it for publication in poetry anthologies; in teaching anthologies, however, the poem was usually included&#8212;and it remains a popular teaching poem today. Its current prominence in Tennyson&#39;s <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Oeuvre">oeuvre</a></i> is the result of two trends, according to Matthew Rowlinson: the rise of formal English poetry studies in the late nineteenth century, and the <a href="/wiki/Victorian_era" id="w">Victorian</a> effort to articulate a British culture that could be exported.<sup id="_ref-r1992_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-r1992" title="">[46]</a></sup> He argues that &#34;Ulysses&#34; forms part of the prehistory of <a href="/wiki/Imperialism" id="w">imperialism</a>—a term that only appeared in the language in 1851. The protagonist sounds like a &#34;colonial administrator&#34;, and his reference to seeking a newer world&#160;(57) echoes the phrase &#34;<a href="/wiki/New_World" id="w">New World</a>&#34;, which became common during the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" id="w">Renaissance</a>.  While &#34;Ulysses&#34; cannot be read as overtly imperialistic, Tennyson&#39;s later work as <a href="/wiki/Poet_Laureate" id="w">Poet Laureate</a> sometimes argues for the value of Britain&#39;s colonies, or was accused of <a href="/wiki/Jingoism" id="w">jingoism</a>. Rowlinson invokes the <a href="/wiki/Marxism" id="w">Marxist</a> theorist <a href="/wiki/Louis_Althusser" id="w">Louis Althusser&#39;s</a> extension of the argument that ideology is ahistorical, finding that Tennyson&#39;s poem &#34;comes before an ideological construction for which it nonetheless makes people nostalgic&#34;.<sup id="_ref-r1992_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-r1992" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#34;Ulysses&#34; remains much admired, even as the twentieth century brought new interpretations of the poem—scholars became sceptical of the narratorial voice and explored meanings beyond the <a href="/wiki/Authorial_intentionality" id="w">author&#39;s intention</a>.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> In a 1929 essay, <a href="/wiki/T._S._Eliot" id="w">T. S. Eliot</a> called &#34;Ulysses&#34; a &#34;perfect poem&#34;.<sup id="_ref-eliot2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eliot2" title="">[48]</a></sup> An analogue of Ulysses is found in Eliot&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/Gerontion" id="w">Gerontion</a>&#34; (1920). Both poems are narrated by an aged man contemplating life&#39;s end. An excerpt from &#34;Gerontion&#34; reads as an ironic comment on the introductory lines of &#34;Ulysses&#34;:<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> </p>
<p>&#60;poem&#62;
    Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.
    The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,
    Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.</p>
<pre>                I am an old man,	 
    A dull head among windy places. <small>(13–17)</small></pre>
<p>&#60;/poem&#62; </p>
<p>The Italian poet <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Pascoli" id="w">Giovanni Pascoli</a> (1855–1912) stated that his long lyric poem <i>L&#39;ultimo viaggio</i> was an attempt to reconcile the portrayals of Ulysses in Dante and Tennyson with the classical prophecy that Ulysses would die &#34;a mild death off the sea&#34;.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> Pascoli&#39;s Ulysses leaves Ithaca to retrace his epic voyage rather than begin another.</p>
<p>Professor of literature <a href="/wiki/Basil_Willey" id="w">Basil Willey</a> commented in 1956, &#34;In &#39;Ulysses&#39; the sense that he must press on and not moulder in idleness is expressed objectively, through the classical story, and not subjectively as his own experience. [Tennyson] comes here as near perfection in the grand manner as he ever did; the poem is flawless in tone from beginning to end; spare, grave, free from excessive decoration, and full of firmly controlled feeling.&#34;<sup id="_ref-qstorch_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-qstorch" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another measure of canonization is inclusion in <i><a href="/wiki/Bartlett%26%2339%3Bs_Familiar_Quotations" id="w">Bartlett&#39;s Familiar Quotations</a></i>:  as of the fifteenth edition (1980), nine separate sections of &#34;Ulysses&#34;, comprising 36 of the poem&#39;s 70 lines, are quoted,<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> compared to but six in the ninth edition (1891).</p>

<p>Many readers have accepted the acclaimed last lines of &#34;Ulysses&#34; as inspirational, despite the ironic interpretations that find Ulysses&#39; character inconsistent.
