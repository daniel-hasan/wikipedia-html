<p>A native of <a href="/wiki/Cork_(city)" id="w">Cork</a>, Murphy began his performing career as a <a href="/wiki/Rock_musician" id="w">rock musician</a>. After turning down a record deal, he made his professional acting debut in the play <i>Disco Pigs</i> in 1996. He went on to star in Irish and <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">UK</a> film and stage productions throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, first coming to international attention in 2003 as the hero in the <a href="/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction" id="w">post-apocalyptic</a> film <i><a href="/wiki/28_Days_Later" id="w">28 Days Later</a></i>. Murphy&#39;s best-known roles are as villains in two 2005 blockbusters: the <a href="/wiki/Scarecrow_(comics)" id="w">Scarecrow</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Superhero_film" id="w">superhero film</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_Begins" id="w">Batman Begins</a></i>, and Jackson Rippner in the <a href="/wiki/Thriller_(genre)" id="w">thriller</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Red_Eye_(film)" id="w">Red Eye</a></i>.

<p>In his late teens and early twenties, Murphy worked toward a career as a rock musician, playing guitar in several bands alongside his brother Pádraig.<sup id="_ref-RTE Guide 2004_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RTE Guide 2004" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-TONY 2005_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TONY 2005" title="">[16]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles" id="w">Beatles</a>-obsessed pair named their most successful band The Sons of Mr. Greengenes, after a <a href="/wiki/Hot_Rats" id="w">1969 song</a> by another idol, <a href="/wiki/Frank_Zappa" id="w">Frank Zappa</a>. Murphy sang and played guitar in the band, which he has said &#34;specialised in wacky lyrics and endless guitar solos.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Observer O'Hagan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Observer O'Hagan" title="">[17]</a></sup> In 1996,<sup id="_ref-From Cork to Gotham_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-From Cork to Gotham" title="">[15]</a></sup> The Sons of Mr. Greengenes were offered a five-album record deal by <a href="/wiki/Acid_Jazz_Records" id="w">Acid Jazz Records</a>,<sup id="_ref-Observer O'Hagan_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Observer O'Hagan" title="">[17]</a></sup> but they did not sign the contract.

<p>Also in 1996, Murphy began studying <a href="/wiki/Law" id="w">law</a> at <a href="/wiki/University_College_Cork" id="w">University College Cork</a> (UCC), but he failed his first year exams because, as he put it, he had &#34;no ambitions to do it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-From Cork to Gotham_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-From Cork to Gotham" title="">[15]</a></sup> Not only was he busy with his band,<sup id="_ref-RTE Guide 2004_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RTE Guide 2004" title="">[14]</a></sup> but he has admitted that he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was the wrong fit for his artistic personality.<sup id="_ref-Electric Mail_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Electric Mail" title="">[13]</a></sup> Furthermore, after seeing Corcadorca&#39;s stage production of <i><a href="/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange" id="w">A Clockwork Orange</a></i>, directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest.<sup id="_ref-From Cork to Gotham_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-From Cork to Gotham" title="">[15]</a></sup> His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society&#39;s amateur production of <i><a href="/wiki/Observe_the_Sons_of_Ulster_Marching_Towards_the_Somme" id="w">Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme</a></i>, but, according to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an acting career.<sup id="_ref-RTE Guide 2004_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RTE Guide 2004" title="">[14]</a></sup> Nonetheless, he began to transition away from working as a rock musician, about which he later remarked, &#34;I think there&#39;s such a thing as a performance gene. If it&#39;s in your DNA it needs to come out. For me it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there.

Because the film was set in Cork, Murphy was given a chance at the role of Damien O&#39;Donovan, a young doctor turned revolutionary, but he had to audition six times before winning the part. Murphy&#39;s family goes back in Cork for many generations; during the time period in which <i>The Wind That Shakes the Barley</i> is set, his grandfather was shot at by British soldiers for playing Irish music.<sup id="_ref-LAT pale blue eyes_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LAT pale blue eyes" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critic Denby described Murphy&#39;s approach to the part of Damien: &#34;Murphy is normally very quiet in movies; he has attained his mystique as an actor by staring at people with baby-blue eyes. In this film, too, he has, at times, a deep stillness, but he has idiosyncratic moments as well, such as when Damien has to execute a teen-ager who has ratted on the I.R.A. Murphy, writhing, shoots the boy and stumbles away, nausea struggling against duty.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Denby Barley_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Denby Barley" title="">[4]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Turan" id="w">Kenneth Turan</a> of the <i><a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" id="w">Los Angeles Times</a></i> wrote, &#34;Murphy is especially good at playing the zealotry as well as the soul-searching and the regret, at showing us a man who is eaten up alive because he&#39;s forced to act in ways that are contrary to his background and his training.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Turan on Barley_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turan on Barley" title="">[47]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Scotland_on_Sunday" id="w">Scotland on Sunday</a></i> commented, &#34;Cillian Murphy ... exudes a doe-eyed sensitivity that is central to our emotional involvement in the character&#39;s development. He is not a macho figure itching for a fight, but a man of peace, reluctantly drawn to the use of force. When he makes a commitment to Irish independence, it is unyielding and entirely believable.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Scotland on Barley_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Scotland on Barley" title="">[48]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/GQ_(magazine)" id="w">GQ UK</a></i> presented Murphy with their 2006 Actor of the Year award for his work in <i>The Wind That Shakes the Barley</i>.<sup id="_ref-BBC GQ 2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC GQ 2006" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
