<b>The collapse of the World Trade Center</b> was the central event of the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks" id="w">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>. The  two main towers of the <a href="/wiki/World_Trade_Center" id="w">World Trade Center</a> (WTC) complex were each hit by aircraft. The south tower (2 WTC) collapsed at 9:59 a.m., less than an hour after being hit, and the north tower (1 WTC) followed at 10:28 a.m. </p>
<p>2,750 people inside and near the towers were killed, including all 157 passengers and crew aboard the two airplanes.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The collapse of the twin towers also caused extensive damage to the rest of the complex and nearby buildings. As a result, at 5:20 p.m. <a href="/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center" id="w">7 World Trade Center</a> collapsed as well.<sup id="_ref-NIST2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIST2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency" id="w">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) completed its performance study of the buildings in May 2002. It declared the WTC design sound and attributed the collapses wholly to extraordinary factors beyond the control of the builders. While it called for further study, it suggested that the collapses were probably initiated by weakening of the floor joists. When the floors detached from the main structure of the building and fell onto each other, said FEMA, a progressive &#34;pancake&#34; collapse began.<sup id="_ref-FEMA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FEMA" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>FEMA&#39;s proposed explanation was rejected by a subsequent and much more detailed investigation by the <a href="/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology" id="w">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST), completed in September 2005. Like FEMA, NIST vindicated the design of the WTC, noting that the severity of the attacks and the magnitude of the destruction was beyond anything experienced in <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">U.S.</a> cities in the past. But NIST did not attribute the collapses to failing floor joists. On the contrary, NIST found that sagging floors pulled the outer walls of the buildings inwards until they buckled.<sup id="_ref-NIST_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIST" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The clean-up of the site involved round-the-clock operations, many contractors and sub-contractors, and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The demolition of the surrounding damaged buildings is still going on, even as new construction proceeds on the World Trade Center&#39;s replacement, the <a href="/wiki/Freedom_Tower" id="w">Freedom Tower</a>. Of the destroyed buildings, only <a href="/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center" id="w">7 World Trade Center</a> has so far been replaced.</p> 
<a id="Design_issues" name="Design_issues"></a><h2>Design issues</h2>
<p>{{main}}
The towers were designed as framed tube structures, which provided tenants with open floor plans, uninterrupted by columns or walls.  This was accomplished using numerous, closely-spaced perimeter columns to provide much of the strength to the structure, along with gravity load shared with the core columns.  Above the seventh floor there were 59 perimeter columns along each face of the building and there were 47 heavier columns in the core.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  All of the elevators and stairwells were located in the core, leaving a large column-free space between the perimeter that was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses.<sup id="_ref-NIST-chapter1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIST-chapter1" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The floors consisted of 4&#160;inch (10&#160;cm) thick lightweight <a href="/wiki/Concrete" id="w">concrete</a> slabs laid on a fluted steel deck.  A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the floors.  The trusses had a span of 60&#160;feet (18.2&#160;m) in the long-span areas and 35&#160;feet (11&#160;m) in the short span area.<sup id="_ref-NIST-chapter1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIST-chapter1" title="">[6]</a></sup>  The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns, and were therefore on 6&#160;foot 8&#160;inch (2.03&#160;m) centers.  The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the exterior side and a channel welded to the core columns on the interior side.  The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with <a href="/wiki/Viscoelasticity" id="w">viscoelastic</a> dampers, which helped reduce the amount of sway felt by building occupants.  The trusses supported a 4&#160;inch thick (10&#160;cm) lightweight concrete floor slab, with shear connections for composite action.<sup id="_ref-NIST-chapter1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIST-chapter1" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The towers also incorporated a &#34;hat truss&#34; or &#34;outrigger truss&#34; located between the 107th and 110th floors, which consisted of six trusses along the long axis of core and four along the short axis. This truss system allowed some load redistribution between the perimeter and core columns and supported the transmission tower. It was found to play a key role in the collapse sequence.<sup id="_ref-NIST-chapter1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIST-chapter1" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Fire_and_aircraft_potentials" name="Fire_and_aircraft_potentials"></a><h3>Fire and aircraft potentials</h3>

<p>{{POV}}
Like all modern skyscrapers, the WTC towers were designed to survive major fires, but not necessarily those that involved jet fuel. Though fireproofing had been incorporated in the original construction, more was added after a fire in 1975 that spread to six floors before being extinguished.<sup id="_ref-FEMA_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FEMA" title="">[3]</a></sup> Early tests conducted on steel beams from the WTC show they generally met or were stronger than design requirements.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#34;No building code in the United States has specific design requirements for impact of aircraft,&#34; writes NIST, &#34;and thus, buildings are not specifically designed to withstand the impact of fuel-laden commercial aircraft.&#34;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> But the WTC&#39;s engineers, John Skilling and Leslie Robertson, had also considered the consequences of aircraft impact. After the <a href="/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing" id="w">1993 World Trade Center bombing</a>, Skilling said that the impact of a Boeing 707 plane would cause a great deal of damage and loss of life, mainly because of the ensuing fires, but the structure would not collapse. Skilling commented that, <i>&#34;Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed,&#34;...&#34;The building structure would still be there.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-Nader_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nader" title="">[9]</a></sup> After the 2001 attacks, Leslie Robertson said that, <i>&#34;The two towers were the first structures outside of the military and nuclear industries designed to resist the impact of a jet airliner.&#34;</i> Robertson suggested that the 707 would be <i>&#34;lost in the fog, seeking to land at JFK or at Newark&#34;</i> and noted that <i>&#34;little was known about the effects of a fire from such an aircraft, and no designs were prepared for that circumstance. Indeed, at that time, no fireproofing systems were available to control the effects of such fires.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-Robertson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Robertson" title="">[10]</a></sup> According to Robertson, the modeled aircraft weighed 263,000 lb (119 metric tons) with a flight speed of 180 mph (290 km/h). As FEMA pointed out in its report, this implies a slower and smaller plane than those involved in the actual impacts of 9/11.<sup id="_ref-FEMA_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FEMA" title="">[3]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology, however, was unable to fully document how the buildings were design to anticipate aircraft impact. NIST was informed by the Port Authority that the documents pertaining to the relevant studies were destroyed in the collapse of WTC 1 and the WTC owners documents, held in 7 WTC, were also lost.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Robertson stated that he cannot find a copy of the report and several engineers who worked with him at the time, including the director of Robertson&#39;s department, say they have no knowledge of the study.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

Hijackers flew two <a href="/wiki/Boeing_767" id="w">Boeing 767</a> jet airliners, <a href="/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_11" id="w">American Airlines Flight 11</a> (a 767-200ER) and <a href="/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_175" id="w">United Airlines Flight 175</a> (a 767-200) into the towers. 1 WTC was hit at 8:46 a.m. by Flight 11 between the 99th and 93rd floors. 2 WTC was hit at 9:03 a.m. by Flight 175 between the 85th and 77th floor.</p>
<p>A Boeing 767-200 is 48.5 m (160 ft) long and has a wingspan of 48 m (156 ft), with a capacity of up to 62.2 (-200) or 91 (-200ER) m³ of jet fuel (16,700 or 24,000 US gallons).<sup id="_ref-Jane's_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jane's" title="">[15]</a></sup>  The planes hit the towers at very high speeds. Flight 11 was traveling roughly 700 km/h (440 mph) when it crashed into the 1 WTC, the north tower; flight 175 hit 2 WTC, the south tower, at about 870 km/h (540 mph).<sup id="_ref-NIST-chapter1_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIST-chapter1" title="">[6]</a></sup> In addition to severing a number of load-bearing columns, the resulting explosions in each tower ignited 38 m³ (10,000 gallons)<sup id="_ref-FEMA_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FEMA" title="">[3]</a></sup> of jet fuel and immediately spread the fire to several different floors while consuming paper, furniture, carpeting, computers, books, walls, framing, and other items in all the affected floors.  The force of the explosion from the initial impact in 1 WTC, traveled through at least one express elevator shaft all the way down to the lobby floor, blowing out all of the windows and leaving a number of people injured.</p>
<a id="The_fires" name="The_fires"></a><h2>The fires</h2>
<p>The light construction and hollow nature of the structures allowed the jet fuel to penetrate far inside the towers, igniting many large fires simultaneously over a wide area of the impacted floors.  The fuel from the planes burned at most for a few minutes, but the contents of the buildings burned over the next hour or hour and a half.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> It has been suggested that the fires might not have been as centrally positioned, nor as intense, had traditionally heavy high-rise construction been standing in the way of the aircraft. Debris and fuel would likely have remained mostly outside the buildings or concentrated in more peripheral areas away from the building cores, which would then not have become unique failure points.  In this scenario, the towers might have stood far longer, perhaps indefinitely.<sup id="_ref-Gross_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gross" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Wilkinson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wilkinson" title="">[18]</a></sup> The fires were hot enough to weaken the columns and cause floors to sag, pulling perimeter columns inward and reducing their ability to support the mass of the building above.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Collapse_of_the_twin_towers" name="Collapse_of_the_twin_towers"></a><h2>Collapse of the twin towers</h2>
<p>At 9:59 a.m. the south tower collapsed, 56 minutes after being struck. The north tower, struck at 8:46 a.m., collapsed at 10:28 a.m., 102 minutes after impact.  The collapses produced enormous clouds of dust that covered Manhattan for days. In both cases, the commonly accepted process is that the damaged portion of the buildings failed, which allowed the section above the airplane 
impacts to fall onto the remaining structure below. Both buildings collapsed symmetrically and more or less straight down, 
though there was some tilting of the tops of the towers and a significant 
amount of fallout to the sides. As the collapse progressed, dust and 
debris could be seen shooting out of the windows several floors below the 
advancing destruction. </p>
<a id="The_collapse_mechanism" name="The_collapse_mechanism"></a><h3>The collapse mechanism</h3>
<p>Owing to differences in the initial impacts, the collapses of the two towers were found to differ in some respects, but in both cases, the same sequence of events applies. After the impacts had severed exterior columns and damaged core columns, the loads on these columns were redistributed. The hat trusses at the top of each building played a significant role in this redistribution of the loads in the structure.<sup id="_ref-NIST_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIST" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The impacts also dislodged some of the fireproofing from the steel, increasing its exposure to the heat of the fires. In the 102 minutes before the collapse of 1 WTC, the fires reached temperatures that, although well below the melting point, were high enough to weaken the core columns so that they underwent <a href="/wiki/Deformation" id="w">plastic deformation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Creep_(deformation)" id="w">creep</a> from the weight of higher floors. The NIST report provides a useful model of the situation.
{{cquote}}</p>
<p>The situation was similar in 2 WTC. In both towers, perimeter columns and floors were also weakened by the heat of the fires, causing the floors to sag and exerting an inward force on exterior walls of the building.</p>
<p>At 9:59 a.m., 56 minutes after impact, the sagging floors finally caused the eastern face of 2 WTC to buckle, transferring its loads back to the failing core through the hat truss and initiating the collapse; the section above the impact area then tilted in the direction of the failed wall. At 10:28 a.m., 102 minutes after the impact, the south wall of 1 WTC buckled, with similar consequences. After collapse ensued, the total collapse of the towers was inevitable due to the enormous weight of the towers above the impact areas.</p>
<p>A combination of three factors allowed the north tower to remain standing longer: the region of impact was higher (so the gravity load on the most damaged area was lighter); the speed of the plane was lower (so there was less impact damage); and the affected floors had received partially upgraded fire proofing.<sup id="_ref-NIST_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIST" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>While the NIST report analyzes the initial failure mechanism in detail, it does not address the subsequent total collapse of the WTC towers.

<p>The WTC complex comprised seven buildings, three of which completely collapsed on the day of the attacks. At 5:20 p.m., <a href="/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center" id="w">7 World Trade Center</a>, a 47-story steel-frame skyscraper across the street from the rest of the complex, became the third building to collapse. Unlike the Twin Towers, the collapse of WTC 7 had been anticipated for several hours and the building had been evacuated.  A transit (or <a href="/wiki/Theodolite" id="w">theodolite</a>) was used to measure the extent of a visible bulge.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> </p>
<p>FEMA&#39;s provisional study was inconclusive<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> and the collapse of 7 WTC was not included in the final report of the NIST investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center when it was published in September of 2005.

<p>NIST released a progress report in June of 2004 outlining its working hypothesis.

<p>The collapse of the World Trade Center came as a surprise to engineers. &#34;Before 9/11,&#34; wrote the <i>New Civil Engineer</i>, &#34;it had been genuinely inconceivable that structures of such magnitude could succumb to this fate.&#34;<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> While the initial damage from the airplanes was severe, it was localized to a few floors of each tower.

Interviewed by the <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a> in October 2001, the British architect Bob Halvorson correctly predicted that there would be &#34;a debate about whether or not the World Trade Center Towers should have collapsed in the way that they did.&#34; The autopsy would involve careful analysis of the plans of the WTC, its construction, eye witness testimony, video of the collapses, and examination of the wreckage.

<p>A team was quickly assembled by the Structural Engineers Institute (SEI) of the <a href="/wiki/American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers" id="w">American Society of Civil Engineers</a>, with the <a href="/wiki/American_Institute_of_Steel_Construction" id="w">American Institute of Steel Construction</a>, the <a href="/wiki/American_Concrete_Institute" id="w">American Concrete Institute</a>, the <a href="/wiki/National_Fire_Protection_Association" id="w">National Fire Protection Association</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Society_of_Fire_Protection_Engineers" id="w">Society of Fire Protection Engineers</a> also involved.<sup id="_ref-enr-20010924_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-enr-20010924" title="">[39]</a></sup> ASCE also invited <a href="/wiki/FEMA" id="w">FEMA</a> to join the investigation, which later became a joint ASCE-FEMA effort.<sup id="_ref-enr-20010924_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-enr-20010924" title="">[39]</a></sup>  This investigation was criticized by engineers and lawmakers in the US, however, for its limited funding, authority to conduct an investigation, and access to the WTC site. One major point of contention at the time was that the cleanup of the WTC site was resulting in the destruction of the majority of the buildings&#39; steel components.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Indeed, when NIST published its final report it noted &#34;the scarcity of physical evidence&#34; that it had had at its disposal to investigate the collapses. Only a fraction of a percent of the buildings remained for analysis after the cleanup was completed: some 236 individual pieces of steel.<sup id="_ref-NIST_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIST" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>FEMA published its report in May of 2002. While NIST had already announced its intention to investigate the collapses in August of the same year, by <a href="/wiki/September_11" id="w">September 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, a year after the disaster, there was growing public pressure for a more thorough investigation.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Congress passed the National Construction Safety Team bill in October 2002. This provided the authority for the NIST investigation, which published its results in September of 2005.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<a id="FEMA's_pancake_collapse_theory" name="FEMA's_pancake_collapse_theory"></a><h3>FEMA&#39;s pancake collapse theory</h3>
<p>FEMA developed an early explanation of the collapses, which had come to be known as the &#34;pancake&#34; theory. It was defended especially by Thomas Eagar and popularized by PBS.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> On this view, when the connections between the floor trusses and the columns broke, the floors fell down, one on top of the other, quickly exceeding the load that any one floor was designed to carry.<sup id="_ref-Eagar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eagar" title="">[44]</a></sup> A number of self-published accounts by structural engineers suggested that a combination of factors led to the collapse, but most suggested a version of pancake collapse.<sup id="_ref-Clifton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Clifton" title="">[45]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Wilkinson_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wilkinson" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

As in the theory which is currently accepted, the fires were taken to be the key to the collapses. Thomas Eagar, an <a href="/wiki/MIT" id="w">MIT</a> materials professor, had described the fires as &#34;the most misunderstood part of the WTC collapse&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Eagar_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eagar" title="">[44]</a></sup> This is because the fires were originally said to have &#34;melted&#34; the floors and columns. As Eagar said, &#34;The temperature of the fire at the WTC was not unusual, and it was most definitely not capable of melting steel.&#34; <a href="/wiki/Jet_fuel" id="w">Jet fuel</a> is essentially kerosene and would have served mainly to ignite very large, but not unusually hot, hydrocarbon fires. This led Eagar, FEMA and others to focus on what appeared to be the weakest point of the structures, namely, the points at which the floors were attached to the building frame. Once these connections failed, the pancake collapse could initiate.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> The NIST report, however, would ultimately vindicate the floor connections; indeed, the collapse mechanism depends on the strength of these connections as the floors pulled the outer walls in.</p>
<a id="Early_column_failure_theories" name="Early_column_failure_theories"></a><h3>Early column failure theories</h3>
<p>However, NIST&#39;s column failure theory had already been articulated, not least by Bažant and Zhou. MIT civil engineers Oral Buyukozturk and Franz-Josef Ulm, probably following Bažant&#39;s early proposal, also described a collapse mechanism that was very close to the current consensus already on <a href="/wiki/September_21" id="w">September 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>.</p>

<a id="Scope_and_limits" name="Scope_and_limits"></a><h4>Scope and limits</h4>
<p>The scope of the NIST investigation was limited to &#34;the sequence of events from the instant of aircraft impact to the initiation of collapse for each tower&#34; and &#34;includes little analysis of the structural behavior of the tower after the conditions for collapse initiation were reached and collapse became inevitable.&#34;<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> In line with the concerns of most engineers, NIST focused on the airplane impacts and the spread and effects of the fires, modeling these at a very high level of detail. NIST developed several highly detailed structural models for specific sub-systems such as the floor trusses as well as a global model of the towers as a whole which is less detailed.  These models are <a href="/wiki/Statics" id="w">static</a> or quasi-static, including <a href="/wiki/Deformation" id="w">deformation</a> but not the motion of structural elements after rupture as would <a href="/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)" id="w">dynamic</a> models.  So, the NIST models are useful for determining how the collapse was triggered, but do not shed light on events after that point.</p>
<a id="Ongoing_investigations" name="Ongoing_investigations"></a><h3>Ongoing investigations</h3>
<p>In 2003, three engineers at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" id="w">University of Edinburgh</a>, published a paper in which they provisionally concluded that the fires alone (without any damage from the airplanes) could have been enough to bring down the WTC buildings. In their view, the towers were uniquely vulnerable to the effects of large fires on several floors at the same time.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup>  When the NIST report was published, Barbara Lane, with the UK engineering firm <a href="/wiki/Arup" id="w">Arup</a>, criticized its conclusion that the           structural damage resulting from the airplane impacts was a necessary factor in causing the collapses.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> Recently, <a href="/wiki/Jose_L_Torero" id="w">Jose L Torero</a>, from the <a href="/wiki/BRE_Centre_for_Fire_Safety_Engineering" id="w">BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering</a> at the University of Edinburgh, is pursuing further research into the potentially catastrophic effects of <a href="/wiki/Dalmarnock_tests" id="w">fire on real-scale buildings</a>.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Criticism" name="Criticism"></a><h3>Criticism</h3>

<p>James Quintiere, Professor of Fire Protection Engineering at the University of Maryland, called the spoliation of the steel &#34;a gross error&#34; that NIST should have openly criticized.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> He also noted that the report lacks a timeline and physical evidence to support its conclusions.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some engineers have suggested that our understanding of the collapse mechanism could be improved by developing an animated sequence of the collapses based on a global dynamic model, and comparing it with the video evidence of the actual collapses. In October of 2005, the <a href="/wiki/New_Civil_Engineer" id="w">New Civil Engineer</a> reported criticism of NIST&#39;s computer modelling. Colin Bailey at the University of Manchester, and Rober Plank at the University of Sheffiled called on NIST to produce computer visualizations of the collapses in order to correlate the collapse models with observed events.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
