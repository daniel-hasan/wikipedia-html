<p><b>Northlew</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Village" id="w">village</a> and <a href="/wiki/Civil_parish" id="w">civil parish</a> in the <a href="/wiki/West_Devon" id="w">West Devon</a> <a href="/wiki/District" id="w">district</a> of the county of <a href="/wiki/Devon" id="w">Devon</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, located at 50.77° N 4.12° W, <a href="/wiki/British_national_grid_reference_system" id="w">UK National Grid</a> reference SX5099.  The <a href="/wiki/UK_postcodes" id="w">post code</a> for the village <a href="/wiki/Post_office" id="w">post office</a> is EX20 3NZ. </p>
<p>The village is approximately 7 miles (11Km) northwest of the town of <a href="/wiki/Okehampton" id="w">Okehampton</a>, and most places in the village have excellent views over <a href="/wiki/Dartmoor" id="w">Dartmoor</a>.  The village is relatively isolated, not being served by any main roads.  It has an attractive main square surrounded by traditional buildings, some of them <a href="/wiki/Thatch" id="w">thatched</a>; just off the square are a <a href="/wiki/Pub" id="w">pub</a>, the local <a href="/wiki/Primary_school" id="w">primary school</a> and two churches, the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" id="w">Church of England</a> parish church of <a href="/wiki/Saint_Thomas_Becket" id="w">Saint Thomas Becket</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Methodism" id="w">Methodist</a> church (originally <a href="/wiki/Bible_Christian" id="w">Bible Christian</a>).  The <a href="/wiki/Ecclesiastical_parish" id="w">ecclesiastical parish</a> of Northlew has been combined with the neighbouring village of Ashbury, and since the school is a Church of England <a href="/wiki/Voluntary_controlled_school" id="w">voluntary controlled school</a>, it bears the name of both villages.</p>
<p>Historically, Northlew formed part of <a href="/wiki/Black_Torrington" id="w">Black Torrington</a> <a href="/wiki/Hundred_(division)" id="w">Hundred</a>.  It gets its name from the ancient <a href="/wiki/Manorialism" id="w">manor</a> of Lew, mentioned in the <a href="/wiki/Domesday_Book" id="w">Domesday Book</a>; the village of <a href="/wiki/Lewdown" id="w">Lewdown</a> and the <a href="/wiki/River_Lew" id="w">River Lew</a> are nearby.  The village has the melancholy distinction of having lost the highest proportion of its enlisting population of any municipality in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> during the <a href="/wiki/First_World_War" id="w">First World War</a>: of 100 men who enlisted in the forces, 24 died.  A stone memorial to them was recently erected in the churchyard, replacing wooden memorial tablets within the church.</p>
