<b>Hurricane Karen</b> was the eleventh <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">named storm</a> and fourth hurricane of the <a href="/wiki/2007_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">2007 Atlantic hurricane season</a>.<sup id="_ref-reuters_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reuters" title="">[1]</a></sup> Karen was a <a href="/wiki/Cape_Verde-type_hurricane" id="w">Cape Verde-type hurricane</a> that developed in the eastern tropical <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic</a> out of a large tropical wave. The storm briefly reached <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 1</a> hurricane intensity before slowly weakening due to increased <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a>.</p>

The system began as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_21" id="w">September 21</a>. The wave was not well-organized with only scattered <a href="/wiki/Thunderstorm" id="w">thunderstorm</a> activity and large area of <a href="/wiki/Low_pressure_area" id="w">low pressure</a>. As the system tracked westward south of <a href="/wiki/Cape_Verde" id="w">Cape Verde</a>, deep convection gradually increased, curved banding features became defined, and a poorly-defined circulation became evident. Early on <a href="/wiki/September_23" id="w">September 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dvorak_technique" id="w">Dvorak classification</a> estimates were introduced. Little change in organization took place until the evening of <a href="/wiki/September_24" id="w">September 24</a>. That evening, the low-level circulation and banding features became better defined as the system tracked west-northwest. Late that evening, the system was declared <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Intensity classifications" id="w">Tropical Depression</a> Twelve while west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands.<sup id="_ref-karentcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-karentcr" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The tropical depression quickly intensified into early on <a href="/wiki/September_25" id="w">September 25</a> as the system continued to organize, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karen that morning.<sup id="_ref-12LDisc2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12LDisc2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The strengthening trend was temporarily halted, and Karen remained a weak tropical storm with relatively shallow convection. Late that evening, new bursts of deep convection developed with the storm.<sup id="_ref-12LDisc5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12LDisc5" title="">[4]</a></sup> Early on <a href="/wiki/September_26" id="w">September 26</a>, Karen intensified significantly and an inner core began to develop.<sup id="_ref-12LDisc6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12LDisc6" title="">[5]</a></sup> That morning, a ragged <a href="/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)" id="w">eye</a> developed and the system strengthened into a hurricane with 75 mph (120 km/h) winds.<sup id="_ref-karentcr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-karentcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> The intensification trend was short-lived, and the storm leveled off that afternoon as upper-level <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a> increased substantially due to the presence of a nearby <a href="/wiki/Tropical_Upper_Tropospheric_Trough" id="w">tropical upper tropospheric trough</a>.<sup id="_ref-12LDisc8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12LDisc8" title="">[6]</a></sup> The storm became less organized that evening. Hurricane Karen weakened to a tropical storm as flight data from <a href="/wiki/NOAA" id="w">NOAA</a> <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Hunters" id="w">Hurricane Hunters</a> confirmed surface winds of 72 mph (115 km/h) and a very large wind field late that evening.<sup id="_ref-12LDisc9_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12LDisc9" title="">[7]</a></sup> Operationally, Karen was classified as a strong tropical storm, but was reclassified as a Category 1 hurricane based on data from the <a href="/wiki/Reconnaissance" id="w">reconnaissance</a> flight late on September 26 and the less organized structure of the storm at that time.<sup id="_ref-karentcr_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-karentcr" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

A slow weakening trend began early on <a href="/wiki/September_27" id="w">September 27</a> due to the increased shear while remaining on a west-northwest track.<sup id="_ref-12LDisc10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12LDisc10" title="">[8]</a></sup> At the same time, the center of circulation became exposed at times due to the southwesterly wind shear. As a result, an unusual wind field was observed in that the strongest winds were recorded well to the east and to the northwest of the center.<sup id="_ref-12LDisc11_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12LDisc11" title="">[9]</a></sup> The weakening trend remained fairly slow that evening as the storm continued to produce persistent deep convection.<sup id="_ref-12LDisc13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12LDisc13" title="">[10]</a></sup> The weakening trend accelerated on <a href="/wiki/September_28" id="w">September 28</a> as the convection weakened and the circulation became more disorganized in the high-shear environment.<sup id="_ref-12LDisc14_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12LDisc14" title="">[11]</a></sup> By that morning, Karen weakened to a minimal tropical storm with 40 mph (65 km/h) winds.<sup id="_ref-12LDisc15_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12LDisc15" title="">[12]</a></sup> Karen also turned abruptly to the north for a short while, as convection interacted with the low-level center and southerly winds increased in the low-level environment.<sup id="_ref-karentcr_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-karentcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> The weakening trend slowed that afternoon as deep convection returned to the disorganized storm.<sup id="_ref-12LDisc16_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12LDisc16" title="">[13]</a></sup> Early on <a href="/wiki/September_29" id="w">September 29</a>, the high wind shear continued and Karen weakened to a tropical depression with a very poorly-defined center.<sup id="_ref-karentcr_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-karentcr" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12LDisc19_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12LDisc19" title="">[14]</a></sup> That afternoon, the circulation dissipated while east of the <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Antilles" id="w">Lesser Antilles</a>. Remnant squalls continued across the area east of the Lesser Antilles for a few days after dissipation.<sup id="_ref-karentcr_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-karentcr" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Impact" name="Impact"></a><h2>Impact</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> briefly assessed a minimal threat to the <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Antilles" id="w">Lesser Antilles</a>, with one forecaster noting a 5% probability for the cyclone to produce tropical storm winds on <a href="/wiki/Barbuda" id="w">Barbuda</a>.<sup id="_ref-karen14_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-karen14" title="">[15]</a></sup> However, Karen stayed in the open Atlantic Ocean and never affected any land area. No incidents of damage or casualties were reported.<sup id="_ref-karentcr_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-karentcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> No <a href="/wiki/Ship" id="w">ship</a> reports of tropical storm-force or stronger were received.<sup id="_ref-karentcr_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-karentcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> Some of the <a href="/wiki/Vorticity" id="w">vorticity</a> from Karen&#39;s remnants may have been responsible for the development of the short-lived <a href="/wiki/2007_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Tropical Depression Fifteen" id="w">Tropical Depression Fifteen</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_11" id="w">October 11</a>.<sup id="_ref-15LDisc1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15LDisc1" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
