<p><b>John Wilkes Booth</b> (<a href="/wiki/May_10" id="w">May 10</a> <a href="/wiki/1838" id="w">1838</a> – <a href="/wiki/April_26" id="w">April 26</a> <a href="/wiki/1865" id="w">1865</a>) was an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> stage <a href="/wiki/Actor" id="w">actor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" id="w">Confederate</a> sympathizer who assassinated <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" id="w">Abraham Lincoln</a>, the 16th <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President of the United States</a>, at <a href="/wiki/Ford%26%2339%3Bs_Theatre" id="w">Ford&#39;s Theatre</a> in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a> on <a href="/wiki/April_14" id="w">April 14</a> <a href="/wiki/1865" id="w">1865</a>. Lincoln died the next day from a single gunshot wound to the head, becoming the first American president to be assassinated.</p>
<p>Booth was a successful professional stage actor from <a href="/wiki/Maryland" id="w">Maryland</a>, and a member of the prominent <a href="/wiki/Booth_family" id="w">Booth family</a> of actors. He expressed vehement dissatisfaction with the South&#39;s defeat in the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">Civil War</a> and Lincoln&#39;s proposal to extend <a href="/wiki/Suffrage" id="w">voting rights</a> to recently emancipated <a href="/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States" id="w">slaves</a>.</p>
<p>Booth and a group of co-conspirators led by him planned to kill Abraham Lincoln, <a href="/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States" id="w">Vice President</a> <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Johnson" id="w">Andrew Johnson</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State" id="w">Secretary of State</a> <a href="/wiki/William_Henry_Seward%2C_Sr." id="w">William Seward</a>, and <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War" id="w">Secretary of War</a> <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Stanton" id="w">Edwin Stanton</a> in a desperate bid to help the tottering Confederacy&#39;s cause. Although <a href="/wiki/Robert_E._Lee" id="w">Robert E. Lee</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Army_of_Northern_Virginia" id="w">Army of Northern Virginia</a> had surrendered four days earlier, Booth believed the war was not yet over since Confederate General <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Johnston" id="w">Joseph Johnston</a>&#39;s army was still fighting the <a href="/wiki/Union_Army" id="w">Union Army</a> under <a href="/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman" id="w">General Sherman</a>. Of the conspirators, only Booth was successful in carrying out his part of the plot.</p>
<p>Following the shooting, Booth fled by horseback to southern Maryland and eventually to a farm in rural northern <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a>, where he was tracked down and killed by Union soldiers two weeks later. Several of the other conspirators were tried and hanged shortly thereafter.</p>
<a id="Background_and_early_life" name="Background_and_early_life"></a><h2>Background and early life</h2>
<p>His parents, the noted <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Shakespearean" id="w">Shakespearean</a> actor <a href="/wiki/Junius_Brutus_Booth" id="w">Junius Brutus Booth</a> and his actress wife Mary Ann Holmes, emigrated to the United States from England in 1821, purchasing a farm near <a href="/wiki/Bel_Air%2C_Harford_County%2C_Maryland" id="w">Bel Air</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maryland" id="w">Maryland</a>, where John Wilkes Booth was born in 1838.<sup id="_ref-CourtTV_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CourtTV" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> He was named after the British revolutionary <a href="/wiki/John_Wilkes" id="w">John Wilkes</a>, whom the family claimed was a distant relative.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Booth was educated in the classic literature, particularly Shakespeare. He attended the Bel Air Academy, where his headmaster described him as &#34;Not deficient in intelligence, but disinclined to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered him. Each day he rode back and forth from farm to school, taking more interest in what happened along the way than in reaching his classes on time&#34;.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1850-1851, he attended Milton Boarding School for Boys located in <a href="/wiki/Sparks%2C_Maryland" id="w">Sparks, Maryland</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> As recounted by Booth&#39;s sister, <a href="/wiki/Asia_Booth" id="w">Asia Booth</a> Clarke, in her book entitled &#34;<i>The Unlocked Book</i>,&#34; the future actor met an old Gypsy woman in the woods near the school who gave him a grim assessment of his life and said he would die young.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> In 1851, at age 13, Booth attended St. Timothy&#39;s Hall, a military academy in <a href="/wiki/Catonsville" id="w">Catonsville</a>, Maryland. Following in the footsteps of their father (who had died in 1852), Booth and his brothers <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Booth" id="w">Edwin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Junius_Brutus_Booth%2C_Jr." id="w">Junius Brutus, Jr.</a> would become well-known actors in mid-nineteenth century America.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

At the age of 17, Booth played the Earl of Richmond in <a href="/wiki/Shakespeare" id="w">Shakespeare</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Richard_III_(play)" id="w">Richard III</a></i>, but did not act again until 1857, when he joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Philadelphia</a>. At his request he was billed as &#34;J.B. Wilkes&#34;, a pseudonym meant to divert attention away from his famous <a href="/wiki/Actor" id="w">thespian</a> family. In 1858 he was accepted as a member of the Richmond Theatre, Virginia, stock company, and became increasingly popular, called &#34;the handsomest man in America&#34; by reviewers. He stood 5&#160;feet, 8&#160;inches tall, had jet-black hair, and was lean and athletic. He was also an excellent swordsman. His performances were often characterized by his contemporaries as acrobatic and intensely physical.<sup id="_ref-townsend_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-townsend" title="">[8]</a></sup> A fellow actress once recalled that he occasionally cut himself with his own sword. </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/December_2" id="w">December 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1859" id="w">1859</a>, Booth attended the hanging of militant  <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism" id="w">abolitionist</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Brown_(abolitionist)" id="w">John Brown</a>, who was executed for leading a raid on the Federal <a href="/wiki/Armory_(military)" id="w">armory</a> at <a href="/wiki/Harpers_Ferry%2C_West_Virginia" id="w">Harpers Ferry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a> (in present-day <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia" id="w">West Virginia</a>).<sup id="_ref-townsend_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-townsend" title="">[8]</a></sup> Booth bought a uniform from a member of the Richmond Grays militia unit, which was heading for <a href="/wiki/Charles_Town%2C_West_Virginia" id="w">Charles Town</a>, and he joined the Grays, who stood guard for Brown&#39;s trial. When Brown was hanged, Booth stood at the foot of the scaffold.<sup id="_ref-CourtTV_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CourtTV" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln was elected president on <a href="/wiki/November_6" id="w">November 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1860" id="w">1860</a>, and the following month Booth wrote a long speech that decried what he saw as Northern abolitionism and made clear his strong support of the South and the institution of <a href="/wiki/Slavery" id="w">slavery</a>. On <a href="/wiki/April_12" id="w">April 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1861" id="w">1861</a>, the Civil War erupted, and eventually eleven Southern states seceded from the Union. Booth&#39;s family was from <a href="/wiki/Maryland" id="w">Maryland</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Border_states_(Civil_War)" id="w">border state</a> which remained in the Union during the war despite a slaveholding portion of the population that favored the Confederacy. Because Maryland shared a border with Washington, D.C., Lincoln declared <a href="/wiki/Martial_law" id="w">martial law</a> in Maryland and ordered the imprisonment of pro-secession Maryland political leaders at <a href="/wiki/Ft._McHenry" id="w">Ft. McHenry</a> to prevent the state&#39;s secession, a move that many, including Booth, viewed as <a href="/wiki/Unconstitutional" id="w">unconstitutional</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Booth was pro-Confederate, his family, like many Marylanders, was divided, and to preserve harmony among his brothers, Booth promised his mother that he would not enlist in the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_Army" id="w">Confederate Army</a>. As a popular actor in the 1860s, he travelled extensively to perform in both North and South, and as far west as <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana" id="w">New Orleans</a>.<sup id="_ref-townsend_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-townsend" title="">[8]</a></sup> Booth was outspoken in his love for the South, and equally outspoken in his hatred for Lincoln. In early 1862, Booth was arrested by a provost marshal in <a href="/wiki/Saint_Louis%2C_Missouri" id="w">St. Louis</a> for making anti-government remarks.</p>
<p>Booth and Lincoln crossed paths on several occasions. Lincoln was an avid theater-goer and especially loved Shakespeare. On <a href="/wiki/November_9" id="w">November 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/1863" id="w">1863</a>, President Lincoln saw Booth playing Raphael in Charles Selby&#39;s <i>The Marble Heart</i> at <a href="/wiki/Ford%26%2339%3Bs_Theatre" id="w">Ford&#39;s Theatre</a> in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D._C." id="w">Washington</a>. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln&#39;s direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln sat in the same &#34;presidential box&#34; in which he would later be assassinated.<sup id="_ref-CourtTV_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CourtTV" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Booth made a final appearance at Ford&#39;s on <a href="/wiki/March_18" id="w">March 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1865" id="w">1865</a>, when he played Duke Pescara in <i>The Apostate</i> in what was the last appearance of his career. However, Booth&#39;s family were long time friends with <a href="/wiki/John_T._Ford" id="w">John T. Ford</a>, the theater&#39;s owner, and Booth was in and out of the theater so often during the war that he even had his mail sent there.<sup id="_ref-townsend_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-townsend" title="">[8]</a></sup> This granted Booth complete access to Ford&#39;s Theatre, day and night.</p>
<a id="Plotting_to_kidnap_Lincoln" name="Plotting_to_kidnap_Lincoln"></a><h2>Plotting to kidnap Lincoln</h2>
<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Soldiers-Home-Lincoln-Cottage.jpg" title="Booth&#39;s plan was to kidnap Lincoln from the Old Soldiers Home"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldiers-Home-Lincoln-Cottage.jpg" alt="Booth&#39;s plan was to kidnap Lincoln from the Old Soldiers Home" title="Booth&#39;s plan was to kidnap Lincoln from the Old Soldiers Home" class="location-none type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Booth&#39;s plan was to kidnap Lincoln from the Old Soldiers Home</div>
By 1864, the tide of the war had shifted in the North&#39;s favor. The North halted prisoner exchange in an attempt to diminish the size of the Confederate Army, and because the Confederates refused to exchange captured African-American soldiers. Booth began devising a plan to kidnap Lincoln from his summer residence at the <a href="/wiki/President_Lincoln_and_Soldiers%26%2339%3B_Home_National_Monument" id="w">Old Soldiers Home</a> three miles (5 km) from the White House and smuggle him across the Potomac and into Richmond. He would be exchanged for the release of around 10,000 Southern soldiers held captive in Northern prisons. He successfully recruited his old friends Samuel Arnold and Michael O&#39;Laughlin as accomplices.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the summer of 1864, Booth met with several well-known Confederate sympathizers at <a href="/wiki/The_Parker_House" id="w">The Parker House</a> in <a href="/wiki/Boston%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. In October, 1864, he made an unexplained trip to <a href="/wiki/Montreal" id="w">Montreal</a>. At the time, Montreal was a well-known center of clandestine Confederate activities. He spent ten days in the city and stayed for a time at St. Lawrence Hall, a meeting place for the Confederate Secret Service, and met at least one blockade runner there. It is possible that it was here that he also met Confederate Secret Service director <a href="/wiki/James_D._Bulloch" id="w">James D. Bulloch</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/George_Nicholas_Sanders" id="w">George Nicholas Sanders</a>, a one-time U.S. ambassador to Britain. Booth is believed to have been active in the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Knights_of_the_Golden_Circle" id="w">Knights of the Golden Circle</a>&#34;, described as a &#34;nest of &#39;Secesh&#39; spies&#34; (that is, pro-<a href="/wiki/Secessionist" id="w">secessionist</a>).<sup id="_ref-CourtTV_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CourtTV" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>There has been much scholarly attention devoted to why Booth was in Montreal at this time, and what he was doing there. No solid evidence has ever linked Booth&#39;s kidnapping or assassination plot to a conspiracy involving any elements of the Confederate government, although this possibility had been explored at some length in two books; Nathan Miller&#39;s <i>Spying For America</i> and William Tidwell&#39;s <i>Come Retribution: the Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln</i>.   </p>
<p>Booth began to devote more and more of his energy and money to his plot to kidnap Abraham Lincoln after his re-election in early November, 1864. He assembled a loose-knit band of Southern sympathizers, including <a href="/wiki/David_Herold" id="w">David Herold</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Atzerodt" id="w">George Atzerodt</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Surratt" id="w">John Surratt</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Powell_(assassin)" id="w">Lewis Powell</a> (also known as Lewis Payne). They began to meet routinely at the boarding-house of Surratt&#39;s mother, Mrs. <a href="/wiki/Mary_Surratt" id="w">Mary Surratt</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_25" id="w">November 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1864" id="w">1864</a>, John Wilkes performed for the first and only time with his two brothers, <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Booth" id="w">Edwin</a> and Junius, in a single engagement production of <i><a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(play)" id="w">Julius Caesar</a></i> at the <a href="/wiki/Winter_Garden_Theater" id="w">Winter Garden Theater</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>. The proceeds went towards a statue of <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" id="w">William Shakespeare</a> for <a href="/wiki/Central_Park" id="w">Central Park</a> which still stands today. The performance was interrupted by a failed attempt by clandestine Confederate agents to burn down several hotels, and by extension the city of New York, with <a href="/wiki/Greek_fire" id="w">Greek fire</a>. One of the hotels was next door to the theater, but the fire was quickly extinguished. The following morning, Booth argued bitterly with his brother, Edwin Booth, about Lincoln and the war. </p>
<p>Three months later, Booth attended Lincoln&#39;s second inauguration on <a href="/wiki/March_4" id="w">March 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1865" id="w">1865</a> as the invited guest of his secret fiancée, Lucy Hale. (Lucy&#39;s father, <a href="/wiki/John_P._Hale" id="w">John P. Hale</a>, was Lincoln&#39;s minister to <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>.) In the crowd below were Powell, Atzerodt, and Herold. There seems to have been no attempt to kidnap or assassinate Lincoln during the inauguration. Later, however, Booth remarked about &#34;what a wonderful chance&#34; he had to shoot Lincoln, if he had so chosen.<sup id="_ref-CourtTV_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CourtTV" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>On March 17, Booth learned at the last minute that Lincoln would be attending a performance of the play <i>Still Waters Run Deep</i> at a hospital near the Soldier&#39;s Home. Booth assembled his team on a stretch of road near the Soldier&#39;s Home in the attempt to kidnap Lincoln en route to the hospital, but the president never showed up. Booth later learned that the President had changed his plans at the last moment to attend a reception at the National Hotel in Washington, where ironically Booth was staying at the time.<sup id="_ref-CourtTV_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CourtTV" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Although Mr. Weichmann did not understand the reference, <i>Venice Preserv&#39;d</i> is about an assassination plot.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_11" id="w">April 11</a>, Booth was in the crowd outside the White House when Lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window.

He immediately set about making plans for the assassination, which included a getaway horse waiting outside, and an escape route. Booth informed Powell, Herold and Atzerodt of his intention to kill Lincoln. He assigned Powell to assassinate Secretary of State Seward and Atzerodt to assassinate Vice-President Johnson. Herold would assist in their escape into Virginia.<sup id="_ref-townsend_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-townsend" title="">[8]</a></sup>

By targeting the President and his two immediate successors to the office, Booth seems to have intended to decapitate the Union government and throw it into a state of panic and confusion. Booth also planned to assassinate the Union commanding general, <a href="/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant" id="w">Ulysses S. Grant</a>; however, Grant&#39;s wife had promised to visit family and so they were heading to New Jersey. Booth had hoped that the assassinations would create sufficient chaos within the Union that the Confederate government could reorganize and continue the war. </p>
<p>As a famous and popular actor, Booth was a friend of the owner of Ford&#39;s Theatre, <a href="/wiki/John_T._Ford" id="w">John T. Ford</a>, and had free access to all parts of the theater. Boring a spyhole into the presidential box earlier that day, the assassin could see if his intended victim had made it to the play. That evening, at around 10 p.m., as the play progressed, John Wilkes Booth slipped into Lincoln&#39;s box and shot him in the back of the head with a .44 caliber <a href="/wiki/Derringer" id="w">Derringer</a>.

<p>Detective Conger tracked down Jett and interrogated him, learning of Booth&#39;s location at the Garrett farm. Early in the morning of <a href="/wiki/April_26" id="w">April 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1865" id="w">1865</a>, the soldiers caught up with Booth there. Trapped in a <a href="/wiki/Tobacco" id="w">tobacco</a> barn, <a href="/wiki/David_Herold" id="w">David Herold</a> surrendered. Booth refused to surrender and the soldiers then set the barn ablaze.<sup id="_ref-UMKC_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UMKC" title="">[13]</a></sup><div style="wigth:200px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:200px-Garrett_Farm.gif" title="The porch of the Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died in 1865"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200px-Garrett_Farm.gif" alt="The porch of the Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died in 1865" title="The porch of the Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died in 1865" class="location-right type-thumb" width="200px" />

 <a href="/wiki/Boston_Corbett" id="w">Boston Corbett</a> fired at Booth &#8212; whether orders to shoot were given is uncertain &#8212; fatally wounding him in the neck. Booth was dragged from the barn and died three hours later, at age 26, on the porch of the Garrett farmhouse. The bullet had severed his spinal cord, paralyzing him. In his last dying moments, he reportedly whispered &#34;tell my mother I did it for my country,&#34; and asked for both his hands to be raised to his face so he could see them.  He looked at them and uttered his <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Last_words"> final words</a>, &#34;Useless, useless,&#34; and died as dawn was breaking.<sup id="_ref-NPS_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NPS" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

The body was then buried in a storage room at the Old Penitentiary at the Washington Arsenal. When the prison was razed in 1867, the body was moved to a warehouse on the Arsenal grounds. In 1869, the remains were once again identified before being released to the Booth family, where they were buried in the family plot at <a href="/wiki/Greenmount_Cemetery" id="w">Greenmount Cemetery</a> in <a href="/wiki/Baltimore%2C_Maryland" id="w">Baltimore</a>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

An early popularizer of &#34;Booth Escape&#34; theories was <a href="/wiki/Finis_L._Bates" id="w">Finis L. Bates</a> who claimed to have met Booth in <a href="/wiki/Granbury%2C_Texas" id="w">Granbury, Texas</a> in the 1870s and later to have taken possession of Booth&#39;s body after his suicide in <a href="/wiki/Enid%2C_Oklahoma" id="w">Enid, Oklahoma</a> in 1903. He toured the mummified body in carnival sideshows and wrote <i>The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth</i> (1907) in order to authenticate the mummy.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/The_Lincoln_Conspiracy_(book)" id="w">&#39;&#39;The Lincoln Conspiracy&#39;&#39;</a> <sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> details the assassination, the Boyd plot, and Booth&#39;s escape to the swamps. <i>The Curse of Cain: The Untold Story of John Wilkes Booth</i>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> continues with the claim that Booth escaped, sought refuge in <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> and eventually returned to the United States where he died in <a href="/wiki/Enid%2C_Oklahoma" id="w">Enid, Oklahoma</a> in 1903. Another is that a man claiming to be Booth lived into the 1900s in <a href="/wiki/Missouri" id="w">Missouri</a>. In recent years, a legal attempt was mounted to force the exhumation of Booth&#39;s presumed remains in order to conduct a photo-superimposition study. This was blocked by Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Joseph H. H. Kaplan, who cited, among other things, &#34;the unreliability of petitioners&#39; less-than-convincing escape/cover-up theory&#34; as a major factor in his decision. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals upheld the ruling. <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> FBI records that were made public give no information to support the escape theory.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
