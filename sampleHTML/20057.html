<b>Mumia Abu-Jamal</b> ({{pronEng}}); (born <b>Wesley Cook</b> on <a href="/wiki/April_24" id="w">April 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1954" id="w">1954</a>) was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1981 murder of police officer <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Faulkner" id="w">Daniel Faulkner</a>, and is currently a prisoner at State Correctional Institution - Greene near <a href="/wiki/Waynesburg%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Waynesburg, Pennsylvania</a>. In December 2001 a judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania affirmed the conviction but quashed his original punishment and ordered resentencing. Both Abu-Jamal and the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Pennsylvania" id="w">Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</a> appealed. The case was orally argued before a three-judge panel in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Philadelphia on <a href="/wiki/May_17" id="w">May 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, and is pending.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>His case has received international attention. Supporters and human rights campaigners variously assert that he is innocent, that he was setup, that he did not receive a <a href="/wiki/Fair_trial" id="w">fair trial</a>, and/or oppose the <a href="/wiki/Death_penalty" id="w">death penalty</a>. Opponents assert that he is guilty, that he received the benefit of <a href="/wiki/Due_process" id="w">due process</a> and was legitimately convicted of murder. Execution proponents among these assert that under Pennsylvania law his eventual judicial execution is warranted and mandated by the nature of his crime.<sup id="_ref-amn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amn" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-parl_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-parl" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Prior to his arrest he was a <a href="/wiki/Black_Panther_Party" id="w">Black Panther Party</a> activist, cab driver, and journalist. During the period of his imprisonment he has courted controversy as an honoree of municipal, educational and civil society organizations, and as a spoken word commentator and published author of several works - most notably <i><a href="/wiki/Live_from_Death_Row" id="w">Live from Death Row</a></i>.</p>

In the early hours of <a href="/wiki/December_9" id="w">December 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/1981" id="w">1981</a>, around 3:51 a.m., <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Police_Department" id="w">Philadelphia Police Department</a> officer <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Faulkner" id="w">Daniel Faulkner</a> was shot and killed during an altercation that ensued from a routine traffic stop of a vehicle driven by <a href="/wiki/William_Cook_(street_vendor)" id="w">William Cook</a>, Abu-Jamal&#39;s younger brother. During the altercation Abu-Jamal was also shot and wounded. Officers arriving at the scene found a <a href="/wiki/.38_Special" id="w">.38 caliber</a> revolver beside Abu-Jamal that records show he had purchased in 1979. The cylinder of the revolver had five spent cartridges. He was taken directly from the scene of the shooting to a hospital and was treated for his injury. He was charged with the <a href="/wiki/First-degree_murder" id="w">first-degree murder</a> of Daniel Faulkner.

<div class="thumbcaption">Philadelphia City Hall, shown in 2006</div>
The case went to trial in June 1982 at <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_City_Hall" id="w">Philadelphia&#39;s City Hall</a>. The judge initially acquiesced to Abu-Jamal&#39;s request to represent himself, with Jackson continuing to act as his legal advisor. During the first day of the trial, however, Abu-Jamal repeatedly and vociferously dissented from accepting the judge&#39;s rulings on points of law and procedure to the extent that he was removed from representing himself and it was ordered that Jackson resume the role of acting as his sole advocate by reason of what the judge deemed to be intentionally disruptive actions on Abu-Jamal&#39;s part.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> In all, according to his detractors, Abu-Jamal was removed from the courtroom at least 13 times for disruption during the course of the legal proceedings and trial.<sup id="_ref-df2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-df2" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Prosecution_case" name="Prosecution_case"></a><h3>Prosecution case</h3>
<p>At the trial the following sequence of events was presented in evidence by the prosecution:<sup id="_ref-tr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tr" title="">[23]</a></sup> 
</p>
<ol>
<li>During the traffic stop, Cook assaulted Faulkner, who in turn attempted to subdue Cook.</li>
<li>Abu-Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot, crossed the street, and shot Faulkner in the back.</li>
<li>Faulkner was able to return fire, seriously wounding Abu-Jamal.</li>
<li>Abu-Jamal then advanced on Faulkner, fired some additional shots at close range, one of which struck Faulkner in the face causing his death.</li>
<li>Abu-Jamal was unable to flee due to his own gunshot wound, collapsed on a nearby curb, and was taken into custody by other police officers, who had been summoned by Faulkner at the time of the traffic stop.</li></ol>
<a id="Eyewitnesses" name="Eyewitnesses"></a><h4>Eyewitnesses</h4>
<p>Four eyewitnesses, who testified that they were at or in sight of the scene at the time of the shooting, were produced by the prosecution:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Robert Chobert, a disqualified/unlicensed cab driver on parole for <a href="/wiki/Arson" id="w">arson</a>,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> with two arrests for drunk-driving,<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> who in 1995 admitted to having sought the advice of the trial prosecutor as to how he could reclaim his driving privileges;<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></li>
<li>Cynthia White, a prostitute;</li>
<li>Michael Scanlon, a motorist;</li>
<li>Albert Magilton, a pedestrian.</li></ol>
<p>Robert Chobert said he was in his cab parked directly behind Faulkner&#39;s police car. He positively identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter, testifying: &#34;I heard a shot. I looked up, I saw the cop fall to the ground, and then I saw Jamal standing over him and firing some more shots into him...Then I saw him [Jamal] walking back about ten feet and he just fell by the curb.&#34;<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> During cross-examination, he admitted that he had originally told police that the shooter had moved 30 rather than 10&#160;ft away from Faulkner, and had been 30-to-50&#160;pounds heavier than Abu-Jamal. He explained, &#34;I&#39;m not good at weight. Do you think I&#39;m going to stand there for a couple of minutes and ask him how much he weighs?&#34;<sup id="_ref-chobert_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chobert" title="">[30]</a></sup> In his <a href="/wiki/September_25" id="w">September 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>, affidavit private investigator George Newman describes that under interrogation Chobert had recanted the aspect of his testimony that his taxi had been parked directly behind Faulkner&#39;s police car as well as the assertion that he had witnessed a person firing bullets into the body of Faulkner as the latter lay prone on the ground.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cynthia White testified to witnessing the shootings from a nearby corner. Describing Abu-Jamal&#39;s actions, she said: &#34;he was running out of the parking lot and he was practically on the curb when he shot two times at the police officer. It was the back. The police officer turned around and staggered and seemed like he was grabbing for something. Then he fell. Then he came over and he came on top of the police officer and shot some more times. After that he went over and he slouched down and he sat on the curb.&#34;<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Dessie Hightower has stated that he observed her to be at least half a block further away.<sup id="_ref-MAJCRD_DVD_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MAJCRD_DVD" title="">[33]</a></sup> Prostitute Veronica Jones said later that she had been offered favorable treatment by police on condition that she corroborate Cynthia White.<sup id="_ref-MAJCRD_DVD_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MAJCRD_DVD" title="">[33]</a></sup> In her declaration of <a href="/wiki/January_28" id="w">January 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, Yvette Williams affirmed to having been incarcerated with White in December 1981 and being told by her that she had not even seen who shot Faulkner and that she had entirely fabricated a witness account identifying Abu-Jamal out of fear of the Philadelphia police.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Police informant <a href="/wiki/Pamela_Jenkins_(informant)" id="w">Pamela Jenkins</a> testified at a post-conviction relief hearing on <a href="/wiki/June_26" id="w">June 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>, that she had been pressured by Philadelphia police offers to falsely state that she had witnessed the killing of Faulkner and to falsely identify Abu-Jamal as the murderer. She also testified that she knew White to be in fear of her life from police in the period after the shooting of Faulkner and before the trial of Abu-Jamal, and that she had tracked down and discovered Ms White in the company of some Philadelphia police as recently as March 1997.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> However, the prosecution produced Cynthia White&#39;s death certificate showing that she had died in 1992.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Scanlan testified that he saw Faulkner assaulted in front of his police car shortly before another man ran across the street from a parking lot and shot Faulkner. Scanlan was not able to identify the shooter. Under cross-examination, which was interrupted by Abu-Jamal being removed from the courtroom for disruption, Scanlan admitted to being mildly under the influence of alcohol and was unable to describe in detail the appearance of the assailant.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Magilton testified to witnessing Faulkner pull over Cook&#39;s car and that at the point of seeing Abu-Jamal start to cross the street toward them from the parking lot he turned away and lost sight of what happened next until he heard gun shots. He did not see any shooting, or Chobert&#39;s vehicle parked behind Faulkner&#39;s.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Hospital_confession" name="Hospital_confession"></a><h4>Hospital confession</h4>
<p>The prosecution presented two witnesses, security officer Priscilla Durham and Police Officer Garry Bell, who testified that while Abu-Jamal was at hospital, he acknowledged that he shot Faulkner by once or even twice proclaiming, &#34;I shot the mother fucker, and I hope the mother fucker dies.&#34;<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> The hospital doctors are recorded as having said that Abu-Jamal was not capable of making such a statement during the time that he was reported to have uttered it.<sup id="_ref-guardian_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardian" title="">[5]</a></sup> The original report of Gary Wakshul, a police officer who accompanied Abu-Jamal to and at the hospital, relates that &#34;the negro male made no comments&#34;.<sup id="_ref-amn_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amn" title="">[2]</a></sup> Wakshul later claimed to recall hearing Abu-Jamal&#39;s alleged confession on the night of the killing, over two months after the arrest when interviewed by police Internal Affairs officers. He blamed &#34;emotional trauma&#34; for the delay.<sup id="_ref-amn_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amn" title="">[2]</a></sup> Judge <a href="/wiki/Albert_F._Sabo" id="w">Albert F. Sabo</a> did not permit the trial jury to receive Wakshul&#39;s report as evidence.<sup id="_ref-amn_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amn" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Physical_evidence" name="Physical_evidence"></a><h4>Physical evidence</h4>
<p>A .38 caliber <a href="/wiki/Charter_Arms" id="w">Charter Arms</a> revolver registered to Abu-Jamal was found at the scene next to him with 5 spent shell casings.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Tests performed with the available physical evidence verify that Faulkner was killed by a .38 caliber bullet. The extracted slugs were identified as <a href="/wiki/Federal_Cartridge" id="w">Federal brand</a> <a href="/wiki/.38_Special" id="w">.38 Special</a> <a href="/wiki/+P" id="w">+P</a> bullets with hollow bases, which matched the shell casings in Abu-Jamal&#39;s handgun retrieved at the scene. The hollow base in a +P bullet is distinguishable from Federal ammunition otherwise used at that time.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Charter Arms is known for rifling the barrels of their revolvers with eight lands and grooves in a right-hand direction of twist—characteristics also evident on the bullet fragments extracted from Faulkner&#39;s body. Anthony L. Paul, Supervisor of the Firearms Identification Unit, testified at trial that the type of bullet was rare at the time, with only one manufacturer, though he could name two other manufacturers &#34;right off the bat&#34; which produce weapons bearing the same rifling characteristics of pattern and twist direction.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> Experts testified that the bullet taken from Abu-Jamal had been fired from Faulkner&#39;s service weapon. George Fassnacht, a ballistics expert proferred by the defense, did not dispute any of the findings of the prosecution&#39;s weapons and ballistics experts.<sup id="_ref-yn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-yn" title="">[43]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Amnesty_International" id="w">Amnesty International</a>, with reference to the physical evidence, has expressed the view that &#34;…the police failed to conduct tests to ascertain whether the weapon had been fired in the immediate past…Compounding this error, the police also failed to conduct chemical tests on Abu-Jamal&#39;s hands to find out if he had fired a gun recently.&#34;<sup id="_ref-amn_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amn" title="">[2]</a></sup> In a 1995 hearing, a defense ballistics expert testified that due to Abu-Jamal&#39;s struggle with the police during his arrest, such a test would have been difficult to accomplish and, due to the gunpowder residue possibly being shaken or rubbed off, would not have been scientifically reliable.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> A note written by coroner Dr. Paul Hoyer, who <a href="/wiki/Autopsy" id="w">autopsied</a> Daniel Faulkner, states that he extracted a <a href="/wiki/.44_Magnum" id="w">.44 caliber</a> bullet from Faulkner. This has led to claims that Faulkner was shot by a .44 caliber rather than a .38 caliber weapon. Hoyer admitted in 1995 that his note had been a &#34;lay guess&#34; based on his own observations, that he was not a firearms expert and that he had not received any training in weapons ballistics.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Defense_case" name="Defense_case"></a><h3>Defense case</h3>
<p>The defense presented evidence, from witness Dessie Hightower, describing a man running along the street shortly after the shooting.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> This became known as the &#34;running man theory&#34;, based on the possibility that a &#34;running man&#34; may have been the actual shooter. Another witness, Veronica Jones, said &#34;All I seen was two men and a policeman on the ground and what else can I say? I was kind of intoxicated.&#34; In reply to the question, &#34;Did you see anyone running away from the scene?&#34; She replied, &#34;I didn&#39;t see anyone do nothing. No one moved.&#34;<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> The defense claimed to have a third witness, Deborah Kordansky, but she refused to appear in court.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> Of the witnesses, only Chobert testified that shortly after the shooting he had told police that he had seen Abu-Jamal shoot Faulkner in the face, and that Abu-Jamal had then run a short distance and collapsed on the sidewalk after being shot by Faulkner.<sup id="_ref-chobert_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chobert" title="">[30]</a></sup> None of the other witnesses claimed that the running man, or men, were involved in the shooting.<sup id="_ref-tr_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tr" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>The defense presented nine <a href="/wiki/Character_witness#Criminal trials" id="w">character witnesses</a> including poet <a href="/wiki/Sonia_Sanchez" id="w">Sonia Sanchez</a>. Sanchez testified that Abu-Jamal was &#34;viewed by the black community as a creative, articulate, peaceful, genial man.&#34;<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> During cross examination the prosecution raised the issue of her association with convicted felon and Black Panther activist <a href="/wiki/Assata_Shakur" id="w">Joanne Chesimard</a>; Sanchez was also asked over defense objections whether she supported other blacks who had killed police.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Witnesses_not_called_at_trial" name="Witnesses_not_called_at_trial"></a><h3>Witnesses not called at trial</h3>
<p>Abu-Jamal did not testify in his own defense. Regarding this he has explained:<sup id="_ref-mum_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mum" title="">[51]</a></sup></p><blockquote>&#34;At my trial I was denied the right to defend myself. I had no confidence in my court-appointed attorney, who never even asked me what happened the night I was shot and the police officer was killed; and I was excluded from at least half the trial…Since I was denied all my rights at my trial I did not testify.

He claims to have no memory of the events between being shot by Faulkner and the arrival of officers at the scene and to have been abused by the police while he was still in need of medical assistance for his wound.
