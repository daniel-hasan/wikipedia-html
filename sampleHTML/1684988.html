The <b>funeral of <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II" id="w">Pope John Paul II</a></b> was held on <a href="/wiki/April_8" id="w">April 8</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, six days after his death on <a href="/wiki/April_2" id="w">April 2</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Funeral" id="w">funeral</a> was followed by the <i>novemdiales</i> devotional in which the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic Church</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Churches" id="w">Eastern Catholic Churches</a> observe nine days of <a href="/wiki/Mourning" id="w">mourning</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_22" id="w">February 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a>, Pope John Paul II introduced revisions to the centuries-old ceremonies surrounding papal death, repose and burial. The revisions enacted through the apostolic constitution <i><a href="/wiki/Universi_Dominici_Gregis" id="w">Universi Dominici Gregis</a></i> applied to his own <a href="/wiki/Funeral" id="w">funeral</a>.</p>
<p>Pope John Paul&#39;s funeral brought together the single largest gathering of heads of state in history, surpassing the funeral of <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill" id="w">Winston Churchill</a>.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the funeral in <a href="/wiki/Vatican_City" id="w">Vatican City</a>, <a href="/wiki/Archbishop" id="w">archbishops</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bishop" id="w">bishops</a> at <a href="/wiki/Cathedral" id="w">cathedrals</a> throughout the world celebrated memorial <a href="/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)" id="w">Masses</a> for grieving <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Catholics</a>.</p>
<p>In a historical rarity, <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" id="w">Protestant</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodoxy" id="w">Eastern Orthodox</a> <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christian</a> leaders, as well as leaders in <a href="/wiki/Judaism" id="w">Judaism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Islam" id="w">Islam</a>, offered memorials and prayers of their own for their congregants sharing in the grief of Catholics. <a href="/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch" id="w">Ecumenical Patriarch</a> <a href="/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch_Bartholomew_I_of_Constantinople" id="w">Bartholomew I</a> attended the funeral from the honorary first seat; this was the first time an Ecumenical Patriarch attended a papal funeral since the <a href="/wiki/East-West_Schism" id="w">Great Schism</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury" id="w">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> was present at the papal funeral for the first time since the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" id="w">Church of England</a> broke with the papacy in the 16th century. For the first time ever, the head of the <a href="/wiki/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahido_Church" id="w">Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church</a>, Patriarch <a href="/wiki/Abune_Paulos" id="w">Abune Paulos</a> attended the Papal funeral.</p>
<p>It is thought that billions of people had watched the funeral either through actually being in Vatican Square, watching it on television live, or watching a taped version or replayed version later that day. The latter may be particularly true in the United States, where the funeral happened early in the morning and on a weekday. It is unknown whether the funeral of the pope was the most watched event in history; if so, it would overtake another funeral to hold that spot, that one being the funeral of <a href="/wiki/Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales" id="w">Diana, Princess of Wales</a>.</p>
<a id="Rite_of_papal_death" name="Rite_of_papal_death"></a><h2>Rite of papal death</h2>
<p>Centuries of sacred rituals are set in motion upon the death of a pope. Such rituals are administered by the <a href="/wiki/Camerlengo" id="w">Cardinal Camerlengo</a>.</p>
<p>When Pope John Paul II died, the Camerlengo <a href="/wiki/Eduardo_Cardinal_Mart%C3%ADnez_Somalo" id="w">Eduardo Cardinal Martínez Somalo</a> removed the Pope&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ring_of_the_Fisherman" id="w">Ring of the Fisherman</a> from his finger. The Cardinal then ceremonially crushed the ring with the ceremonial silver <a href="/wiki/Hammer" id="w">hammer</a> in the presence of members of the <a href="/wiki/College_of_Cardinals" id="w">College of Cardinals</a>. <a class="externallink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4451483.stm" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4451483.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4451483.stm</a> This is done to prevent the creation of forged, backdated documents, which would appear to have been approved by John Paul II.</p>
<p>After the ring&#39;s destruction, Cardinal Martínez Somalo cordoned off and placed <a href="/wiki/Sealing_wax" id="w">wax seals</a> on the entrances to the Pope&#39;s private bedroom and study. This tradition originates from ruthless cardinals looting the papal chambers upon the death of past popes.</p>
<p>The Pope&#39;s formal death certificate was signed by Dr. Renato Buzzonetti, Director of the Department of Health and Sanitation of Vatican City, on the evening of his death. Cardinal Martínez Somalo then ceremonially ordered the <a href="/wiki/Dean_of_the_College_of_Cardinals" id="w">Dean of the College of Cardinals</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI" id="w">Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger</a>, to summon the cardinals of the world to Vatican City to <a href="/wiki/Papal_conclave%2C_2005" id="w">elect a new pope</a>.</p>
<p>Some traditions were omitted, partly as a result of changes made by Pope John Paul II to the formula of rituals upon the death of a pope. One of these would have required Cardinal Martínez Somalo to tap the head of the pope with the ceremonial silver hammer, a practice that is believed to have ended some time ago under the pontificate of John XXIII. It remains customary for the camerlengo to call out the pope&#39;s Christian name three times, to ensure he has truly died.</p>
<p>While his predecessors had been <a href="/wiki/Embalming" id="w">embalmed</a> after death, the Vatican claimed that Pope John Paul II was not embalmed and lay in state without normal treatment for preservation, which is evident by the grey colour taken on by the body. Also, it was customary for popes to have their organs removed after death. <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_X" id="w">Pope Saint Pius X</a> ended this practice during his reign, and it appears that the wish of some Poles that John Paul II&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Heart" id="w">heart</a> be buried in <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Poland</a> was not obliged.</p>
<a id="Vestments" name="Vestments"></a><h2>Vestments</h2>
<p>Pope John Paul II&#39;s body was clothed in the familiar white <a href="/wiki/Cassock" id="w">soutane</a>, over which was placed a plain white <a href="/wiki/Alb" id="w">alb</a>. A <a href="/wiki/Stole" id="w">stole</a>, the symbol of ordained ministry, was placed around his neck. Over the inner vestments, Pope John Paul II was clothed in a red <a href="/wiki/Chasuble" id="w">chasuble</a>. An ancient Byzantine custom, red is the old colour of mourning for Popes. Around his collar, the <a href="/wiki/Pallium" id="w">pallium</a> of white lamb&#39;s wool was draped. A white <a href="/wiki/Zucchetto" id="w">zucchetto</a> and a white bishop&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Mitre" id="w">mitre</a> adorned Pope John Paul II&#39;s head. In his arm rested <a href="/wiki/Paul_VI" id="w">Paul VI</a>&#39;s famous pastoral cross-staff, used by popes in place of the <a href="/wiki/Crosier" id="w">crosier</a>. His hands clasped a <a href="/wiki/Rosary" id="w">rosary</a>.</p>
<p>At first, he lay in state in his favorite pair of Polish-made brown leather shoes, an American size ten and a half, which he wore on his travels throughout the world. Later, following the example of his immediate predecessors, these were changed to plain red leather <a href="/wiki/Papal_shoes" id="w">papal shoes</a>.</p>
<a id="Mass_of_Repose" name="Mass_of_Repose"></a><h2>Mass of Repose</h2>
<p>A first Mass of Repose, offered to anyone <a href="/wiki/Baptism" id="w">baptized</a> in the Catholic Church, was led by <a href="/wiki/Angelo_Cardinal_Sodano" id="w">Angelo Cardinal Sodano</a> on <a href="/wiki/April_3" id="w">April 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>. That Sunday service coincided with the celebration of the Feast of Divine Mercy, a memorial feast instituted by Pope John Paul II.</p>
<p>The Mass of Repose, commemorating the sending of the soul to <a href="/wiki/God" id="w">God</a>, was followed by the recitation of the <a href="/wiki/Regina_Coeli" id="w">Regina Coeli</a>.</p>

The body of Pope John Paul II was dressed in his vestments and moved to the <a href="/wiki/Clementine_Hall" id="w">Clementine Hall</a> on the third level considered the second floor of the <a href="/wiki/Apostolic_Palace" id="w">Apostolic Palace</a> on <a href="/wiki/April_3" id="w">April 3</a>.

Near the bed was a wooden <a href="/wiki/Crucifix" id="w">crucifix</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Paschal_candle" id="w">paschal candle</a> symbolic of <a href="/wiki/Jesus" id="w">Jesus Christ</a> as the light of the world in the face of darkness and death. His body was guarded by the <a href="/wiki/Swiss_Guard" id="w">Swiss Guard</a>, a corps of men which has sworn to protect the pope through several centuries. During a period of private visitation Vatican officials and a contingent of officials from the Italian government viewed the body of Pope John Paul II.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_4" id="w">April 4</a>, the body of Pope John Paul II was moved onto a red <a href="/wiki/Velvet" id="w">velvet</a> bier, propped on three red pillows. The <a href="/wiki/Papal_Gentlemen" id="w">Papal Gentlemen</a>, regaled in black <a href="/wiki/Morning_coat" id="w">morning coats</a> and white gloves, were chosen as <a href="/wiki/Pallbearer" id="w">pallbearers</a> and stood along the sides of the pope&#39;s bier.

A long procession was begun in order to transfer the body of Pope John Paul II from the Clementine Hall, through the colonnades of the Apostolic Palace and into <a href="/wiki/St._Peter%26%2339%3Bs_Square" id="w">St. Peter&#39;s Square</a> among the waiting people. Traditionally, the pope&#39;s body is then brought to either <a href="/wiki/St._Peter%26%2339%3Bs_Basilica" id="w">St. Peter&#39;s Basilica</a> or the papal cathedral, <a href="/wiki/Basilica_di_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano" id="w">St. John Lateran Basilica</a>. A procession of monks, priests and bishops paced slowly along a route towards St. Peter&#39;s Basilica. The College of Cardinals trailed by Cardinal Ratzinger and  Cardinal Martínez Somalo followed them.</p>
<p>As the ritual dating back to the <a href="/wiki/Medieval" id="w">medieval</a> era proceeded, <a href="/wiki/Gregorian_chant" id="w">Gregorian chants</a> were sung by several religious orders with the people responding to each verse with the ancient <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> prayer, &#34;Lord, have mercy&#34; or &#34;<a href="/wiki/Kyrie" id="w">Kyrie eleison</a>.&#34; The <a href="/wiki/Litany_of_the_Saints" id="w">Litany of the Saints</a> was sung. After each name of a <a href="/wiki/Martyr" id="w">martyr</a> or <a href="/wiki/Saint" id="w">saint</a> was chanted, invoking his or her intercession between God and the people, participants in the procession sang the <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> words, &#34;Ora pro eo,&#34; meaning &#34;Pray for him.&#34; This is a departure from the traditional, &#34;Pray for us&#34; or &#34;Ora pro nobis.&#34;</p>
<p>When the body of the pope was hoisted upon the steps of St. Peter&#39;s Basilica, the Papal Gentlemen turned the bier and lifted the pope&#39;s head to face the tens of thousands of people that filled St. Peter&#39;s Square.  Cardinal Martínez Somalo noted it as the pope&#39;s symbolic last look at the devoted followers that had filled St. Peter&#39;s Square throughout the papacy of John Paul II.</p>
<p>The procession ended with the seating of the <a href="/wiki/College_of_Cardinals" id="w">College of Cardinals</a> and the placement of the bier carrying the body of John Paul on a catafalque in front of the steps leading to the altar of St. Peter&#39;s Basilica. The paschal candle was lit and the body of the Pope was incensed again by Cardinal Martínez Somalo. Prayers were said and a reading from the <a href="/wiki/Gospel" id="w">Gospels</a> was performed by a <a href="/wiki/Deacon" id="w">deacon</a>. After the College of Cardinals paid their respects and left the sanctuary, the basilica was closed and then reopened for the official <a href="/wiki/Lying_in_state" id="w">lying in state</a> to last until the day of the Mass of Requiem and subsequent interment.</p>

Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, later <a href="/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI" id="w">Pope Benedict XVI</a> led the <a href="/wiki/Requiem" id="w">Mass of Requiem</a> on <a href="/wiki/April_8" id="w">April 8</a> at 10:00 a.m. <a href="/wiki/CEST" id="w">CEST</a> (08:00 <a href="/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time" id="w">UTC</a>), by virtue of his office as Dean of the College of Cardinals. He was also one of Pope John Paul II&#39;s closest friends and carried out most of the Pope&#39;s duties during his final illness. Concelebrating in the Mass of Requiem were the College of Cardinals (the number of members were present has been variously given as 157 and 164) and the <a href="/wiki/Patriarch" id="w">patriarchs</a> of the Eastern Catholic Churches.</p>
<p>As the pope must be buried between the fourth and sixth day after his death, Friday was chosen as the last possible date. The Mass at St. Peter&#39;s Basilica was the first Mass of Requiem for a pope to be televised live in almost every nation in the world.</p>
<p>The event had an estimated viewership of over 2 billion people; the Catholic Church claims only 1.1 billion among its members. The funeral of John Paul II was by far the largest funeral in the history of the world. In lieu of a public viewing at the Basilica of St. John Lateran, as was tradition, immense digital screens instead broadcast the Mass of Requiem and subsequent Rite of Interment to people in the pope&#39;s cathedral church outside the confines of Vatican City. The same digital screens were hoisted at several sites in Rome, including the <a href="/wiki/Circus_Maximus" id="w">Circus Maximus</a>, and at specially designated campsites outside the city for the millions of pilgrims who descended on the city.</p>
<p>The funeral was perhaps the most-watched live event in the history of television. People in the United States understood that the service took place during the early morning hours on their side of the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic</a>. Many people awoke in order to view the funeral, and others taped it for a historical record. In addition, several television networks in the Americas rebroadcast the funeral later in the day.</p>

As the Mass of Requiem began, the doors of St. Peter&#39;s Basilica were locked with dignitaries asked to stand outside the church. Only the College of Cardinals and the patriarchs of the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Churches" id="w">Eastern Catholic Churches</a> were allowed inside for a private ceremony in which John Paul was placed in a cypress coffin, the first of three. Before being laid in the coffin, Archbishop <a href="/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Dziwisz" id="w">Stanisław Dziwisz</a> had the honour of placing a white silk veil over the face of the pope - his last official act of service to the pope as his papal secretary. The body was lowered into a cypress coffin, which served as the innermost coffin. Along with the body was a sealed document, the Rogito, a <a href="/wiki/Eulogy" id="w">eulogy</a> detailing the life and works of Pope John Paul II, read by Archbishop Marini and signed by those present during the funeral. Three bags containing gold, silver, and copper coins were placed beside the body. Each bag contained one coin for each year in Pope John Paul II&#39;s reign, the only monetary compensation he received for his service as pope. After the private ceremony, the doors of St. Peter&#39;s Basilica were opened while dignitaries were seated. Cardinal Ratzinger and his concelebrants prepared for their procession from inside the basilica to a marble apron in the middle of St. Peter&#39;s Square where the Mass of Requiem was held.</p>
<p>The procession began with the introductory chant, &#34;Requiem Aeternam&#34; (&#34;Eternal Rest Grant Him, O Lord&#34;), which includes verses from <a href="/wiki/Psalms" id="w">Psalm</a> 64 (65), &#34;To You We Owe Our Hymn of Praise, O God of Zion.&#34; Carried on the shoulders of the Papal Gentlemen, the coffin bearing the image of Pope John Paul II&#39;s coat-of-arms burned onto the lid, the pope was carried into St. Peter&#39;s Square onto the marble apron. An acolyte holding a red leather-bound <a href="/wiki/Book_of_the_Gospel" id="w">Book of the Gospel</a> led the coffin. The Papal Gentlemen laid the coffin onto a red carpet directly in front of the altar.</p>

After being blessed by Cardinal Ratzinger, an <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> deacon of the <a href="/wiki/Archdiocese_of_Birmingham" id="w">Archdiocese of Birmingham</a>, Paul Moss (who has now been ordained priest), processed with the Book of the Gospels to the <a href="/wiki/Ambo" id="w">ambo</a> or <a href="/wiki/Lectern" id="w">lectern</a>. He began by singing, &#34;The Gospel according to John.&#34; Congregants replied, &#34;Glory to you, O Lord.&#34; Moss then incensed the Book of the Gospel and then sang the reading in <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a>. The reading came from <a href="/wiki/Gospel_of_John" id="w">John</a> chapter 6, verse 40, stating, &#34;For this is the will of my father that everyone who sees the son and believes in him may have eternal life.&#34; Moss then read from <a href="/wiki/John_21:15-19" id="w">John chapter 21, verses 15 through 19</a>, which is an account of a dialogue between <a href="/wiki/Jesus" id="w">Jesus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saint_Peter" id="w">Saint Peter</a>. Jesus asked three times, &#34;Do you love me?&#34; He then told his disciple, &#34;Follow me.&#34; The deacon raised the Book of the Gospel and sang, &#34;Verbum Domini&#34; or &#34;The Word of the Lord.&#34; Congregants replied in chant, &#34;Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.&#34;</p>
<a id="Homily" name="Homily"></a><h3>Homily</h3>
<p>After kissing the text of the Book of the Gospels, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI" id="w">Cardinal Ratzinger</a> stood before the congregants to offer his homily, similar to a sermon in the Protestant denominations, which included references to the life and service of Pope John Paul. He spoke in <a href="/wiki/Italian_language" id="w">Italian</a>, first greeting the many political figures and religious leaders that had gathered, and then told the story of how the young Karol had answered the Lord&#39;s call, and became a priest after the persecution of the Nazis, the answer of the command: &#34;Follow me!&#34; Cardinal Ratzinger also told of John Paul&#39;s life as a bishop, cardinal, and pope, frequently applying <a href="/wiki/Scripture" id="w">scripture</a> to the pope&#39;s life. Finally, he told of the pope&#39;s devotion to <a href="/wiki/Blessed_Virgin_Mary" id="w">Mary</a> and the Divine Mercy of Christ. The cardinal&#39;s last words were about the final hours of Pope John Paul II:</p>
<dl><dd>None of us can ever forget how in that last Easter Sunday of his life, the Holy Father, marked by suffering, came once more to the window of the Apostolic Palace and one last time gave his blessing <i><a href="/wiki/Urbi_et_Orbi" id="w">Urbi et Orbi</a></i>. We can be sure that our beloved pope is standing today at the window of the Father&#39;s house that he sees us and blesses us. Yes, bless us, Holy Father. We entrust your dear soul to the Mother of God, your Mother, who guided you each day and who will guide you now to the eternal glory of her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.</dd></dl>
<p>Some construed the ending of the homily to mean that the pope had already entered into <a href="/wiki/Heaven" id="w">heaven</a>, and had become a <a href="/wiki/Saint" id="w">saint</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/international/worldspecial2/13saintcnd.html?hp&#38;ex=1113364800&#38;en=d6e61bcccdb2b7bb&#38;ei=5094&#38;partner=homepage" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/international/worldspecial2/13saintcnd.html?hp&#38;ex=1113364800&#38;en=d6e61bcccdb2b7bb&#38;ei=5094&#38;partner=homepage">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/international/worldspecial2/13saintcnd.html?hp&#38;ex=1113364800&#38;en=d6e61bcccdb2b7bb&#38;ei=5094&#38;partner=homepage</a>.</p>
<p>Cardinal Ratzinger became emotional at certain parts of his homily, especially in reflection of the inability of Pope John Paul to speak in the last days of his life. Altogether, the homily was interrupted approximately ten times with outbursts of applause by the congregants.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Apostles%26%2339%3B_Creed" id="w">Apostles&#39; Creed</a> sung in the Latin language followed the homily. The prayers of the faithful were offered in <a href="/wiki/Italian_language" id="w">Italian</a>, <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>, <a href="/wiki/Swahili_language" id="w">Swahili</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tagalog_language" id="w">Tagalog</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polish_language" id="w">Polish</a>, <a href="/wiki/German_language" id="w">German</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_language" id="w">Portuguese</a>.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Borne on the shoulders of the Papal Gentlemen, the coffin of Pope John Paul II is taken from the altar for the Rite of Interment.</div></div>

The part of the Mass of Requiem called the Liturgy of the <a href="/wiki/Eucharist#Roman Catholic Eucharistic theology" id="w">Eucharist</a> began. Cardinal Ratzinger and the concelebrating cardinals gathered around the altar to consecrate the bread and wine. Catholics believe that at the Consecration of the Mass (when the priest says &#34;This is my body&#34; and &#34;This is my blood&#34;), the substance of the bread and wine is changed into that of Jesus Christ. This change is called <a href="/wiki/Transubstantiation" id="w">transubstantiation</a>. Because the Church believes the Eucharist is really and truly Christ Himself under the appearances of bread and wine, Catholics worship Jesus in the Eucharist.</p>
<p>After the Eucharistic Prayer (the point in the Mass during which the Consecration occurs), the <a href="/wiki/Lord%26%2339%3Bs_Prayer" id="w">Lord&#39;s Prayer</a> was sung followed later by the brief Latin litany, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Agnus_Dei" id="w">Agnus Dei</a>&#34;. The Eucharist was then taken to the congregants in St. Peter&#39;s Square to be distributed among the faithful. As the congregation received the Blessed Sacrament, Psalm 129 (in some Biblical versions Psalm 130) was sung. Its lyrics proclaimed, &#34;Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord; Lord, hear my voice.&#34;</p>
<p>After the Liturgy of the Eucharist, the crowds in the streets of Vatican City burst into applause, waving flags and banners chanting, &#34;Santo Subito!&#34; which means &#34;Saint now!&#34; and &#34;Giovanni Paolo Santo&#34; or &#34;Saint John Paul!&#34;. A few also repeatedly chanted &#34;Magnus&#34; or &#34;Great&#34;, spontaneously declaring that he should be John Paul <a href="/wiki/List_of_people_known_as_The_Great" id="w">the Great</a>.</p>
<a id="Commendation" name="Commendation"></a><h3>Commendation</h3>
<p>After the congregants received <a href="/wiki/Eucharist_(Catholic_Church)" id="w">communion</a>, Cardinal Ratzinger led the Rite of Final Commendation and Farewell. He asked the College of Cardinals and patriarchs of the Eastern Rite to converge on the casket of Pope John Paul II. The congregants were called to prayer, &#34;Dear brothers and sisters let us entrust to the most gentle mercy of God, the soul of our Pope John Paul II.&#34; He continued, &#34;May the Blessed Virgin Mary... intercede with God so that he might show the face of his blessed Son to our Pope, and console the church with the light of the resurrection.&#34;</p>
<p>The choir sang the <a href="/wiki/Litany_of_the_Saints" id="w">Litany of the Saints</a>; the same song was sung during the procession that transferred the body of Pope John Paul II from the Clementine Hall of the Apostolic Palace to St. Peter&#39;s Basilica. Breaking with tradition for the sacred prayer, the names of the <a href="/wiki/List_of_saints_canonised_by_Pope_John_Paul_II" id="w">saints canonised by Pope John Paul II</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Mary_Faustina_Kowalska" id="w">Faustina Kowalska</a> and <a href="/wiki/Josemar%C3%ADa_Escriv%C3%A1" id="w">Josemaría Escrivá</a>, were allowed to be included in the song. Names of saints included in the more traditional litany were also included along with the newer saints.</p>
<p>After the singing of the Litany of the Saints, the <a href="/wiki/Patriarchs" id="w">patriarchs</a>, archbishops and metropolitans of the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Churches" id="w">Eastern Catholic Churches</a> approached the coffin of Pope John Paul II for their own rituals of commendation and farewell. They incensed the casket and led each other into prayer, chanting the Easter proclamation &#34;Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by His death.&#34; The Eastern patriarchs together with the entire College of Cardinals witnessed the sprinkling of the casket with the waters used in the sacrament of baptism. Incense was used once again, when Ratzinger, helped by an Italian deacon of the Pontifical Major Seminary in Rome, father Nello Luongo, incensed and prayed for the dead Pope at the very end of the Mass. The Prayer of the Eastern Churches from the Office of the Dead of the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" id="w">Byzantine</a> Liturgy was sung in <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> and in Arabic, ending with &#34;Your memory is eternal, our brother, dignified with blessings and unforgettable.&#34;</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Requiem" id="w">Mass of Requiem</a> was officially ended with congregants standing, singing the words, &#34;May the angels accompany you into heaven, may the martyrs welcome you when you arrive, and lead you to Holy <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" id="w">Jerusalem</a>.&#34;</p>
<p>The Papal Gentlemen carried the coffin of Pope John Paul II for interment. As they carried the Pope toward the entrance of St. Peter&#39;s, the congregation in attendance broke out into applause and cheered as their final farewell. The coffin was then turned 180 degrees to face the congregation and the cameras, and the crowd applauded and cheered with more fervor before it was taken out of the public view for the last time. Cardinal Ratzinger handed over authority of the Rite of Interment to Cardinal Martínez Somalo, the <a href="/wiki/Camerlengo" id="w">Camerlengo</a>.</p>
<a id="Rite_of_Interment" name="Rite_of_Interment"></a><h2>Rite of Interment</h2>
<p>The people of <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Poland</a> had wished for the <a href="/wiki/Heart" id="w">heart</a> of Pope John Paul II to be removed from his body and transferred to <a href="/wiki/Wawel" id="w">Wawel Cathedral</a> to be buried alongside the greatest of Poland&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Monarch" id="w">monarchs</a>. Martínez Cardinal Somalo said that the request would not be obliged.</p>
<p>An underground <a href="/wiki/Grotto" id="w">grotto</a> beside the former <a href="/wiki/Shrine" id="w">shrine</a> of the now glass-entombed and preserved body of Blessed <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_XXIII" id="w">Pope John XXIII</a> was chosen for the interment of Pope John Paul II.  He was lowered into a tomb that had been prepared following the transfer of Blessed Pope John XXIII&#39;s remains from the grotto to the main floor of the basilica after his <a href="/wiki/Beatification" id="w">beatification</a>.  The vault that originally held John XXIII&#39;s body had been removed so a new tomb could be built.  The College of Cardinals decided to keep John Paul II beneath the altar of St. Peter&#39;s Basilica, citing the possibility of future beatification and <a href="/wiki/Canonization" id="w">canonization</a> into <a href="/wiki/Sainthood" id="w">sainthood</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Pallbearer" id="w">Pallbearers</a> took the coffin through the central door of St. Peter&#39;s Basilica. At that point a single bell tolled. The pallbearers took the coffin through the Santa Marta Door, under the Monument to Alexander VII, to the outside (South) of the Basilica. They entered the grottoes, a cemetery underneath the Basilica where <a href="/wiki/Saint_Peter" id="w">Saint Peter</a> is believed to be buried, through the door now used as the grottoes exit. After pacing through the low ceilings and long corridors, the pallbearers stopped at the crypt of Pope John Paul II.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Pope John Paul II was buried in this simple underground crypt according to his wishes</div></div>

Martínez Cardinal Somalo, Camerlengo of the Roman Church, then presided over the Rite of Interment. It was a private service witnessed only by the highest-ranking members of the College of Cardinals.
As is custom, Pope John Paul II was entombed in three nested coffins. The cypress coffin was sealed and tied with three red silk ribbons. <a class="externallink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4424477.stm" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4424477.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4424477.stm</a>
The cypress casket was lowered into a larger solid <a href="/wiki/Zinc" id="w">zinc</a> (traditionally <a href="/wiki/Lead" id="w">lead</a>) casket, which was <a href="/wiki/Soldering" id="w">soldered</a> shut. This coffin was adorned with three <a href="/wiki/Bronze" id="w">bronze</a> plaques: a simple cross at the head of the coffin, a middle plaque with the Pope&#39;s name and the length of his life and pontificate, and a third with Pope John Paul II&#39;s personal coat of arms at the foot. The zinc casket was finally lowered into a larger <a href="/wiki/Walnut" id="w">walnut</a> (traditionally <a href="/wiki/Elm" id="w">elm</a>) casket, bearing three identical plaques, which was shut with nails of pure <a href="/wiki/Gold" id="w">gold</a>. The middle plaques bear the following statement in Latin:<br/>
<center>CORPUS IOANNIS PAULI II P.M.<br/>
VIXIT ANNOS LXXXIV MENSES X DIES XV<br/>
ECCLESIAE UNIVERSAE PRAEFUIT<br/>
ANNOS XXVI MENSES V DIES XVII</center>
<br/>
<center><i>English Translation:</i><br/>
<i>Body of John Paul II, Supreme Pontiff</i><br/>
<i>He lived 84 years, 10 months, 15 days</i><br/>
<i>He presided over the Universal Church</i><br/>
<i>26 years, 5 months, 17 days</i>
</center></p>
<p>The unified coffin was lowered into the ground, as the Pope requested, and covered with a plain stone slab featuring his name and dates of his pontificate. Pope John Paul II asked that his burial be like that of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Paul_VI" id="w">Pope Paul VI</a>, not in an elaborate <a href="/wiki/Sarcophagus" id="w">sarcophagus</a> and ornate aboveground <a href="/wiki/Tomb" id="w">tomb</a>, but in &#34;bare earth&#34; <a class="externallink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4442523.stm" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4442523.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4442523.stm</a>.</p>
<p>Martínez Cardinal Somalo ended the Rite of Interment with the words, &#34;Lord, grant him eternal rest, and may perpetual light shine upon him.&#34; Those present sang &#34;Salve Regina&#34; or &#34;Hail Holy Queen.&#34;</p>
<a id="Dignitaries" name="Dignitaries"></a><h2>Dignitaries</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Before the College of Cardinals could offer official customary invitations to the various heads of state and government, over 200 foreign officials had expressed their desire to attend the Mass of Requiem. Among the most familiar faces worldwide were the current and former <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">Presidents of the United States</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Chirac" id="w">President of France</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Juan_Carlos_I_of_Spain" id="w">King</a> and <a href="/wiki/Queen_Sof%C3%ADa_of_Spain" id="w">Queen</a> of Spain, the <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair" id="w">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Gerhard_Schr%C3%B6der" id="w">Chancellor of Germany</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales" id="w">Prince of Wales</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada" id="w">Prime Minister of Canada</a> the <a href="/wiki/Abdullah_II_of_Jordan" id="w">King</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rania_Al-Abdullah_of_Jordan" id="w">Queen</a> of <a href="/wiki/Jordan" id="w">Jordan</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Kofi_Annan" id="w">Secretary-General of the United Nations</a>. Also attending were <a href="/wiki/Mohammad_Khatami" id="w">Mohammad Khatami</a> of <a href="/wiki/Iran" id="w">Iran</a> and <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israeli President</a> <a href="/wiki/Moshe_Katsav" id="w">Moshe Katsav</a>.</p>
<p>The dignitaries were seated alphabetically according to the French spelling of their country&#39;s name and arranged according to diplomatic protocol. As such, <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israeli President</a> <a href="/wiki/Moshe_Katsav" id="w">Moshe Katsav</a> sat only two seats away from a traditional enemy of Israel, Khatami of Iran. <a href="/wiki/Zimbabwe" id="w">Zimbabwean</a> President <a href="/wiki/Robert_Mugabe" id="w">Robert Mugabe</a> defied a <a href="/wiki/European_Union" id="w">European Union</a> travel ban to attend the funeral. <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_China" id="w">Taiwanese</a> <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_China" id="w">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Chen_Shui-bian" id="w">Chen Shui-bian</a> made an unprecedented appearance, due to the existence of diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the Republic of China. The People&#39;s Republic of China was not invited to the funeral. Altogether, the Mass of Requiem was deemed to be the largest gathering of statesmen in world history, exceeding the gathering at the <a href="/wiki/State_funeral" id="w">state funeral</a> of <a href="/wiki/Sir_Winston_Churchill" id="w">Sir Winston Churchill</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> in <a href="/wiki/1965" id="w">1965</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the dignitaries who attended the funeral also attended the installation Mass for <a href="/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI" id="w">Pope Benedict XVI</a> on <a href="/wiki/24_April" id="w">24 April</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>.</p>
<a id="Novemdiales" name="Novemdiales"></a><h2>Novemdiales</h2>
<p>After the Rite of Interment, nine official days of mourning began. The <a href="/wiki/Devotional" id="w">devotional</a> called novemdiales features a Mass of Requiem on each of the nine days at St. Peter&#39;s Basilica. Several cardinals were chosen by Cardinal Ratzinger to have the honor of presiding over each Mass. One of the most controversial honorees was <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Francis_Law" id="w">Bernard Francis Law</a>, Cardinal <a href="/wiki/Archpriest" id="w">Archpriest</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Basilica_di_Santa_Maria_Maggiore" id="w">Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore</a>, scheduled to preside a novemdiales on <a href="/wiki/April_11" id="w">April 11</a>. During his tenure as <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Boston" id="w">Archbishop of Boston</a>, Cardinal Law was accused of having mishandled cases of sexual abuse at the hands of diocesan priests. The event sparked the nationwide <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church_sex_abuse_scandal" id="w">Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal</a> in the <a href="/wiki/List_of_the_Roman_Catholic_dioceses_of_the_United_States" id="w">dioceses of the United States</a>.</p>
<p>Several members of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, a grassroots advocacy group also known as SNAP, flew to Rome to protest saying Cardinal Law&#39;s place of honor was painful to sexual abuse victims and embarrassing to Catholics. Just as the group&#39;s members arrived at St. Peter&#39;s Basilica, led by founder Barbara Blaine, police officers escorted them outside the confines of St. Peter&#39;s Square. Blaine was unable to pass out fliers to people walking into the Mass offered by Cardinal Law.</p>
<p>Blaine had earlier told reporters in a press conference, &#34;We are the sons and daughters of the Catholic family who were raped, sodomized and sexually molested by priests. At this time, we should be able to focus on the Holy Father&#39;s death, instead of Cardinal Law&#39;s prominence.&#34; The College of Cardinals responded by stating that Cardinal Law was honored as a matter of his being the ordinary of one of the most important basilicas of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/April_14" id="w">April 14</a> novemdiales Mass at St. Peter&#39;s Basilica replaced traditional hymns and prayers with those of the Maronite Rite, one of the Eastern Catholic Churches. <a href="/wiki/Nasrallah_Pierre_Cardinal_Sfeir" id="w">Nasrallah Pierre Cardinal Sfeir</a>, Patriarch of Antioch of the Maronites, presided over the Mass. It was the first time a cardinal patriarch of an Eastern Catholic Church offered a novemdiales Mass, in his own rite, for a pope.</p>
<a id="Security" name="Security"></a><h2>Security</h2>
<p>The immensity of the pilgrim presence in Rome and the vast diplomatic contingent from nations around the world raised concerns by the <a href="/wiki/College_of_Cardinals" id="w">College of Cardinals</a> that the funeral, conclave and installation of a new pope would make Vatican City a target for <a href="/wiki/Terrorism" id="w">terrorism</a>. The anti-terrorism task forces responsible for securing the funeral considered international terrorists the primary potential threat because of the attending dignitaries; domestic terrorism from Italian political extremists was considered less likely.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_6" id="w">April 6</a>—in advent of the arrival of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> delegation aboard <i><a href="/wiki/Air_Force_One" id="w">Air Force One</a></i>, protected by a military escort—the Italian government issued a <a href="/wiki/No-fly_zone" id="w">no-fly zone</a> within a five-mile radius of Rome. The Italian government considered the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President of the United States</a>, the first sitting American president to attend a papal funeral, as the most tempting target for terrorists. Official diplomatic delegations from other nations began arriving at the same time.</p>
<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Aeronautica_Militare_Italiana" id="w">Aeronautica Militare Italiana</a></i> (Italian air force) prepared their <a href="/wiki/Aircraft" id="w">aircraft</a> to be launched at a moment&#39;s notice in case of a terrorist strike. The <a href="/wiki/Italian_Army" id="w">Italian Army</a> deployed <a href="/wiki/Anti-aircraft" id="w">anti-aircraft</a> <a href="/wiki/Missile" id="w">missiles</a> around Vatican City, to the grudging dismay of the College of Cardinals. <i><a href="/wiki/Marina_Militare" id="w">Marina Militare</a></i> (Italian navy) <a href="/wiki/Warship" id="w">warships</a> were positioned along the shorelines of Italy armed with <a href="/wiki/Torpedo" id="w">torpedoes</a>. <a href="/wiki/Gunboat" id="w">Gunboats</a> ran up and down the <a href="/wiki/River" id="w">rivers</a> and waterways of Rome, including the <a href="/wiki/Tiber" id="w">Tiber River</a> which flows around Vatican City.
One thousand <a href="/wiki/Sniper" id="w">snipers</a> were positioned on strategic rooftops throughout the Italian capital as <a href="/wiki/Carabinieri" id="w">Carabinieri</a> <a href="/wiki/Military_police" id="w">military police</a> task forces swept <a href="/wiki/Aqueduct" id="w">aqueducts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Drain" id="w">drains</a> for <a href="/wiki/Explosive" id="w">explosives</a>. <a href="/wiki/Helicopter" id="w">Helicopters</a> were dispatched to scan the city streets from above.
