<p><b>Hurricane Nina</b> was the final tropical storm and hurricane of the <a href="/wiki/1950-1969_Pacific_hurricane_seasons" id="w">1957 Pacific hurricane season</a> and the last storm to form during the active Central Pacific hurricane season this year. This storm was named &#34;Nina&#34; because during this time, hurricanes in this basin were given names off of the typhoon naming lists. This storm was the last to form during a series of typhoons to form in the Pacific in November.<sup id="_ref-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nina never made landfall while active, although some forecasts called for Nina to be the first hurricane to make landfall on <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" id="w">Hawaii</a>, but the hurricane veered west before hitting land. However, it came close enough to Hawaii to cause light damage and prompt evacuations. Nina was the first hurricane to affect the island of <a href="/wiki/Kauai" id="w">Kauai</a> at that intensity.<sup id="_ref-Syracuse Herald Journal 2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Syracuse Herald Journal 2" title="">[2]</a></sup> This storm was preceded by a winter storm that caused damaging surf along the north coast of Kauai and was both preceded and proceeded by cold fronts sweeping over Hawaii.<sup id="_ref-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Storm_history" name="Storm_history"></a><h2>Storm history</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_29" id="w">November 29</a>, a disturbance in the <a href="/wiki/ITCZ" id="w">ITCZ</a> began gaining organization near <a href="/wiki/Palmyra_Island" id="w">Palmyra Island</a>, which the ITCZ had been near for a week prior. The weather station on the island reported southwestern surface winds of 50 <a href="/wiki/Mph" id="w">mph</a> and a pressure of 1002.7 <a href="/wiki/Bar_(unit)" id="w">mbar</a> and that during the night, the wind velocity peaked at 70 mph. Because of an irregular schedule for reporting, the last report received from the weather station, obtained eighteen hours earlier, had reported only small winds and 1004.7 mb pressure. Most noteworthy about this report was the 3-hour pressure tendency, which reported -3.2 mbar. Post-analysis revealed that this tendency was an indication of tropical cyclone development.<sup id="_ref-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>After receiving the second report on the 29th, warnings were immediately put out on the cyclone, which was given the name &#34;Nina&#34; from the typhoon list. For 24 hours, the center of the storm was reported to be stationary as the weather on Palmyra was continuously abnormal, but the next day, an aircraft from the <a href="/wiki/Air_Force" id="w">Air Force</a> showed that the storm was 500 miles north of the island and that it had intensified to hurricane strength.<sup id="_ref-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957" title="">[1]</a></sup> After six more hours, Nina&#39;s forward speed had quickly slowed 16 mph while the storm began a northward track, heading towards <a href="/wiki/Kauai" id="w">Kauai</a>, but before reaching the island, the storm turned first to the north-northwest on <a href="/wiki/December_2" id="w">December 2</a> and then sharply to the west later that day.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/December_4" id="w">December 4</a>, Nina had reached its peak intensity of 85 mph. At this time, a polar high pressure system moved off of the coast of <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>. The system reached Nina on <a href="/wiki/December_6" id="w">December 6</a> and forced the hurricane into a southward path. Twenty hours after the turn, the cold air from the system got trapped inside the circulation of Nina and caused the storm to rapidly dissipate. The last advisory on the system was issued early on <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a> while Nina was at depression strength south of <a href="/wiki/Midway_Atoll" id="w">Midway Atoll</a>.<sup id="_ref-Weather and Circulation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weather and Circulation" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Preparations" name="Preparations"></a><h2>Preparations</h2>
<p>Despite never moving onto land, Nina&#39;s proximity to <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" id="w">Hawaii</a> and the forecasts for an imminent landfall resulted in massive evacuations. An estimated 300 people living in <a href="/wiki/Hanapepe" id="w">Hanapepe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hanalei" id="w">Hanalei</a> were forced to evacuate when the <a href="/wiki/Hanalei_River" id="w">Hanalei River</a> overflowed its banks.<sup id="_ref-Hayward Daily Review_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hayward Daily Review" title="">[4]</a></sup> An estimated 1,500 people on <a href="/wiki/Kauai" id="w">Kauai</a> were evacuated to higher ground, where the <a href="/wiki/Red_Cross" id="w">Red Cross</a> had established seven evacuation centers for these people to evacuate to.<sup id="_ref-Syracuse Herald Journal 2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Syracuse Herald Journal 2" title="">[2]</a></sup> In addition, thirteen members of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard" id="w">United States Coast Guard</a> were evacuated from low-lying islands and harbors when they were threatened by rising tides triggered by the hurricane and the threat of flooding forced 420 military personnel and families in <a href="/wiki/Waikiki" id="w">Waikiki</a>&#39;s Ft. Derussy and Ft. Armstrong as well as those living in Ft. Kamehameha, near <a href="/wiki/Pearl_Harbor" id="w">Pearl Harbor</a> to leave for higher ground. 270 were housed in Tripler Army Hospital and a temporary shelter was opened in Ft. Shafter, both of which were on high ground.<sup id="_ref-Galveston Daily News_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Galveston Daily News" title="">[5]</a></sup> In anticipation of Nina, 85 planes were flown away from Barber&#39;s Point Naval Air Base to <a href="/wiki/Midway_Atoll" id="w">Midway</a><sup id="_ref-Charleston Gazette_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Charleston Gazette" title="">[6]</a></sup> and several commercial flights were cancelled until the storm had passed. There was also concern for the residents of the privately owned <a href="/wiki/Niihau" id="w">Niihau</a>, the closest landmass to the center of Nina and 20 miles closer than Kauai. The island&#39;s only communications was by boat and most attempts at reaching the island failed due to high surf.<sup id="_ref-Syracuse Herald Journal 2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Syracuse Herald Journal 2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Impact" name="Impact"></a><h2>Impact</h2>
<p>Despite the evacuations, Nina&#39;s closest approach to Hawaii was 120 miles away.<sup id="_ref-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957" title="">[1]</a></sup> However, it came close enough to bring winds and heavy rain to the islands. There were four deaths reported in connection to the storm. The first reported was on <a href="/wiki/Oahu" id="w">Oahu</a> when Herman Palepana, a <a href="/wiki/Lineman" id="w">lineman</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Honolulu" id="w">Honolulu</a> street department, got killed when he was electrocuted by a <a href="/wiki/Electric_power_transmission" id="w">power line</a> downed during Nina&#39;s passing.<sup id="_ref-Hayward Daily Review_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hayward Daily Review" title="">[4]</a></sup> Soon after, a <a href="/wiki/Sampan" id="w">sampan</a> called the <i>Setsu Maru</i> sent a distress call reporting that the boat was sinking 10 miles east of Niihau.<sup id="_ref-The Gleaner_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Gleaner" title="">[7]</a></sup> Even though the Navy sent the submarine rescue vessel <i>Couchal</i> and conducted an air-seas search for the vessel, no trace of the sampan or the wreckage had been found. All three people aboard the boat were reported dead as a result. Another person in <a href="/wiki/Hanapepe" id="w">Hanapepe</a> was injured when a tree came through a window in his house, causing minor forehead cuts.<sup id="_ref-Lowell Sun_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lowell Sun" title="">[8]</a></sup> The phone lines to the county seat of Kauai County, <a href="/wiki/Lihue" id="w">Lihue</a>, were broken during the hurricane.<sup id="_ref-Lowell Sun_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lowell Sun" title="">[8]</a></sup> The Aloha Theater in Hanapepe had been flooded by up to three feet of water.<sup id="_ref-Sheboygan Press_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sheboygan Press" title="">[9]</a></sup> Reports from the five major islands indicated that less than 50 homes had been damaged during the storm<sup id="_ref-Modesto Bee and News Herald_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Modesto Bee and News Herald" title="">[10]</a></sup> and roughly 12 of them being destroyed on Kauai alone.<sup id="_ref-Oakland Tribune_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oakland Tribune" title="">[11]</a></sup> Another ship disaster occurred when the <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greek</a> freighter <i>Margarita Chandris</i> got caught in the storm&#39;s winds while heading to Honolulu from <a href="/wiki/Kobe" id="w">Kobe</a>.<sup id="_ref-Coast Guard Shipwreck Files_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Coast Guard Shipwreck Files" title="">[12]</a></sup> A distress call from the ship described the ship as &#34;out of control&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Galveston Daily News_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Galveston Daily News" title="">[5]</a></sup> The initial fears were that the winds from Nina would pull the ship closer to its center.<sup id="_ref-Charleston Daily Main_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Charleston Daily Main" title="">[13]</a></sup> These fears were made worse when the ship was found to be cargoless, making it easier to be moved by the waves.<sup id="_ref-Frederick Post_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frederick Post" title="">[14]</a></sup> A later call said that the crew was unable to steer the ship.<sup id="_ref-Charleston Gazette 2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Charleston Gazette 2" title="">[15]</a></sup> Three ships, the <i><a href="/wiki/USS_Rainier_(AE-5)" id="w">Rainier</a></i>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard" id="w">United States Coast Guard</a> <a href="/wiki/Cutter_(ship)" id="w">cutter</a> <i>Winnebago</i> and the <a href="/wiki/Cargoliner" id="w">cargoliner</a> <i>President Monroe</i>, were sent out to find and guide the Chandris to port. The <i>Monroe</i> finally found the freighter and guided it toward land until the <i>Winnebago</i> caught up.<sup id="_ref-Oakland Tribune_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oakland Tribune" title="">[11]</a></sup> The cutter finally caught up to the <i>Margarita Chandris</i> and relieved the <i>President Monroe</i> and started planning to board and make repairs.<sup id="_ref-San Mateo Times 2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-San Mateo Times 2" title="">[16]</a></sup> Afterward, it was decided that the <i>Margarita Chandris</i> had enough fuel to drift into Honolulu alone.<sup id="_ref-Long Beach Press-Telegram_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Long Beach Press-Telegram" title="">[17]</a></sup> Nina&#39;s proximity also caused heavy rains, with 20.42 inches falling in Wainiha in 14 hours.<sup id="_ref-Weather and Circulation_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weather and Circulation" title="">[3]</a></sup> Overall, Hurricane Nina was responsible for $100,000 in damages (1957 USD), mostly from heavy surf, some of which measured 35 feet high.<sup id="_ref-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Records_and_naming" name="Records_and_naming"></a><h3> Records and naming </h3>
<p>While Nina was near <a href="/wiki/Honolulu" id="w">Honolulu</a>, it caused unusually high winds. When wind gusts of 82 mph were recorded at Honolulu airport during the storm, it set the record for highest wind gust ever recorded in that city.<sup id="_ref-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Central Pacific Season Summary 1957" title="">[1]</a></sup> This was the first and last time a Central Pacific hurricane was named &#34;Nina&#34;. The name was not retired, but because of the use of a current naming list using the <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_language" id="w">Hawaiian language</a>, the name &#34;Nina&#34; will likely not be used again.</p>
