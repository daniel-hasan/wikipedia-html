The <a href="/wiki/Milwaukee_Road" id="w">Milwaukee Road</a>&#39;s class <b>EP-2</b> comprised five <a href="/wiki/Electric_locomotive" id="w">electric locomotives</a> built by <a href="/wiki/General_Electric" id="w">General Electric</a> in 1919.  They were often known as <b>Bi-Polars</b>, which referred to the bi-polar <a href="/wiki/Electric_motor" id="w">electric motors</a> they used.  Among the most distinctive and powerful electric locomotives of their time, they epitomized the modernization of the Milwaukee Road.  They came to symbolize the railroad during their nearly 40 years of use and remain an enduring image of mainline electrification.</p>
<a id="Design" name="Design"></a><h2> Design</h2>

<p>In 1917, following the tremendous success of the 1915 electrification of the Mountain Division, the Milwaukee Road decided to proceed with electrifying the Coast Division.  As part of this project it ordered five new electric locomotives from General Electric for $200,000 apiece.  Their design was radically different from the <a href="/wiki/Boxcab" id="w">boxcab</a> locomotives provided by GE for the initial electrification of the Mountain Division two years earlier.</p>
<p>The most remarkable mechanical improvement was arguably the electric motors used on the new locomotives.  They were known as bi-polar motors because each of the locomotive&#39;s 12 traction motors had only two field poles, mounted directly to the locomotive <a href="/wiki/Chassis" id="w">frame</a> beside the <a href="/wiki/Axle" id="w">axle</a>.  The motor <a href="/wiki/Armature_(electrical_engineering)" id="w">armature</a> was mounted directly on the axle providing an entirely gearless design.  This design was almost entirely noiseless as it eliminated not only gear tooth growl but also the whine of higher-RPM electric motors typically used in standard nose-mounted applications.  The EP-2s were not the first electric locomotives to use bi-polar motors, which had first been designed by Asa F. Batchelder for the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Central" id="w">New York Central</a> S-motors over a decade earlier, but at the time they were the largest.

The layout of the bi-polars was unusual as well.  The locomotive body was in three sections.  A small center section contained the <a href="/wiki/Boiler" id="w">boiler</a> for generating heat for the train, while the much larger end sections contained the locomotive&#39;s electrical equipment in distinctive round-topped compartments.  The locomotive&#39;s frame was in four pieces, hinged at the joints, with the two middle sections attached to the end sections of the locomotive body.  There were twelve sets of <a href="/wiki/Driving_wheel" id="w">drivers</a> plus a single-axle idler at each end, for a 1B-D+D-B1 wheel arrangement.  All buffering forces were transmitted through the locomotive frame.</p>
<p>The bi-polars were designed to be able to pull any Milwaukee Road passenger train singly, and were delivered without <a href="/wiki/Multiple_unit" id="w">multiple unit</a> controls.  GE claimed a top speed of 90&#160;mph (145&#160;km/h) for the locomotives but the Milwaukee Road performance charts rated them at 70&#160;mph (115&#160;km/h).  They were rated at 3,180 continuous <a href="/wiki/Horsepower" id="w">horsepower</a> (2.37&#160;MW) with a continuous <a href="/wiki/Tractive_effort" id="w">tractive effort</a> of 42,000 lbf and a starting tractive effort of 116,000 lbf.</p>

<p>When the bi-polars were introduced, their modernity and distinctive design made them the most famous of the Milwaukee Road&#39;s electric locomotives.  They came to symbolize the <i><a href="/wiki/Olympian_(passenger_train)l" id="w">Olympian</a></i>, the railroad&#39;s premier train from <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_Illinois" id="w">Chicago</a> to <a href="/wiki/Seattle%2C_Washington" id="w">Seattle</a>.  Their unique appearance and power made them ideal for publicity purposes, and there was a series of demonstrations in which a bi-polar was able to out-pull contemporary <a href="/wiki/Steam_locomotive" id="w">steam locomotives</a>.  During a short period of testing on the Mountain Division, the EP-2s were shown to be less expensive to operate than the <a href="/wiki/Milwaukee_Road_class_EP-1" id="w">GE</a> and <a href="/wiki/Milwaukee_Road_class_EP-3" id="w">Westinghouse</a> electric locomotives then in use.<a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:MILW_EP-2.jpg" title="Milwaukee Road EP-2 &#34;Bi-Polar&#34; leaving Seattle, 1925."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MILW_EP-2.jpg" alt="Milwaukee Road EP-2 &#34;Bi-Polar&#34; leaving Seattle, 1925." title="Milwaukee Road EP-2 &#34;Bi-Polar&#34; leaving Seattle, 1925." class="location-none type-thumb" />

<p>The five EP-2s, numbered 10250-10254, were placed into regular service in 1919 on the Coast Division.  The Milwaukee Road saw immediate cost savings over the steam locomotives previously in use, as the bi-polars could run from <a href="/wiki/Tacoma%2C_Washington" id="w">Tacoma</a> to <a href="/wiki/Othello%2C_Washington" id="w">Othello</a> without stopping for servicing and could haul trains up <a href="/wiki/Grade_(slope)" id="w">grades</a> that had required <a href="/wiki/Double-heading" id="w">double-heading</a> steam engines.

The bi-polars operated on the Coast Division from 1919 to 1957, for most of that period without any serious rebuilding.  In 1939 they were renumbered E1-E5.  In 1953 all five of the EP-2s, which were 35 years old and worn out from heavy wartime service, were heavily rebuilt by the Milwaukee Road at a cost of about $40,000 per locomotive.  The rebuild included additional traction motor <a href="/wiki/Shunt_(electrical)" id="w">shunts</a> for increased speed, <a href="/wiki/Rolling-element_bearing" id="w">roller bearings</a>, multiple unit capability, flash boilers, and <a href="/wiki/Streamliner" id="w">streamlining</a>.  Unfortunately the Milwaukee Shop forces, unaccustomed to working on electric locomotives, did a &#34;poor job&#34; in the opinion of Electrification Department Head Laurence Wylie.  Afterwards the bi-polars were prone to electrical fires and failures.</p>
<p>Between 1954 and 1957 the bi-polars saw decreased use, and in mid-1957 were transferred off the Coast Division to the Mountain Division.  Their problems persisted, and between 1958 and 1960 all five were gradually retired.  In 1962 all except for E2 were towed to Seattle and scrapped.  
Locomotive E2 was donated to the <a href="/wiki/Museum_of_Transportation" id="w">Museum of Transportation</a> in <a href="/wiki/St._Louis%2C_Missouri" id="w">St. Louis, Missouri</a> in 1962 and moved there that year.  It has remained on static display ever since, and has been fully restored to its appearance immediately after its 1953 rebuilding.</p>
