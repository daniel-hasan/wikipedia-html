<p><i>From Russia with Love</i> is considered the best film in the James Bond series by many critics and by Connery himself, and is still highly regarded more than 40 years after its release.  <a href="/wiki/Michael_G._Wilson" id="w">Michael G. Wilson</a>, the current co-producer of the series, stated &#34;We always start out trying to make another <i>From Russia with Love</i> and end up with another <i>Thunderball</i>.&#34; In <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Total_Film" id="w">Total Film</a></i> magazine named it the ninth-greatest British film of all time.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, the film was adapted into a <a href="/wiki/Video_game" id="w">video game</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/James_Bond_007:_From_Russia_with_Love" id="w">James Bond 007: From Russia with Love</a></i>.

<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h2>Plot</h2>
<p>In a mansion garden late at night, James Bond is alternately stalking and being stalked by a tall, blond assassin. Bond is captured and strangled violently to death by the man named <a href="/wiki/Red_Grant" id="w">Red Grant</a>, using a <a href="/wiki/Garrote" id="w">garrote</a> wire hidden in a watch. Suddenly, huge floodlights switch on and the dead person turns out to be a man wearing Bond&#39;s disguise. This completes <a href="/wiki/SPECTRE" id="w">SPECTRE</a>&#39;s training exercise. </p>

<a href="/wiki/Kronsteen" id="w">Kronsteen</a>, a chess <a href="/wiki/Grandmaster_(chess)" id="w">grandmaster</a> and SPECTRE&#39;s planner has devised a plot to steal a Lektor decoding device from the Russians, and teach the British Secret Service a lesson for foiling their operative Dr. No&#39;s plans. Ex-<a href="/wiki/SMERSH" id="w">SMERSH</a> operative <a href="/wiki/Rosa_Klebb" id="w">Rosa Klebb</a> is placed in charge of the mission by the megalomaniac <a href="/wiki/Blofeld" id="w">Blofeld</a> and has already chosen a female operative, a Russian cypher clerk at the Istanbul embassy. Klebb departs to SPECTRE Island, the organisation&#39;s secret training base, and approves <a href="/wiki/Red_Grant" id="w">Red Grant</a> as an assassin.</p>
<p>In London, M tells Bond that Tatiana Romanova, the cypher clerk at the Istanbul embassy, has contacted their &#34;Station &#39;T&#39;&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Turkey" id="w">Turkey</a>, asking to defect with a Lektor cryptographic device, which both <a href="/wiki/MI6" id="w">MI6</a> and the <a href="/wiki/CIA" id="w">CIA</a> have been after for years. She has stipulated that she will only defect to Bond, whose photo she has allegedly found in a Soviet intelligence file. Bond flies to <a href="/wiki/Istanbul" id="w">Istanbul</a> to meet station head Ali Kerim Bey, and he is followed from the airport both by an unkempt man in glasses, and by Red Grant.</p>
<p>The next day, after Bey&#39;s office is bombed, Bond and Bey spy on the Russian embassy using a periscope from an underground tunnel beneath the <a href="/wiki/Consulate" id="w">consulate</a>. Seeing rival agent Krilencu, Bey takes Bond to  a rural gypsy settlement, where Bey plans to lay low while deciding how to deal with Krilencu. However the camp is attacked by  Krilencu&#39;s henchmen, who trigger gunfire and struggles with knives. Grant, lurking nearby, shoots a man who is about to kill Bond. Although he is wounded in the attack, Bey kills Krilencu the next night with Bond&#39;s sniper rifle. When Bond returns to his hotel suite, he finds Romanova in bed waiting for him. Bond and Romanova make love, unaware that they are being filmed by Grant and Klebb. </p>
<p>The next day, Romanova heads off for a pre-arranged rendezvous at the <a href="/wiki/Hagia_Sophia" id="w">Hagia Sophia</a>. Bond follows her and stalks the spectacled man who had followed him at the Istanbul airport. But unknown to Bond, the man is killed by Grant. When Bond finds the body, he finds the floor plans for the Russian Consulate that Tatiana was smuggling out for him. Bey and Bond plan to the day to steal the Lektor and smuggle it back to England. On the appointed day, Bond enters the consulate lobby. Immediately, Bey sets off an explosive charge in the chamber beneath the building releasing tear gas. In the resulting chaos, Bond is able to find Romanova and flee with the Lektor on the Orient Express. Bey and a Soviet security officer named Benz, who recognises Romanova, also board the train, but Grant stealthily kills both of them.

<p>The train continues on its journey across southern-central Europe, arriving at Belgrade where Bond arranges for an agent Nash from &#34;Station &#39;Y&#39;&#34; to meet him at Zagreb. Grant intercepts the real Nash first, boards the train, and meets Bond while impersonating the British operative. He drugs Romanova at dinner with a knock out pill, then overcomes Bond in their cabin. Grant taunts him that SPECTRE has been pitting the Russians and the British against each other. Bond offers to buy his last cigarette for 50 gold sovereigns, luring Grant to open his attaché suitcase, which releases tear gas. In the ensuing fight, Bond stabs Grant with the throwing knife hidden in the attaché case, and then uses Grant&#39;s own garrote wire against him. At dawn, Bond and Romanova leave the train, hijack Grant&#39;s getaway truck and drive to a dock, eventually boarding a powerboat. Soon, they are chased by a fleet of SPECTRE&#39;s boats. When stray bullets puncture several barrels of fuel stored on his boat, Bond throws them overboard. Pretending to surrender, he fires a <a href="/wiki/Flare_(pyrotechnic)" id="w">signal flare</a> into the water, engulfing all the enemy boats in flames. </p>
<p>Bond and Romanova reach Venice and check into a hotel, where Rosa Klebb, disguised as a maid, attempts to steal the Lektor. In the climax, Klebb has Bond at gunpoint but the gun is intercepted by Romanova. Resorting to another plan, she releases her poison tipped toe-blade. Bond takes a dining chair and pins her to the wall with it, narrowly dodging the poison tipped toe-blade. Finally, Romanova takes aim with the gun and fires it at Klebb, killing her. Riding in a <a href="/wiki/Gondola" id="w">gondola</a>, Bond throws the illicit film of him and Romanova into the canal, and they sail away.</p>

<p>The film features the first appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Major Boothroyd, known as <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)" id="w">Q</a>, the character he would play in all but two of the series&#39; films until his death in <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a>. However, screen credit for Llewelyn was omitted at the opening of the film and is reserved for the exit credits. The Q character appeared in the previous film, <i><a href="/wiki/Dr._No_(film)" id="w">Dr. No</a></i>, portrayed by actor Peter Burton, and addressed by M initially as &#34;Armourer,&#34; and as Major Boothroyd by Bond.</p>
<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h2>Production</h2>
<p>As <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" id="w">President John F. Kennedy</a> had named Fleming&#39;s novel <i><a href="/wiki/From_Russia_with_Love" id="w">From Russia with Love</a></i> among his ten favourite books of all time in  <a href="/wiki/Life_(magazine)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Life&#39;&#39; magazine</a>,<sup id="_ref-documentry_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-documentry" title="">[2]</a></sup> producers Broccoli and Saltzman chose this as the follow-up to the cinematic debut of <a href="/wiki/James_Bond" id="w">James Bond</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Dr._No_(film)" id="w">Dr. No</a></i>. <a href="/wiki/Ian_Fleming" id="w">Ian Fleming</a>&#39;s novel was a <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" id="w">Cold War</a> thriller, however the producers named the crime syndicate SPECTRE instead of the <a href="/wiki/Soviet" id="w">Soviet</a> undercover agency <a href="/wiki/SMERSH" id="w">SMERSH</a> so as to avoid controversial political overtones.<sup id="_ref-documentry_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-documentry" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The film introduced several &#34;firsts&#34; to the series which would become canonized as essential formula elements: the standard pre-title sequence, the Blofeld character, a secret weapon gadget for Bond, a helicopter sequence (repeated in every subsequent Bond film except &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Man_With_The_Golden_Gun" id="w">The Man With The Golden Gun</a>&#34;), a postscript action scene after the main climax, a theme song with lyrics, and the line &#34;James Bond will return&#34; in the credits.</p>
<p>Although uncredited, the actor who played <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld" id="w">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a>, was <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Dawson" id="w">Anthony Dawson</a>, who had played Professor Dent in the previous Bond film, <i><a href="/wiki/Dr._No_(film)" id="w">Dr. No</a></i>. Blofeld&#39;s voice was provided by Viennese actor <a href="/wiki/Eric_Pohlmann" id="w">Eric Pohlmann</a>.<sup id="_ref-documentry_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-documentry" title="">[2]</a></sup> In the end credits, Blofeld is credited with a <a href="/wiki/Question_mark" id="w">question mark</a>. It is rumoured that author and James Bond creator Ian Fleming plays a cameo in a location train scene, standing outside the train, wearing grey trousers and a white sweater.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The scene in which Bond finds Tatiana in his hotel bed was used for Daniela Bianchi&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Screen_test" id="w">screen test</a>, with Dawson standing in, this time, as Bond.<sup id="_ref-documentry_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-documentry" title="">[2]</a></sup> The scene later became the traditional screen test scene for prospective James Bond actors. This screen test forms part of the Ultimate Edition DVD series, showing potential candidates auditioning for the role down the years: <a href="/wiki/James_Brolin" id="w">James Brolin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sean_Bean" id="w">Sean Bean</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sam_Neill" id="w">Sam Neill</a> along with future 007 <a href="/wiki/Pierce_Brosnan" id="w">Pierce Brosnan</a>.  The scene has also been used to audition several James Bond leading ladies, including <a href="/wiki/Maryam_D%26%2339%3BAbo" id="w">Maryam D&#39;Abo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maud_Adams" id="w">Maud Adams</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Director Terence Young&#39;s eye for realism was evident throughout production. For the opening chess match, Kronsteen wins the game with a reenactment of <a href="/wiki/Boris_Spassky" id="w">Boris Spassky</a>&#39;s victory<a class="externallink" href="http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=1882" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=1882">http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=1882</a> over <a href="/wiki/David_Bronstein" id="w">David Bronstein</a> in <a href="/wiki/1960" id="w">1960</a>. Production Designer <a href="/wiki/Syd_Cain" id="w">Syd Cain</a> built up the &#34;chess pawn&#34; motif in his $150,000 set for the brief sequence. A noteworthy gadget featured was the <a href="/wiki/Briefcase" id="w">attaché case</a> issued by the Q-Branch containing a <a href="/wiki/Tear_gas" id="w">tear gas</a> bomb that detonates if it is improperly opened, and a folding <a href="/wiki/AR-7" id="w">AR-7</a> <a href="/wiki/Sniper_rifle" id="w">sniper rifle</a> with twenty rounds of ammunition. It also had a flat knife and fifty <a href="/wiki/Gold_sovereign" id="w">gold sovereigns</a>, the latter being described by Bond so as to lure Grant and detonate the tear gas bomb. A boxer at <a href="/wiki/Cambridge" id="w">Cambridge</a>, Young choreographed the fight between Grant and Bond, a scene violent enough to worry some on the production. Yet, Robert Shaw and Connery did most of the stunts themselves.<sup id="_ref-documentry_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-documentry" title="">[2]</a></sup> The fact that there was not as much light thrown on gadgets and vehicles as in future films has been critically appreciated, since it benefitted the storyline.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Pedro_Armendariz" id="w">Pedro Armendariz</a> was recommended to Young by director <a href="/wiki/John_Ford" id="w">John Ford</a> to play the role of Kerim Bey. After experiencing increasing discomfort on location in Istanbul, Armendariz was diagnosed with inoperable cancer. Filming in Istanbul was terminated, the production moved to England, and Armendariz&#39;s scenes were brought forward so that he could complete his scenes without delay. Though visibly in pain, he continued working to film his portions of scenes and post-production sound recording. After returning home, Armendariz took his life while under treatment at the UCLA Medical Center.<sup id="_ref-documentry_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-documentry" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the unexpected loss, production proceeded, experiencing complications from rewriting by Richard Maibaum during filming. Editor <a href="/wiki/Peter_R._Hunt" id="w">Peter Hunt</a> set about editing the film while key elements were still to be filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young conceived of moving the training exercise on a Bond double to preface the main title, a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to refilm Lotte Lenya&#39;s lines.<sup id="_ref-documentry_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-documentry" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Behind schedule and over budget, the production crew struggled to complete production in time for the already-announced premiere date that October. On <a href="/wiki/July_6" id="w">July 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland, for that day&#39;s filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young&#39;s helicopter crashed into the lake  with Art Director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft sank into 40&#8211;50 feet of water, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera for the full day&#39;s work. A few days later, Bianchi&#39;s driver fell asleep during the commute to a 6 a.m. shoot and crashed the car; the actress&#39; scenes had to be delayed two weeks while her facial contusions healed.<sup id="_ref-documentry_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-documentry" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Most of the film was based in <a href="/wiki/Istanbul" id="w">Istanbul</a> including the <a href="/wiki/Basilica_Cistern" id="w">Basilica Cistern</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hagia_Sophia" id="w">Hagia Sophia</a>, with the initial MI6 office in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>.

One of the most significant changes to the story is the replacement of the organization <a href="/wiki/SPECTRE" id="w">SPECTRE</a> to OCTOPUS because the name SPECTRE constituted a long-running <a href="/wiki/Thunderball_(novel)#Controversy" id="w">legal dispute</a> over the film rights to <i><a href="/wiki/Thunderball_(film)" id="w">Thunderball</a></i> between United Artists/MGM and the late writer <a href="/wiki/Kevin_McClory" id="w">Kevin McClory</a>.

Featuring a third-person <a href="/wiki/Multiplayer" id="w">multiplayer</a> deathmatch mode, the game depicts several elements of the earlier Bond films such as the <a href="/wiki/Aston_Martin_DB5" id="w">Aston Martin DB5</a> from <i><a href="/wiki/Goldfinger_(film)" id="w">Goldfinger</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1964_in_film" id="w">1964</a>) and the rocketbelt from <i><a href="/wiki/Thunderball_(film)" id="w">Thunderball</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1965_in_film" id="w">1965</a>).</p>
<p>The game was penned by <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Feirstein" id="w">Bruce Feirstein</a> who previously worked on the film scripts for <i><a href="/wiki/GoldenEye" id="w">GoldenEye</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Tomorrow_Never_Dies" id="w">Tomorrow Never Dies</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_World_Is_Not_Enough" id="w">The World Is Not Enough</a></i>, and the <a href="/wiki/2004_in_video_gaming" id="w">2004</a> video game, <i><a href="/wiki/James_Bond_007:_Everything_or_Nothing" id="w">Everything or Nothing</a></i>. Its soundtrack was composed by <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Lennertz" id="w">Christopher Lennertz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vic_Flick" id="w">Vic Flick</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The game begins with a standard pre-title sequence in which Elizabeth Stark, the <a href="/wiki/British_Prime_Minister" id="w">British Prime Minister</a>&#39;s daughter, is kidnapped by OCTOPUS while attending a party. Fortunately, Bond was assigned to attend the party; he defeats OCTOPUS&#39; henchmen and rescues Stark. Soon, OCTOPUS conceives a plan to avenge the death of <a href="/wiki/Dr._Julius_No" id="w">Dr. Julius No</a>. The plan involves the theft of a <a href="/wiki/Soviet" id="w">Soviet</a> encoding machine known as the Lektor with the help of a defecting Soviet agent, Romanova, being used by OCTOPUS to lure Bond into a trap; their ultimate goal is to let him obtain the Lektor and then ambush and kill him. Romanova is sent by Rosa Klebb, a KGB agent who has secretly defected to OCTOPUS. Her immediate subordinate, Red Grant, protects Bond through the first half of the game and attacks him in the second. The game ends with a final assault on OCTOPUS headquarters.</p>
