<b>Everett McGill</b> (born <a href="/wiki/October_21" id="w">October 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>) is an <a href="/wiki/US" id="w">American</a> actor.</p>
<p>McGill was born <b>Charles Everett McGill III</b> in <a href="/wiki/Miami_Beach%2C_Florida" id="w">Miami Beach</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>. He graduated from Rosedale High School, Rosedale, Kansas, in 1963.</p>
<p>McGill has a relatively short filmography, but has managed to garner some level of fame by appearing in films and television series, including a stint as Chad Richards on the <a href="/wiki/Soap_opera" id="w">soap opera</a> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guiding_Light" id="w">The Guiding Light</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a> and <a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Cult_following" id="w">cult followings</a>. After coming into the public eye in 1981 for his role as the rugged <a href="/wiki/Caveman" id="w">caveman</a> leader Naoh in <i><a href="/wiki/Quest_for_Fire" id="w">Quest for Fire</a></i>, McGill appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/Silver_Bullet_(film)" id="w">Silver Bullet</a></i>, a 1985 <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" id="w">werewolf</a> movie inspired by a <a href="/wiki/Stephen_King" id="w">Stephen King</a> short story; the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" id="w">Korean War</a> battle epic <i><a href="/wiki/Field_of_Honor" id="w">Field of Honor</a></i> and the <a href="/wiki/Clint_Eastwood" id="w">Clint Eastwood</a> war film <i><a href="/wiki/Heartbreak_Ridge" id="w">Heartbreak Ridge</a></i> in 1986; and in the 1989 installment of the <a href="/wiki/James_Bond" id="w">James Bond</a> franchise, <i><a href="/wiki/Licence_to_Kill" id="w">Licence to Kill</a></i>. </p>
<p>The muscular, 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall actor is probably most widely recognized for his work with director <a href="/wiki/David_Lynch" id="w">David Lynch</a>. McGill first worked with Lynch in the 1984 adaptation of <a href="/wiki/Frank_Herbert" id="w">Frank Herbert</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Dune_(film)" id="w">Dune</a></i>, in which he played Fremen leader <a href="/wiki/Stilgar" id="w">Stilgar</a>. McGill later appeared as a major character on the TV series <i><a href="/wiki/Twin_Peaks" id="w">Twin Peaks</a></i>, in which he played <a href="/wiki/Ed_Hurley" id="w">Ed Hurley</a>, a sensitive mechanic torn between his high school sweetheart, <a href="/wiki/Norma_Jennings" id="w">Norma Jennings</a>, and his shrewish, one-eyed wife, <a href="/wiki/Nadine_Hurley" id="w">Nadine</a>. Ed and Norma&#39;s troubled romance was one of the show&#39;s major storylines. Subsequently, McGill also appeared in Lynch&#39;s 1999 film, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Straight_Story" id="w">The Straight Story</a></i>, again as a mechanic.</p>
<p>In 1991, McGill and his <i>Twin Peaks</i> spouse <a href="/wiki/Wendy_Robie" id="w">Wendy Robie</a> appeared as the brother and sister villains of the <a href="/wiki/Wes_Craven" id="w">Wes Craven</a> feature, <i><a href="/wiki/The_People_Under_the_Stairs" id="w">The People Under the Stairs</a></i>. He appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/My_Fellow_Americans" id="w">My Fellow Americans</a></i> as &#34;twisted psycho&#34; Colonel Paul Tanner, and in <i><a href="/wiki/Under_Siege_2" id="w">Under Siege 2</a></i> as an equally twisted and ruthless <a href="/wiki/Mercenary" id="w">mercenary</a>.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Babylon_5" id="w">Babylon 5</a></i> producer <a href="/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski" id="w">J. Michael Straczynski</a> originally intended for McGill to play the role of Major Ryan in the episode &#34;<a href="/wiki/Severed_Dreams" id="w">Severed Dreams</a>&#34;.  However he did not know McGill&#39;s first name, so when he asked to have McGill contacted, Straczynski was asked if he meant <a href="/wiki/Bruce_McGill" id="w">Bruce McGill</a>, to which he replied, &#34;yes&#34;.  Even though it became apparent to Straczynski when Bruce McGill met him for lunch that this was not the McGill he expected, Straczynski decided to use Bruce McGill anyway.</p>
<p>The main character in <i><a href="/wiki/O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou%3F" id="w">O Brother Where Art Thou?</a></i> is called Everett McGill. This is probably a reference to McGill&#39;s role in <i>Quest for Fire</i>: in both movies, both characters lead a team of three in a perilous odyssey.</p>
