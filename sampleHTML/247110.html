<a href="/wiki/Hungary" id="w">Hungary</a> has made many contributions to the fields of <a href="/wiki/Folk_music" id="w">folk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Popular_music" id="w">popular</a> and <a href="/wiki/European_classical_music" id="w">classical music</a>. Hungarian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity and continues to play a major part in Hungarian music. Hungarian folk music has been influential in neighboring areas such as <a href="/wiki/Romania" id="w">Romania</a>, <a href="/wiki/Slovakia" id="w">Slovakia</a>, southern <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Poland</a> and especially in southern Slovakia and the Romanian region of <a href="/wiki/Transylvania" id="w">Transylvania</a>, both home to significant numbers of Hungarians.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> It is also strong in the <a href="/wiki/Szabolcs-Szatm%C3%A1r-Bereg" id="w">Szabolcs-Szatmár</a> area and in the southwest part of <a href="/wiki/Transdanubia" id="w">Transdanubia</a>, near the border with <a href="/wiki/Croatia" id="w">Croatia</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Bus%C3%B3j%C3%A1r%C3%A1s" id="w">Busójárás</a> carnival in <a href="/wiki/Moh%C3%A1cs" id="w">Mohács</a> is a major Hungarian folk music event, formerly featuring the long-established and well-regarded <a href="/wiki/Bogyiszl%C3%B3_orchestra" id="w">Bogyiszló orchestra</a>.<sup id="_ref-Broughton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Broughton" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hungarian <a href="/wiki/European_classical_music" id="w">classical music</a> has long been an &#34;experiment, made from Hungarian antedecents and on Hungarian soil, to create a conscious musical culture [using the] musical world of the folk song&#34;.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style.<sup id="_ref-Szabolcsi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Szabolcsi" title="">[5]</a></sup> For example, <a href="/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k" id="w">Béla Bartók</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zolt%C3%A1n_Kod%C3%A1ly" id="w">Zoltán Kodály</a>, two of Hungary&#39;s most famous composers, are known for using folk themes in their music.  Bartók collected folk songs from across Eastern Europe, including Romania and Slovakia, whilst Kodály was more interested in creating a distinctively Hungarian musical style.</p>
<p>During the era of Communist rule in Hungary (1944&#8211;1989) a Song Committee scoured and censored popular music for traces of subversion and ideological impurity. Since then, however, the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover, producing successful performers in the fields of <a href="/wiki/Jazz" id="w">jazz</a> such as trumpeter <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Tomsits" id="w">Rudolf Tomsits</a>, pianist-composer <a href="/wiki/K%C3%A1roly_Binder" id="w">Károly Binder</a> and, in a modernized form of Hungarian folk, <a href="/wiki/Ferenc_Seb%C5%91" id="w">Ferenc Sebő</a> and <a href="/wiki/M%C3%A1rta_Sebesty%C3%A9n" id="w">Márta Sebestyén</a>. The three giants of Hungarian <a href="/wiki/Rock_(music)" id="w">rock</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ill%C3%A9s" id="w">Illés</a>, <a href="/wiki/Metr%C3%B3_(band)" id="w">Metró</a> and <a href="/wiki/Omega_(band)" id="w">Omega</a>, remain very popular, especially Omega, which has followings in Germany and beyond as well as in Hungary.

Unlike other Eastern European peoples, the Hungarian people, <a href="/wiki/Magyars" id="w">Magyars</a>, emerged from the intermingling of <a href="/wiki/Finno-Ugric" id="w">Finno-Ugric</a> and Eastern <a href="/wiki/Turkic_peoples" id="w">Turkish</a> peoples during the fifth to eighth centuries CE.<sup id="_ref-Szabolcsi_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Szabolcsi" title="">[5]</a></sup>  This makes the origins of their traditional music unique in Europe.  According to author Simon Broughton, the composer and song collector Kodály identified songs that &#34;apparently date back 2,500 years&#34; in common with the <a href="/wiki/Mari" id="w">Mari</a> people of Russia;<sup id="_ref-Broughton_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Broughton" title="">[3]</a></sup> and, as well as the Mari, the <a href="/wiki/Ethnomusicologist" id="w">ethnomusicologist</a> <a href="/wiki/Bruno_Nettl" id="w">Bruno Nettl</a> indicates similarities in traditional Hungarian music with <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Mongolia" id="w">Mongolian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Native_American_music" id="w">Native American musical</a> styles.<sup id="_ref-Nettl_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nettl" title="">[6]</a></sup> Bence Szabolcsi, however, claims that the Finno-Ugric and Turkish-Mongolian elements are present but &#34;cannot be attached to certain, definite national or linguistic groups&#34;.  Nonetheless, Szabolcsi claims links between Hungarian musical traditions and those of the Mari, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Kalmykia" id="w">Kalmyk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ostyak" id="w">Ostyak</a>, northwest <a href="/wiki/Music_of_China" id="w">Chinese</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Tatarstan" id="w">Tatar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vogul" id="w">Vogul</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Turkey" id="w">Anatolian Turkish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bashkirian" id="w">Bashkirian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Mongolia" id="w">Mongol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Chuvashia" id="w">Chuvash</a> musics.  These, he claims, are evidence that &#34;<a href="/wiki/Asia" id="w">Asian</a> memories slumber in the depths of Hungarian folk music and that this folk music is the last <a href="/wiki/Western_world" id="w">Western</a> link in the chant of ancient <a href="/wiki/Eastern_world" id="w">Eastern</a> cultural relations&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Szabolcsi_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Szabolcsi" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to Broughton, traditional Hungarian music is &#34;highly distinctive&#34; like the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Hungarian_language" id="w">Hungarian language</a>, which invariably is stressed on the first syllable, lending a strongly accented <a href="/wiki/Dactyl_(poetry)" id="w">dactylic</a> <a href="/wiki/Rhythm" id="w">rhythm</a> to the music&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Broughton_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Broughton" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Nettl identifies two &#34;essential features&#34; of Hungarian folk music to be the use of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Pentatonic_scale" id="w">pentatonic scales</a> composed of <a href="/wiki/Major_second" id="w">major seconds</a> and <a href="/wiki/Minor_third" id="w">minor thirds</a>&#34; (or &#34;gapped <a href="/wiki/Scale_(music)" id="w">scales</a>&#34;<sup id="_ref-Nettl_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nettl" title="">[6]</a></sup>) and &#34;the practice of <a href="/wiki/Transposition_(music)" id="w">transposing</a> a bit of <a href="/wiki/Melody" id="w">melody</a> several times to create the essence of a song&#34;.

<p>According to Szabolcsi, these &#39;Hungarian transpositions&#39;, along with &#34;some melodic, rhythmical and ornamental peculiarities, clearly show on the map of <a href="/wiki/Eurasia" id="w">Eurasia</a> the movements of Turkish people from the East to the West&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Szabolcsi_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Szabolcsi" title="">[5]</a></sup> The subsequent influence on neighboring countries&#39; music is seen in the <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Slovakia" id="w">music of Slovakia</a> and, with intervals of the <a href="/wiki/Third" id="w">third</a> or <a href="/wiki/Second" id="w">second</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/Music_of_the_Czech_Republic" id="w">music of the Czech Republic</a>.

<p>The earliest documentation of Hungarian music dates from the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Gregorian_chant" id="w">Gregorian chant</a> in the 11th century. By that time, Hungary had begun to enter the European cultural establishment with the country&#39;s conversion to Christianity and the musically important importation of <a href="/wiki/Plainsong" id="w">plainsong</a>, a form of Christian chant.  Though Hungary&#39;s early religious musical history is relatively well documented, secular music remains mostly unknown, though it was apparently a common feature of community festivals and other events.<sup id="_ref-Ministry_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ministry" title="">[7]</a></sup>  The earliest documented instrumentation in Hungary dates back to the <a href="/wiki/Whistle" id="w">whistle</a> in 1222, followed by the <a href="/wiki/Kobzos" id="w">kobzos</a> in 1326, the <a href="/wiki/Bugle_(instrument)" id="w">bugle</a> in 1355, the <a href="/wiki/Fiddle" id="w">fiddle</a> in 1358, the <a href="/wiki/Bagpipe" id="w">bagpipe</a> in 1402, the <a href="/wiki/Lute" id="w">lute</a> in 1427 and the <a href="/wiki/Trumpet" id="w">trumpet</a> in 1428. Thereafter the organ came to play a major role.<sup id="_ref-Szabolcsi_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Szabolcsi" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The 16th century saw the rise of <a href="/wiki/Transylvania" id="w">Transylvania</a> (a north-eastern Hungarian region never occupied by the Turks) as a center for Hungarian music. It also saw the first publication of music in Hungary, in <a href="/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w" id="w">Kraków</a>.  At this time Hungarian instrumental music was well-known in Europe; the lutenist and composer <a href="/wiki/B%C3%A1lint_Bakfark" id="w">Bálint Bakfark</a>, for example, was famed as a virtuoso player.  His compositions pioneered a new style of writing for the lute based on vocal polyphony. The lutenist <a href="/wiki/Neusiedler" id="w">Neusiedler</a> brothers were also noted and authored an important early work in music theory, the <i><a href="/wiki/Epithoma_utriusque_musices" id="w">Epithoma utriusque musices</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Szabolcsi_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Szabolcsi" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>During the 17th century, Hungary was divided into three parts: an area controlled by the Turks; an area controlled by the <a href="/wiki/Habsburg" id="w">Habsburgs</a>; and Transylvania. Historic songs declined in popularity and were replaced by lyrical poetry, whilst minstrels were replaced by court musicians. Many courts or households maintained large ensembles of musicians who played the trumpet, whistle, <a href="/wiki/Cimbalom" id="w">cimbalom</a>, violin or bagpipes. Some of these ensemble musicians were German, Polish, French or Italian; the court of <a href="/wiki/G%C3%A1bor_Bethlen" id="w">Gábor Bethlen</a>, Prince of Transylvania, included a Spanish guitarist. Little detail about the music played during this era survives, however.<sup id="_ref-Szabolcsi_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Szabolcsi" title="">[5]</a></sup> Musical life in the areas controlled by the Ottoman Turks declined precipitously, with even the formerly widespread and entrenched plainsong style disappearing by the end of the 17th century.  Outside of the Ottoman area, however, plainsong flourished after the established of Protestant missions in around 1540, while a similarly styled form of folk song called <a href="/wiki/Verse_chronicle" id="w">verse chronicles</a> also arose.<sup id="_ref-Ministry_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ministry" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the 18th century, some of the students at colleges such as those in <a href="/wiki/S%C3%A1rospatak" id="w">Sárospatak</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sz%C3%A9kelyudvarhely" id="w">Székelyudvarhely</a> were minor <a href="/wiki/Nobility" id="w">nobles</a> from rural areas who brought with them their regional styles of music. Whilst the choirs in these colleges adopted a more polyphonic style, the students&#39; <a href="/wiki/Songbook" id="w">songbooks</a> indicate a growth in the popularity of homophonic songs. Their notation, however, was relatively crude and no extensive collection appeared until the publication of <a href="/wiki/Ád%C3%A1m_P%C3%A1l%C3%B3czi_Horv%C3%A1th" id="w">Ádám Pálóczi Horváth</a>’s <i><a href="/wiki/Öt%C3%B6df%C3%A9lsz%C3%A1z_%C3%89nekek" id="w">Ötödfélszáz Énekek</a></i> in 1853.  These songs indicate that during the mid to late 18th century the previous Hungarian song styles died out and musicians looked more to other (Western) European styles for influence.</p>
<p>The 18th century also saw the rise of <a href="/wiki/Verbunkos" id="w">verbunkos</a>, a form of music initially used by army recruiters.  Like much Hungarian music of the time, melody was treated as more important than lyrics, although this balance changed as verbunkos became more established.<sup id="_ref-Szabolcsi_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Szabolcsi" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Folk_music" name="Folk_music"></a><h2> Folk music </h2>
<p><i>Main article: <a href="/wiki/Hungarian_folk_music" id="w">Hungarian folk music</a></i></p>
<p>Hungarian folk music changed greatly beginning in the 19th century, evolving into a new style that had little in common with the music that came before it.  Modern Hungarian music was characterized by an &#34;arched melodic line, strict composition, long phrases and extended register&#34;, in contrast to the older styles which always utilize a &#34;descending melodic line&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Ministry_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ministry" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Modern Hungarian folk music was first recorded in 1895 by <a href="/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Vik%C3%A1r" id="w">Béla Vikár</a>, setting the stage for the pioneering work of <a href="/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k" id="w">Béla Bartók</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zolt%C3%A1n_Kod%C3%A1ly" id="w">Zoltán Kodály</a> and <a href="/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Lajtha" id="w">László Lajtha</a> in musicological collecting.  Modern Hungarian folk music began its history with the <a href="/wiki/Habsburg" id="w">Habsburg</a> Empire in the 18th century, when central <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">European</a> influences became paramount, including a &#34;regular metric structure for dancing and marching instead of the free speech rhythms of the old style.  Folk music at that time consisting of village <a href="/wiki/Bagpipe" id="w">bagpipers</a> who were replaced by <a href="/wiki/String_instrument" id="w">string</a>-based orchestras of the Gypsy, or <a href="/wiki/Roma_people" id="w">Roma people</a>.<sup id="_ref-Broughton_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Broughton" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the 19th century, Roma orchestras became very well-known throughout Europe, and were frequently thought of as the primary musical heritage of Hungary, as in <a href="/wiki/Franz_Liszt" id="w">Franz Liszt</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Hungarian_Dances" id="w">Hungarian Dances</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Rhapsodies" id="w">Rhapsodies</a></i>, which used Hungarian Roma music as representative of Hungarian folk music <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Hungarian <a href="/wiki/Roma_(people)" id="w">Roma</a> music is often represented as the only music of the Roma, though multiple forms of Roma music are common throughout Europe and are often dissimilar to Hungarian forms.  In the <a href="/wiki/Hungarian_language" id="w">Hungarian language</a>, 19th century folk styles like the <a href="/wiki/Csardas" id="w">csardas</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Verbunkos" id="w">verbunkos</a>, are collectively referred to as <i>cigányzene</i>, which translates literally as <i>Gypsy music</i>.<sup id="_ref-Sarosi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sarosi" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Hungarian nationalist composers, like Bartók, rejected the conflation of Hungarian and Roma music, studying the rural peasant songs of Hungary which, according to music historian Bruno Nettl, &#34;has little in common with&#34; Roma music,<sup id="_ref-Nettl_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nettl" title="">[6]</a></sup> a position that is held to by some modern writers, such as the Hungarian author <a href="/wiki/B%C3%A1lint_S%C3%A1rosi" id="w">Bálint Sárosi</a>.<sup id="_ref-Sarosi_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sarosi" title="">[9]</a></sup> Simon Broughton, however, has claimed that Roma music is &#34;no less Hungarian and... has more in common with peasant music than the folklorists like to admit&#34;,<sup id="_ref-Broughton_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Broughton" title="">[3]</a></sup> and authors Marian Cotton and Adelaide Bradburn claimed that Hungarian-Roma music was &#34;perhaps... originally Hungarian in character, but (the Roma have made so many changes that) it is difficult to tell what is Hungarian and what is&#34; the authentic music of the Roma.<sup id="_ref-Cotton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cotton" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Aside from the Roma and the ethnic Hungarians, Hungary&#39;s musical heritage includes the vibrant <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Serbia" id="w">Serbian traditions</a> of the communities of <a href="/wiki/Pom%C3%A1z" id="w">Pomáz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Szentendre" id="w">Szentendre</a>.

<p>In the 19th century, <a href="/wiki/Verbunkos" id="w">verbunkos</a> was the most popular style in Hungary.  This consisted of a slow dance followed by a faster dance; this dichotomy, between the slower and faster dances, has been seen as the &#34;two contrasting aspects of the Hungarian character&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Broughton_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Broughton" title="">[3]</a></sup>  The rhythmic patterns and embellishments of the verbunkos are distinctively Hungarian in nature, and draw heavily upon the folk music composed in the early part of the century by <a href="/wiki/Antal_Csermak" id="w">Antal Csermak</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_Kauer" id="w">Ferdinand Kauer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Janos_Lavotta" id="w">Janos Lavotta</a> and others.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Verbunkos was originally played at recruitment ceremonies to convince young men to join the army, and was performed, as in so much of Hungarian music, by Roma bands.  One verbunkos tune, the &#34;<a href="/wiki/R%C3%A1k%C3%B3czi_Song" id="w">Rákóczi Song</a>&#34; became a march that was a prominent part of compositions by both <a href="/wiki/Franz_Liszt" id="w">Liszt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hector_Berlioz" id="w">Hector Berlioz</a>.  The 18th century origins of verbunkos are not well-known, but probably include old dances like the <a href="/wiki/Swine-herd_dance" id="w">swine-herd dance</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Heyduck_dance" id="w">Heyduck dance</a>, as well as elements of Balkan, Slavic and Levantine music, and the cultured music of Italy and Vienna, all filtered through the Roma performers.  Verbunkos became wildly popular, not just among the poor peasantry, but also among the upper-class aristocratics, who saw verbunkos as the authentic music of the Hungarian nation.  Characteristics of verbunkos include the <a href="/wiki/Bok%C3%A1z%C3%B3" id="w">bokázó</a> (<i>clicking of heels</i>) <a href="/wiki/Cadence" id="w">cadence</a>-pattern, the use of the interval of the augmented second, garlands of triplets, widely-arched, free melodies without words, and alternately swift and slow tempi. By the end of the 18th century, verbunkos was in use in opera, <a href="/wiki/Chamber_music" id="w">chamber</a> and <a href="/wiki/Piano" id="w">piano</a> music, and in song literature, and was regarded as &#34;the continuation, the resurrection of ancient Hungarian dance and music, and its success signified the triumph of the people&#39;s art&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Szabolcsi_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Szabolcsi" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>

<p>Though the Roma are primarily known as the performers of Hungarian styles like verbunkos, they have their own form of folk music that is largely without instrumentation, in spite of their reputation in that field outside of the Roma community.  Roma music tends to take on characteristics of whatever music the people are around, however, embellished with &#34;twists and turns, trills and runs&#34;, making a very new, and distinctively Roma style.  Though without instruments, Roma folk musicians use sticks, tapped on the ground, rhythmic grunts and a technique called <a href="/wiki/Oral-bassing" id="w">oral-bassing</a> which vocally imitates the sound of instruments.

<p><i>Main article: <a href="/wiki/Hungarian_opera" id="w">Hungarian opera</a></i></p>
<p>The origins of Hungarian opera can be traced to the late 18th century, with the rise of imported opera and other concert styles in cities like <a href="/wiki/Pozsony" id="w">Pozsony</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kismarton" id="w">Kismarton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nagyszeben" id="w">Nagyszeben</a> and <a href="/wiki/Budapest" id="w">Budapest</a>.  Operas at the time were in either the <a href="/wiki/German_opera" id="w">German</a> or <a href="/wiki/Italian_opera" id="w">Italian style</a>.  The field Hungarian opera began with school dramas and interpolations of German operas, which began at the end of the 18th century.  School dramas in places like the <a href="/wiki/Pauline_School" id="w">Pauline School</a> in <a href="/wiki/S%C3%A1toralja%C3%BAjhely" id="w">Sátoraljaújhely</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Calvinist_School" id="w">Calvinist School</a> in <a href="/wiki/Csurg%C3%B3" id="w">Csurgó</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Piarist_School" id="w">Piarist School</a> in <a href="/wiki/Beszterce" id="w">Beszterce</a>.<sup id="_ref-Broughton_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Broughton" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Pozsony produced the first music drama experiments in the country, though the work of <a href="/wiki/G%C3%A1sp%C3%A1r_Pacha" id="w">Gáspár Pacha</a> and <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B3zsef_Chudy" id="w">József Chudy</a>; it was the latter&#39;s 1793 <i>Prince Pikkó and Jutka Perzsi</i> that is generally considered the first opera in a distinctively Hungarian style.  The text of that piece was translated from <i>Prinz Schnudi und Prinzessin Evakathel</i> by <a href="/wiki/Philipp_Hafner" id="w">Philipp Hafner</a>.  This style was still strongly informed by the Viennese <a href="/wiki/Zauberposse" id="w">Zauberposse</a> style of comedic play, and remained thusly throughout the 19th century.  Though these operas used foreign styles, the &#34;idyllic, lyric and heroic&#34; parts of the story were always based on verbunkos, which was becoming a symbol of the Hungarian nation during this time.<sup id="_ref-Broughton_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Broughton" title="">[3]</a></sup> It was not until the middle of the 19th century that Ferenc Erkel wrote the first Hungarian language opera, using French and Italian models, thus launching the field of Hungarian opera.<sup id="_ref-Sisa_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sisa" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Main articles: <a href="/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k" id="w">Béla Bartók</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zolt%C3%A1n_Kod%C3%A1ly" id="w">Zoltán Kodály</a></i></p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, Hungarian music was dominated by compositions in the German classical style, while Viennese-style <a href="/wiki/Operetta" id="w">operettas</a> gained immensely in popularity.  This ended beginning in about 1905, when <a href="/wiki/Endre_Ady" id="w">Endre Ady</a>&#39;s poems were published, composer Béla Bartók was published for the first time, and Zoltán Kodály began collecting folk songs.  Bartók and Kodály were two exceptional composers who created a distinctively Hungarian style.  Bartók collected songs across Eastern Europe, though much of his activity was in Hungary, and he used their elements in his music.  He was interested in all forms of folk music, while Kodály was more specifically Hungarian in his outlook.  In contrast to previous composers who worked with Hungarian idioms, Kodály and Bartók did not conflate Roma and ethnic Hungarian music, specifically seeking out the latter at the expense of the former.  Their work was a watershed that incorporated &#34;every great tradition of the Hungarian people&#34; and influenced all the later composers of the country.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Later_20th_century" name="Later_20th_century"></a><h3> Later 20th century </h3>

<p>For the first half of the 20th century, Bartók and Kodály were potent symbols for a generation of composers, especially Kodály.  Starting in about 1947, a revival in folk choir music began, ended as an honest force by 1950, when state-run art became dominant with the rise of <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">Communism</a>.  Under Communism, &#34;(c)ommitment and ideological affiliation (were) measured by the musical style of a composer; the ignominious adjectives &#39;formalistic&#39; and &#39;cosmopolitan&#39; gain currency ... (and the proper Hungarian style was) identified with the major mode, the classical <a href="/wiki/Aria" id="w">aria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rondo" id="w">rondo</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sonata_form" id="w">sonata form</a>, the chord sequences distilled&#34; from Kodály&#39;s works.  Music was uniformly festive and optimistic, with every deviation arousing suspicion; this simplicity led to a lack of popular support from the public, who did not identify with the sterile approved styles.  The most prominent composers of this period were <a href="/wiki/Endre_Szerv%C3%A1nszky" id="w">Endre Szervánszky</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lajos_B%C3%A1rdos" id="w">Lajos Bárdos</a>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

Composers from this era included <a href="/wiki/Ferenc_Szab%C3%B3" id="w">Ferenc Szabó</a>, <a href="/wiki/Endre_Szerv%C3%A1nszky" id="w">Endre Szervánszky</a>, <a href="/wiki/P%C3%A1l_Kadosa" id="w">Pál Kadosa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ferenc_Farkas" id="w">Ferenc Farkas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_R%C3%A1nki" id="w">György Ránki</a>.

<p>Hungarian popular music in the early 20th century consisted of light <a href="/wiki/Operetta" id="w">operettas</a> and the Roma music of various styles.  <a href="/wiki/Nagymez%C5%91_utca" id="w">Nagymező utca</a>, the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" id="w">Broadway</a> of <a href="/wiki/Budapest" id="w">Budapest</a>&#34;, was a major center for popular music, and boasted enough nightclubs and theaters to earn its nickname.

Some of the members of these bands formed a supergroup, <a href="/wiki/Locomotiv_GT" id="w">Locomotiv GT</a>, that quickly became very famous.

Mainstream hip-hop is extremely popular among the <a href="/wiki/Gypsy" id="w">gypsy</a> youth.</p>
<p>The Belga formation started as an offshoot hiphop project at <a href="/wiki/Tilos_R%C3%A1di%C3%B3" id="w">Tilos Rádió</a>. As lyrical innovators and phenomenal parodists, they gained wide popularity for an extremely explicit criticism of <a href="/wiki/Budapest" id="w">Budapest</a> public transport company <a href="/wiki/BKV" id="w">BKV</a>, as well as hilarious wordplays and self-irony. Their lyrics are significant beyond the hip-hop scope as a cultural documentation of turn-of-the-millennia <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_Hungary" id="w">Culture of Hungary</a>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<p>Despite being unknown for common Hungarian people, <a href="/wiki/Hardcore_punk" id="w">hardcore</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_heavy_metal_genres" id="w">metal</a> are flourishing styles of music in Hungary.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Hardcore_punk" id="w">Hardcore</a> and <a href="/wiki/Metalcore" id="w">metalcore</a> are most common in Budapest and Western Hungary, in towns like <a href="/wiki/Gy%C5%91r" id="w">Győr</a>, <a href="/wiki/Csorna" id="w">Csorna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Szombathely" id="w">Szombathely</a> and <a href="/wiki/Veszpr%C3%A9m" id="w">Veszprém</a> but the well-known <a href="/wiki/Hatebreed" id="w">Hatebreed</a>-tribute band Stillborn comes from <a href="/wiki/Debrecen" id="w">Debrecen</a>.</li>
<li>Metal bands are formed all over the country. Dominant styles are <a href="/wiki/Death_metal" id="w">death metal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Black_metal" id="w">black metal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thrash_metal" id="w">thrash</a>.

<a id="Punk" name="Punk"></a><h3> Punk </h3>

<ul>
<li>The Punk Scene was alive and kicking during the 1980s when Hungary was still under <a href="/wiki/Communist" id="w">Communist</a> Rule. Bands were underground affairs and they faced more than moral outrage - prison was a serious possibility. Two members of  Hungarian punk band “C.P.G.” were found guilty and sent to prison for two years because of making jokes about Communist leaders. After having stayed in prison the members of “C.P.G.” had to leave Hungary as did Auróra’s lead singer.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Today the Hungarian Punk Scene is low profile, but vibrant with several high quality bands singing in Hungarian and touring through the country and beyond. Summer brings a slew of punk and alternative festivals where they can all be sampled.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Top venues around Budapest are <a href="/wiki/V%C3%B6r%C3%B6s_Yuk" id="w">Vörös Yuk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Borg%C3%B6d%C3%B6r" id="w">Borgödör</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_Factory" id="w">Music Factory</a> and <a href="/wiki/A38_Haj%C3%B3" id="w">A38 Hajó</a>.</li></ul>
<p>The origins of the Hungarian punk movement go back to the early Eighties, when a handful of bands like ETA, QSS, CPG and Auróra emerged as angry young men playing fast and raw punk rock music with anti-Communist lyrics. It&#39;s ironic that while British bands like the Clash toyed with Communist ideology, punks in Hungary had to live under the reality of communism and were part of a national movement to reject it. When the change of system arrived in 1989 it brought a new situation and the punk bands, such as veterans Auróra and newcomers PICSA revolted against corruption and the americanization of the country. The new system retained the bad things from the previous one, but lacked that good things that people expected - organized crime appeared right away, but the standard of living hasn&#39;t risen.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Aur%C3%B3ra" id="w">Auróra</a>, who are the oldest Hungarian punk band with fifteen years of history, come from the Northwest Hungarian town of Győr and their originally U.K. Subs-type music has been recently updated with a NOFX-like flavor by using a trumpet in some of their ska-influenced tunes.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/PICSA" id="w">PICSA</a>, from the town of Pécs in the Southwest became infamous a few years ago, when they wrote a song entitled &#39;Hang István Csurka&#39;. Csurka is an extreme right wing politician. To cut a long story short, PICSA (aka. HétköznaPI CSAlódások meaning Everyday Disillusionments) became the second most well-known punk act due to the media coverage they got. National radicals hate them (and all the other punks) because of their anarcho-communist nation-traitor beliefs and lyrics.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Prosectura" id="w">Prosectura</a> is Hungary&#39;s third major punk act, a fun-punk four-piece who sound a bit like the <a href="/wiki/Dead_Milkmen" id="w">Dead Milkmen</a>. Similarly to PICSA, they have also been going on for about ten years. Their hometown is Szekszárd, which also has to offer another punk band similar to Prosectura: <a href="/wiki/F%C3%BCrger%C3%B3kal%C3%A1bak" id="w">Fürgerókalábak</a>. </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Out of the newer bands, two Northeast Hungarian bands are the most known, both playing California punk: <a href="/wiki/Alvin_%C3%A9s_a_m%C3%B3kusok" id="w">Alvin és a mókusok</a> come from Nyíregyháza, while <a href="/wiki/Macskanadr%C3%A1g" id="w">Macskanadrág</a> are from Salgótarján.</li></ul>
