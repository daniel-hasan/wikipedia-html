<p>{{nihongo}} is an <a href="/wiki/Action-adventure_game" id="w">action-adventure game</a> developed and published by <a href="/wiki/Konami" id="w">Konami</a>. It is part of Konami&#39;s best-selling <i><a href="/wiki/Castlevania" id="w">Castlevania</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Video_game_series" id="w">video game series</a> and the first <i>Castlevania</i> game to be released on the <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_DS" id="w">Nintendo DS</a>. It is the sequel to Konami&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Castlevania:_Aria_of_Sorrow" id="w">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a></i> and incorporates many elements from its predecessor. The game was commercially successful, selling more than 15,000 units in its first week in Japan and 164,000 units in the United States three months after its initial release.<sup id="_ref-GAFJapanSales_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GAFJapanSales" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DoSSalesFigures_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DoSSalesFigures" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The game takes place in the <a href="/wiki/Fictional_universe" id="w">fictional universe</a> of the <i>Castlevania</i> series, where the vampire hunters of the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Castlevania_characters#The Belmont clan" id="w">Belmont clan</a> wage an endless conflict against the immortal vampire <a href="/wiki/Dracula_(Castlevania)" id="w">Dracula</a>. <i>Dawn of Sorrow</i> continues the storyline found in <i>Aria of Sorrow</i>, in which Dracula has been completely defeated, and his powers assumed by his reincarnation, <a href="/wiki/Characters_in_Castlevania:_Sorrow_series#Soma Cruz" id="w">Soma Cruz</a>. With the help of his allies, Soma avoids becoming the new dark lord. A cult forms to bring forth a new dark lord by killing Soma. Soma and his allies move to ensure that a new dark lord is not created.</p>
<p><i>Dawn of Sorrow</i> incorporates many features from previous <i>Castlevania</i> games: the combination of elements from <a href="/wiki/Platform_game" id="w">platform games</a> and <a href="/wiki/Console_role-playing_game" id="w">console role-playing games</a>, the &#34;Tactical Soul&#34; system featured in <i>Aria of Sorrow</i>, and a dark, gothic atmosphere.<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-IGNReview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNReview" title="">[4]</a></sup> <i>Dawn of Sorrow</i> also introduces new gameplay elements, such as the &#34;Magic Seal&#34; system, which requires the use of the <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_DS#Input and output" id="w">DS stylus</a> to draw a pattern in order to defeat powerful enemies,<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup> a distinctive <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a> character design,<sup id="_ref-IgarashiInterview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IgarashiInterview" title="">[5]</a></sup> and a multiplayer mode, where two players compete for fastest times on a prerendered level.<sup id="_ref-IGNReview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNReview" title="">[4]</a></sup> The game received high scores from many <a href="/wiki/Video_game_journalism" id="w">video game publications</a>, and was considered one of the best games on the Nintendo DS for 2005.

During the game, the player controls the onscreen character from a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series and most <a href="/wiki/Role-playing_game" id="w">role-playing games</a>, characters <a href="/wiki/Experience_point#Level-based progression" id="w">level up</a> each time they earn a set number of <a href="/wiki/Experience_point" id="w">experience points</a> from defeating enemies; each &#34;level&#34; gained increases the character&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Statistic_(role-playing_games)" id="w">statistics</a>, thus improving their performance in battle.<sup id="_ref-GameSpyReview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpyReview" title="">[7]</a></sup> Statistics include, but are not limited to, <a href="/wiki/Hit_point" id="w">hit points</a>, the amount of damage a character can receive; <a href="/wiki/Magic_point" id="w">magic points</a>, which determine the amount of times a character can use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character&#39;s physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character&#39;s magical spells.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE10" title="">[8]</a></sup> Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon choices are largely <a href="/wiki/Medieval" id="w">medieval</a>, including but not limited to <a href="/wiki/Sword" id="w">swords</a>, <a href="/wiki/Axe" id="w">axes</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Spear" id="w">spears</a>, although <a href="/wiki/Handgun" id="w">handguns</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Rocket_propelled_grenade" id="w">rocket propelled grenade</a> are available.<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup> These weapons differ in their damage output, the range of the weapon, and the speed of the attack.<sup id="_ref-1UPReview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1UPReview" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Dawn of Sorrow</i>, similar to most games in the <i>Castlevania</i> series, is set in a castle, which is further subdivided into various areas.<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Areas of the castle differ in their composition, including monsters and terrain features. In addition, each area has its own unique piece of <a href="/wiki/Theme_music" id="w">theme music</a> that plays while the player remains in that area.<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup> The character moves around the environment based on the player&#39;s choices; however, the areas the character can move into are restricted based upon the items the player has, similar to most <a href="/wiki/Platform_game" id="w">platform games</a>.<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup> Progression, however, is not linear, as the player is free to explore the parts of the castle they have access to, and can backtrack or move forward as they see fit.<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Tactical_Soul" name="Tactical_Soul"></a><h3>Tactical Soul</h3>
<p>The primary method for the player to gain additional abilities in the game is the absorption of souls via the Tactical Soul system, which was originally featured in <i>Aria of Sorrow</i>.<sup id="_ref-IGNReview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNReview" title="">[4]</a></sup> Except for human enemies and the game&#39;s final opponent, all enemies&#39; souls can be absorbed by the player. The chances for absorbing a soul varies on the enemy, as certain enemies will release souls more regularly than others.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE14_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE14" title="">[10]</a></sup> The player can absorb multiple copies of the same soul; many of these souls will increase in effectiveness depending on the number of the same soul a player possesses.<sup id="_ref-1UPReview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1UPReview" title="">[9]</a></sup> These souls provide a variety of effects, and are separated into four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant, and Ability souls. The player can only have one type of Bullet, Guardian, and Enchant soul equipped at any given time. However, when the player acquires the &#34;Doppleg√§nger&#34; soul, the player can have two different weapon and soul setups, and switch between them at will.<sup id="_ref-IGNReview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNReview" title="">[4]</a></sup> Players can trade souls wirelessly using two <i>Dawn of Sorrow</i> game cards.<sup id="_ref-IGNReview_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNReview" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bullet souls are often projectiles, and consume a set amount of magic points upon use.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE12_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE12" title="">[11]</a></sup> Guardian souls provide continuous effects, including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning of <a href="/wiki/Familiar_spirit" id="w">familiars</a>.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE12_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE12" title="">[11]</a></sup> The movement and attacking of familiars can be directly controlled with the <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_DS#Input and output" id="w">stylus</a>.<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup> Guardian souls continually drain magic points so long as they are activated.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE12_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE12" title="">[11]</a></sup> Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are passive, and require no magic points to remain active.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE13" title="">[12]</a></sup> Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore not equipped, nor do they consume magic points.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE13_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE13" title="">[12]</a></sup> Some examples include the ability to break ice blocks with the stylus, and the ability to double-jump.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE13_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE13" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Souls can alternatively be used to permanently transform a character&#39;s weapon.<sup id="_ref-GameSpyReview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpyReview" title="">[7]</a></sup> At <a href="/wiki/Characters_in_Castlevania:_Sorrow_series#Yoko Belnades" id="w">Yoko Belnades</a>&#39; shop, the player can remove certain souls from their inventory in order to change their weapon into a stronger form.<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup> Certain weapons can only be acquired through using souls to strengthen a lesser form of the weapon.<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup> Souls are also used in the &#34;Enemy Set&#34; mode, where a player builds a custom scenario.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE20_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE20" title="">[13]</a></sup> The player can place monsters inside rooms if the player has acquired the monster&#39;s soul in the main game, but boss enemies cannot be added to any scenario, even if the player has the boss&#39; soul.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE20_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE20" title="">[13]</a></sup> Two players, using two Nintendo DS consoles, can compete in these scenarios, with the winner being the one with the fastest time in completing the course.<sup id="_ref-GameSpyReview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpyReview" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Magic_Seal" name="Magic_Seal"></a><h3>Magic Seal</h3>
<p>The Magic Seal system is a new feature introduced in <i>Dawn of Sorrow</i>, and makes use of the <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_DS#Input and output" id="w">DS stylus</a>.<sup id="_ref-GameSpyReview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpyReview" title="">[7]</a></sup> Once the player reduces the hit points of a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Boss_(video_games)" id="w">boss</a>&#34; enemy to zero, a circle will appear, and the game will automatically draw a pattern connecting any number of smaller circles on the circumference of the larger circle.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE6" title="">[14]</a></sup> After this, the player will be prompted to draw the same pattern using the DS stylus in a set amount of time.<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup> If the player fails to draw the pattern in time or correctly, then the boss will regain health and the battle will resume.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE7_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE7" title="">[15]</a></sup> If successful, the boss will be defeated.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE7_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE7" title="">[15]</a></sup> More powerful boss enemies require higher level Magic Seals, which have more intricate and complex patterns as the level increases and are found over the course of the game.</p>
<a id="Julius_Mode" name="Julius_Mode"></a><h3>Julius Mode</h3>
<p>After the player completes the game, Julius Mode is unlocked, similar to the Julius Mode in <i>Aria of Sorrow</i>.<sup id="_ref-IGNReview_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNReview" title="">[4]</a></sup> Julius Mode, in storyline terms, follows the assumption that Soma succumbed to his dark power, and became the new dark lord.<sup id="_ref-JuliusArikadoComments_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JuliusArikadoComments" title="">[16]</a></sup> A new game can then be started from the main menu in Julius Mode.<sup id="_ref-GUIDE4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GUIDE4" title="">[17]</a></sup> In Julius Mode, the playable characters include <a href="/wiki/Characters_in_Castlevania:_Sorrow_series#Julius Belmont" id="w">Julius Belmont</a>, <a href="/wiki/Characters_in_Castlevania:_Sorrow_series#Yoko Belnades" id="w">Yoko Belnades</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Alucard_(Castelvania)" id="w">Alucard</a>.<sup id="_ref-YahooGamesReview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-YahooGamesReview" title="">[18]</a></sup> Each character has a weapon and an assortment of abilities unique to them, and although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters&#39; statistics can improve by acquiring enough experience points to level up.<sup id="_ref-YahooGamesReview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-YahooGamesReview" title="">[18]</a></sup> The castle layout and enemies are the same, with the exception of the final battle, which is against Soma.<sup id="_ref-FinalBattle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FinalBattle" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<p>One year after the events in <i>Aria of Sorrow</i>, Soma is living peacefully, and believes that his powers have been lost.<sup id="_ref-DoSBeginning_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DoSBeginning" title="">[23]</a></sup> A woman who identifies herself as Celia Fortner, appears and summons several monsters. Arikado arrives to help Soma defeat the monsters, after which Soma absorbs their souls. Celia retreats, proclaiming that she will destroy Soma. Soma expresses disbelief at the return of his powers, but Arikado reveals that he never lost them.<sup id="_ref-PowerRetention_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PowerRetention" title="">[26]</a></sup> He informs Soma that Celia is the head of a cult that seeks the resurrection of the dark lord.<sup id="_ref-ArikadoCultGoal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ArikadoCultGoal" title="">[27]</a></sup> He leaves, instructing Soma not to pursue Celia.</p>
<p>Soma, however, uses information acquired from Hammer to locate the cult&#39;s base, a facsimile of Dracula&#39;s castle.<sup id="_ref-FoundCultBase_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FoundCultBase" title="">[28]</a></sup> Hammer arrives, and as he has left the military, agrees to be Soma&#39;s vendor.<sup id="_ref-HammerVendorAgain_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HammerVendorAgain" title="">[29]</a></sup> After entering the castle, Soma encounters Yoko and Julius Belmont. As Julius leaves, Soma escorts Yoko to a safe location. During this time, she instructs him in the use of a Magic Seal, which is necessary to defeat certain monsters in the castle.<sup id="_ref-MagicSealUse_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MagicSealUse" title="">[30]</a></sup> As Soma travels farther into the castle, he meets Celia, who is flanked by two men, Dmitrii Blinov and Dario Bossi. Celia explains their nature as the &#34;dark lord&#39;s candidates,&#34; who can become the dark lord by destroying Soma.<sup id="_ref-CeliaPlan_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CeliaPlan" title="">[25]</a></sup> He later encounters Dmitrii and is able to defeat him. Soma gains dominance over his soul, although he acquires no abilities.<sup id="_ref-SomaAbsorbDmitrii_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SomaAbsorbDmitrii" title="">[31]</a></sup> As Soma travels further, he comes upon Dario. Soma bests him, and Celia teleports Dario away from harm.</p>
<p>Soma meets Arikado, who is initially angered by Soma&#39;s presence, but accepts the situation. He gives Soma a letter and a talisman from Mina. Soma briefs Arikado on the current situation, and Arikado leaves to locate Dario. Soma comes upon Dario and Julius, with the latter defeated due to his inability to use a Magic Seal.<sup id="_ref-JuliusNoSeal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JuliusNoSeal" title="">[32]</a></sup> Dario retreats, instructing Soma to fight him in the castle&#39;s throne room.

Soma defeats Aguni, leaving Dario powerless. As Dario flees, Celia arrives, and instructs Soma to come to the castle&#39;s center.</p>
<p>Upon arriving, Soma is forced to watch Celia kill Mina. Furious, he begins to succumb to his dark power.<sup id="_ref-SomaEnraged_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SomaEnraged" title="">[34]</a></sup> The talisman that Mina gave Soma is able to slow the transformation, enabling Arikado to arrive in time to inform Soma that the &#34;Mina&#34; that Celia killed was a <a href="/wiki/Doppleg%C3%A4nger" id="w">doppleg√§nger</a>.<sup id="_ref-MinaDoppleganger_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MinaDoppleganger" title="">[35]</a></sup> This aborts the transformation, but a soul exits Soma and enters the doppleg√§nger, which takes on the appearance of Dmitrii. Dmitrii states that he died as a gambit to copy Soma&#39;s power of dominance, and leaves with Celia to increase his strength by absorbing the souls of additional demons.<sup id="_ref-DmitriiPloy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DmitriiPloy" title="">[36]</a></sup> Soma and Arikado chase after the two, and find them in the castle&#39;s basement.

However, his soul is unable to bear the strain of controlling the demons he has absorbed, and they erupt out of him, combining into a gargantuan creature. Soma manages to defeat the creature, but the souls that composed the demon begin to fall under Soma&#39;s dominance. He rejects them, and flees the castle with Arikado. Soma is conflicted over the present situation, as he believes it is fated that he will become the dark lord, but Arikado convinces him that his fate is not fixed.<sup id="_ref-SomaFate_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SomaFate" title="">[37]</a></sup> Soma then shares a tender moment with Mina, much to the amusement of the onlookers.</p>

<p>The production of <i>Dawn of Sorrow</i> was announced on <a href="/wiki/January_6" id="w">January 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> as the first <i>Castlevania</i> game to be released on the <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_DS" id="w">Nintendo DS</a>.<sup id="_ref-DoSAnnounce_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DoSAnnounce" title="">[38]</a></sup> Longtime <i>Castlevania</i> producer <a href="/wiki/Koji_Igarashi" id="w">Koji Igarashi</a> was in charge of the production.<sup id="_ref-DoSAnnounce_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DoSAnnounce" title="">[38]</a></sup>  In an interview, Igarashi commented that he felt that the storyline with <a href="/wiki/Soma_Cruz" id="w">Soma Cruz</a> and the Tactical Soul system were a waste to only use in one game, contributing to his desire to make a sequel.<sup id="_ref-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview" title="">[39]</a></sup> The choice to use the Nintendo DS in favor of the <a href="/wiki/Sony" id="w">Sony</a> <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_Portable" id="w">PlayStation Portable</a> was due to <i>Aria of Sorrow</i>&#39;s success on <a href="/wiki/Nintendo" id="w">Nintendo</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance" id="w">Game Boy Advance</a>, and Igarashi&#39;s observations during the 2005 <a href="/wiki/E3_Media_and_Business_Summit" id="w">E3 Media and Business Summit</a> of both consoles.<sup id="_ref-IgarashiInterviewGameInformer2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IgarashiInterviewGameInformer2" title="">[40]</a></sup> The original design team from <i>Aria of Sorrow</i>, as well as numerous new additions from <a href="/wiki/Konami#Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo" id="w">Konami Tokyo</a>, was involved in the production of <i>Dawn of Sorrow</i>.<sup id="_ref-IgarashiInterview_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IgarashiInterview" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The use of the technical features of the Nintendo DS was one of the production team&#39;s principle concerns during development.<sup id="_ref-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview" title="">[39]</a></sup> The DS touch screen was a primary point of interest, and several functions, such as picking up items on the screen and moving them, were originally intended to be incorporated.<sup id="_ref-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview" title="">[39]</a></sup> However, scheduling problems forced the development team to abandon many of these ideas.<sup id="_ref-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview" title="">[39]</a></sup> Igarashi&#39;s primary concern with using the touch screen was that it would detract from &#34;the <i>Castlevania</i> pure action gameplay,&#34; in which the player would have to slow down play in order to use the stylus.<sup id="_ref-ChatofRuinIgarashiInterview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ChatofRuinIgarashiInterview" title="">[41]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_DS#Input and output" id="w">DS microphone</a> was looked at during development, but Igarashi noted that although he found humorous uses for it, it was never seriously considered for inclusion into the game.<sup id="_ref-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>The change from the traditional dark, gothic character design of many previous <i>Castlevania</i> games to a new <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a> style was a choice made by Igarashi, who wished to market the game to a younger audience.<sup id="_ref-IgarashiInterview_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IgarashiInterview" title="">[5]</a></sup> Igarashi believed that the Nintendo DS inherently attracted a younger audience, and he was working to court them with the anime style.<sup id="_ref-GamasutraInterview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GamasutraInterview" title="">[42]</a></sup> Furthermore, Igarashi considered the anime style a litmus test for whether future <i>Castlevania</i> games would incorporate it.<sup id="_ref-IgarashiInterview1UP_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IgarashiInterview1UP" title="">[43]</a></sup> Igarashi had additionally intended to include a <a href="/wiki/White_collar" id="w">white collar</a> Japanese worker in the game.<sup id="_ref-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview" title="">[39]</a></sup> This worker would be a manager in a Japanese firm and have a family as well.<sup id="_ref-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview" title="">[39]</a></sup> However, the development team&#39;s opposition to this idea forced him to drop this prospect.<sup id="_ref-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview" title="">[39]</a></sup> For the graphical representations of the numerous enemies featured in the game, Igarashi had sprites from previous <i>Castlevania</i> games such as <i><a href="/wiki/Castlevania:_Symphony_of_the_Night" id="w">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></i> reused, and the development team redesigned them for use on the Nintendo DS.<sup id="_ref-IgarashiInterview_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IgarashiInterview" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Audio" name="Audio"></a><h3>Audio</h3>
<p>The game&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Video_game_music" id="w">music</a> was composed by <a href="/wiki/Michiru_Yamane" id="w">Michiru Yamane</a> and <a href="/wiki/Masahiko_Kimura_(composer)" id="w">Masahiko Kimura</a>.<sup id="_ref-GameFAQsInfo_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameFAQsInfo" title="">[6]</a></sup> Yamane, a longtime composer of music for the <i>Castlevania</i> series, had previously worked on the music of <i>Castlevania</i> games such as <i>Symphony of the Night</i> and <i>Aria of Sorrow</i>,<sup id="_ref-IGNCastlevaniaHistory_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNCastlevaniaHistory" title="">[44]</a></sup> while Kimura had developed the music for <i><a href="/wiki/Castlevania_(1999_video_game)" id="w">Castlevania</a></i> on the <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_64" id="w">Nintendo 64</a>.<sup id="_ref-Castlevania64Info_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Castlevania64Info" title="">[45]</a></sup> In an interview, Yamane noted that she made the music &#34;simple&#34; and &#34;easy to recognize,&#34; similar to her work on previous <i>Castlevania</i> games, and she specifically drew a parallel between her work on <i>Castlevania</i> games for the <a href="/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance" id="w">Game Boy Advance</a> and her music in <i>Dawn of Sorrow</i>.<sup id="_ref-IgarashiYamaneInterview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IgarashiYamaneInterview" title="">[46]</a></sup> Igarashi, present in the interview, asserted that making music for <a href="/wiki/Handheld_game_console" id="w">handheld game consoles</a>, regardless of the type, is largely the same, although he accepted that the DS&#39;s sound capabilities were much better than those of the Game Boy Advance&#39;s.<sup id="_ref-IgarashiYamaneInterview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IgarashiYamaneInterview" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Dawn of Sorrow</i> has received critical acclaim from many <a href="/wiki/Video_game_journalism" id="w">video game publications</a>, with several hailing it as the best Nintendo DS game of 2005. <a href="/wiki/Metacritic" id="w">Metacritic</a>, a site that compiles scores from many video game publications, gave <i>Dawn of Sorrow</i> a composite score of 89/100 based on 52 reviews.<sup id="_ref-MetacriticScores_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MetacriticScores" title="">[47]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Famitsu" id="w">Famitsu</a></i>, considered to be the most respected video game news magazine in Japan,<sup id="_ref-respected_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-respected" title="">[48]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-respected2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-respected2" title="">[49]</a></sup> as well as notorious for its &#34;extremely harsh&#34; reviews,<sup id="_ref-harsh_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harsh" title="">[50]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-harsh2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harsh2" title="">[51]</a></sup> gave <i>Dawn of Sorrow</i> a 33/40.<sup id="_ref-GameStatsScores_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameStatsScores" title="">[52]</a></sup> In Japan, the game sold over 15,000 units in its first week, acquiring the number ten slot in software sales.<sup id="_ref-GAFJapanSales_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GAFJapanSales" title="">[1]</a></sup> The game was re-released on <a href="/wiki/June_29" id="w">June 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> as part of Konami&#39;s &#34;Konami the Best&#34; line.<sup id="_ref-GameFAQsInfo_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameFAQsInfo" title="">[6]</a></sup> The game sold well in the United States, garnering over 164,000 total sales three months after its release.<sup id="_ref-DoSSalesFigures_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DoSSalesFigures" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Many reviewers noted that despite being highly similar to <i>Aria of Sorrow</i>, it managed to define itself as a standalone title. <a href="/wiki/GameSpot" id="w">GameSpot</a> commented that <i>Dawn of Sorrow</i> succeeded in continuing 2D games as a definite genre, and that it &#34;keeps that flame burning as bright as ever.&#34;<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup> In addition, GameSpot considered it for the accolade of best Nintendo DS game of 2005, with the prize ultimately going to <i><a href="/wiki/Mario_Kart_DS" id="w">Mario Kart DS</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-GameSpotBestDS2005_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotBestDS2005" title="">[53]</a></sup> Editors at <a href="/wiki/IGN" id="w">IGN</a> awarded <i>Dawn of Sorrow</i> the prize of best adventure game on the DS for 2005.<sup id="_ref-IGNBestDSAdventure_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNBestDSAdventure" title="">[54]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The gameplay, the Tactical Soul system in particular, received praise from reviewers. The sheer depth of abilities from the numerous souls found in the game was lauded, and IGN believed that the ability to have two customizable &#34;profiles&#34; of different abilities was &#34;an extremely handy idea.&#34;<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-IGNReview_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNReview" title="">[4]</a></sup> The necessity of finding multiple souls in order to strengthen abilities was criticized, with <a href="/wiki/G4" id="w">G4</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/X-Play" id="w">X-Play</a></i> claiming it was &#34;something more along the lines of <i><a href="/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_video_game_series" id="w">Pok√©mon</a></i> than <i>Castlevania</i>,&#34; and that &#34;[the soul collecting system] is not for everyone.&#34;<sup id="_ref-XPlayReview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-XPlayReview" title="">[55]</a></sup> The relative difficulty of the game and its length was also brought into question, with GameSpot noting that the game could be finished in five hours and &#34;is fairly easy as far as <i>Castlevania</i> games go.&#34;<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>GameSpot extolled the game&#39;s animation and graphics, describing the backgrounds as &#34;intricate and gorgeous&#34; and the individual animation, especially of enemies, as one of the game&#39;s &#34;highlights.&#34;<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_p" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup> IGN echoed this assessment, calling the animation &#34;stunning and fluid,&#34; and noted the differences in graphics between <i>Aria of Sorrow</i> and <i>Dawn of Sorrow</i>, stating that the latter was on a &#34;broader and more impressive scale.&#34;<sup id="_ref-IGNReview_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNReview" title="">[4]</a></sup> The utilization of an anime style of drawing the characters, as versus the traditional gothic presentation of illustrator <a href="/wiki/Ayami_Kojima" id="w">Ayami Kojima</a> in previous <i>Castlevania</i> games, was lambasted by reviewers. <a href="/wiki/GameSpy" id="w">GameSpy</a> deplored the &#34;shallow, lifeless anime images&#34; used for the characters and Kojima&#39;s absence from the production.<sup id="_ref-GameSpyReview_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpyReview" title="">[7]</a></sup> IGN believed the new images were &#34;down to the level of &#39;generic Saturday morning Anime&#39; quality.&#34;<sup id="_ref-IGNReview_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNReview" title="">[4]</a></sup> The audio by Michiru Yamane and Masahiko Kimura was highly regarded, with GameSpot stating that it was &#34;heads and shoulders above [<i>Aria of Sorrow</i>].&#34;<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup> IGN noted that the DS dual speaker system presented the audio &#34;extraordinarily well.&#34;<sup id="_ref-IGNReview_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNReview" title="">[4]</a></sup> In the review from <a href="/wiki/1UP.com" id="w">1UP.com</a>, the game&#39;s score was compared to the soundtrack of <i>Symphony of the Night</i>, and the sound quality and compositions considered &#34;excellent&#34; and &#34;exceptional&#34; respectively.<sup id="_ref-1UPReview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1UPReview" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The functionality associated with the Nintendo DS, namely the use of the touch screen and the Magic Seal system, was subject to criticism from reviewers. GameSpot noted that it was difficult to use the stylus immediately after the game prompted the player to draw the Magic Seal, thus forcing the player to use their fingernail on the touch screen.<sup id="_ref-GameSpotReview_r" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotReview" title="">[3]</a></sup> Other functions using the touch screen, including clearing ice blocks, were viewed as trivial, with GameSpy labeling it as a &#34;gimmick.&#34;<sup id="_ref-GameSpyReview_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpyReview" title="">[7]</a></sup> However, IGN dismissed the lack of DS functionality as a major issue, claiming that it &#34;doesn&#39;t hurt the product in the slightest.&#34;<sup id="_ref-IGNReview_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNReview" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
