The <b>St. Louis Cardinals</b> (also referred to as &#34;the <b>Cards</b>&#34; or &#34;the <b>Redbirds</b>&#34;) are a professional <a href="/wiki/Baseball" id="w">baseball</a> team based in <a href="/wiki/St._Louis%2C_Missouri" id="w">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. They are members of the <a href="/wiki/National_League_Central" id="w">Central Division</a> in the <a href="/wiki/National_League" id="w">National League</a> of <a href="/wiki/Major_League_Baseball" id="w">Major League Baseball</a>. The Cardinals have won 10 <a href="/wiki/World_Series" id="w">World Series</a>, the most of any <a href="/wiki/National_League" id="w">National League</a> team, and second only to the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Yankees" id="w">New York Yankees</a> in Major League Baseball, who have 26.</p>
<p>The Cardinals were founded in the <a href="/wiki/American_Association_(19th_century)" id="w">American Association</a> in 1882 as the St. Louis Brown Stockings, taking the name from <a href="/wiki/St._Louis_Brown_Stockings" id="w">an earlier National League team</a>.  They joined the National League in 1892 and have been known as the Cardinals since 1900.  The Cardinals began play in the current <a href="/wiki/Busch_Stadium" id="w">Busch Stadium</a> in 2006, becoming the first team since 1923 to win the World Series in their first season in a new ballpark.  The Cardinals have a <a href="/wiki/Cardinals-Cubs_rivalry" id="w">strong rivalry</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Cubs" id="w">Chicago Cubs</a> that began in 1885.</p>

<p>The team was formed as part of the <a href="/wiki/American_Association_(19th_century)" id="w">American Association</a> in <a href="/wiki/1882_in_baseball" id="w">1882</a> where they enjoyed great success under flamboyant owner <a href="/wiki/Chris_von_der_Ahe" id="w">Chris von der Ahe</a>. Initially they were known as the &#34;Brown Stockings&#34;, named for a previous professional team in the city, whose name was one of several &#34;Stockings&#34; teams inspired by the success of the <a href="/wiki/Cincinnati_Red_Stockings" id="w">Cincinnati Red Stockings</a>. This new team&#39;s nickname was quickly shortened to &#34;Browns&#34;. The Browns won four American Association pennants in a row, 1885-88, and played in an early version of the World Series four times, twice against the <a href="/wiki/National_League" id="w">National League</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Cubs" id="w">Chicago White Stockings</a> (now the Cubs). The Series of <a href="/wiki/1885" id="w">1885</a> ended in dispute and with no resolution. St. Louis won the <a href="/wiki/1886_in_baseball" id="w">1886</a> Series outright, the only Series of that era that was won by the AA against the NL. The vigorous <a href="/wiki/Cardinals-Cubs_rivalry" id="w">St. Louis-Chicago rivalry</a> continues to this day.</p>
<p>The Browns joined the National League in <a href="/wiki/1892_in_baseball" id="w">1892</a> following the bankruptcy of the American Association. They were briefly called the <i>Perfectos</i> in <a href="/wiki/1899_in_baseball" id="w">1899</a> before settling on their present name, a name reportedly inspired by switching their uniform colors from brown to red. There was already a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds" id="w">Reds</a>&#34; team at Cincinnati, so the St. Louis team became &#34;Cardinals&#34; (reportedly because a woman spectator exclaimed that the uniform was &#34;a wonderful shade of Cardinal.&#34;{{Fact}})</p>
<p>Also in 1899, the Cardinals&#39; owner, dissatisfied with his club&#39;s 1898 performance (twelfth place, 39 wins and 111 losses) transferred much of the talent from the other team he owned, the <a href="/wiki/Cleveland_Spiders" id="w">Cleveland Spiders</a>, to the St. Louis franchise. This led to the <a href="/wiki/List_of_worst_MLB_season_records" id="w">spectacular demise</a> of the Spiders, who fell to 20-134 (.130), along with significant improvement of the St. Louis club, which jumped from last (twelfth) place to fifth place. In effect, Cleveland and St. Louis switched places in the standings. The St. Louis-Cleveland chicanery also influenced contraction of the National League, which opened the door to the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/American_League" id="w">American League</a> as a rival to the National.</p>
<p>The change of name led to the adoption of the &#34;St. Louis Browns&#34; moniker by the American League franchise formerly known as the Milwaukee Brewers (the future <a href="/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles" id="w">Baltimore Orioles</a>) upon their move to St. Louis in 1902.</p>

The mid-<a href="/wiki/1920s" id="w">1920s</a> brought the Cardinals their first sustained success since the American Association days.  Led by <a href="/wiki/Second_baseman" id="w">second baseman</a> / <a href="/wiki/Manager_(baseball)" id="w">manager</a> <a href="/wiki/Rogers_Hornsby" id="w">Rogers Hornsby</a>, St. Louis in <a href="/wiki/1926_in_baseball" id="w">1926</a> won its first pennant in 39 years, and then shocked the baseball world by knocking off the powerful <a href="/wiki/New_York_Yankees" id="w">New York Yankees</a> in seven games in the <a href="/wiki/1926_World_Series" id="w">World Series</a>. The storied Game 7 reached its climax in the seventh inning when the previous day&#39;s winning pitcher, the aging <a href="/wiki/Grover_Cleveland_Alexander" id="w">Grover Cleveland Alexander</a>, was summoned in relief to face slugger <a href="/wiki/Tony_Lazzeri" id="w">Tony Lazzeri</a> with the bases loaded (some fans feared that Alexander might have been a little &#34;loaded&#34; himself after celebrating the previous day&#39;s win). After giving up a long foul ball, &#34;Ol&#39; Pete&#34; then struck out Lazzeri swinging on 3 low fastballs. A closely-guarded secret at the time was that both men in that confrontation happened to suffer from <a href="/wiki/Epilepsy" id="w">epilepsy</a>. In the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7, with the Cardinals clinging to a 3-2 lead, Babe Ruth drew a walk.  He chose to steal second, and was thrown out, giving the Cardinals their first World Series championship.</p>
<p>The Cardinals fell just short in <a href="/wiki/1927_in_baseball" id="w">1927</a>, then won the pennant again in <a href="/wiki/1928_in_baseball" id="w">1928</a>, edging out the resurging <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Cubs" id="w">Chicago Cubs</a> and the perennially contending <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants" id="w">New York Giants</a>. The Cardinals did not fare so well in the <a href="/wiki/1928_World_Series" id="w">World Series</a>, as the Yankees continued their dominance from 1927 and shot down the Cardinals in four straight.</p>
<p>Regardless, the stage was set for the new order of the National League. Innovative Cardinals General Manager <a href="/wiki/Branch_Rickey" id="w">Branch Rickey</a> was establishing a <a href="/wiki/Minor_league_baseball" id="w">minor league</a> <a href="/wiki/Farm_system" id="w">farm system</a> that would produce great players and keep the Cardinals in contention for the next two decades. Between 1926 and 1946, the Cardinals, Cubs and Giants would become fierce rivals, that trio winning 17 of the NL pennants during those 21 seasons.</p>

Highlights from Cardinals history include the 1930s era <a href="/wiki/Gashouse_Gang" id="w">Gashouse Gang</a> featuring <a href="/wiki/Dizzy_Dean" id="w">Dizzy Dean</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joe_Medwick" id="w">Joe Medwick</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pepper_Martin" id="w">Pepper Martin</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Leo_Durocher" id="w">Leo Durocher</a>.</p>
<p>The Cardinals lost the <a href="/wiki/1930_World_Series" id="w">1930 World Series</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Oakland_Athletics" id="w">Philadelphia Athletics</a> 4 games to 2, but came back strong the following year (<a href="/wiki/1931_World_Series" id="w">1931)</a>, playing an aggressive game of &#34;inside&#34; ball that broke the back of the A&#39;s in 7 games.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1934_in_baseball" id="w">1934</a>, Dean and his younger brother, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Dean_(baseball)" id="w">Paul</a>, combined to win 49 games - still a single season record for brothers. Dizzy, whose real name was Jay Hanna Dean and was called &#34;Jay&#34; by his pals, won 30 of them, with Paul (facetiously nicknamed &#34;Daffy&#34; by the press) contributing 19. Dean&#39;s country humor made him a popular favorite, particularly in the rural south and midwest where Cardinals fans were numerous.  The outgoing &#34;Diz&#34; and the shy &#34;Daf&#34; (a pair that Diz called &#34;Me an&#39; Paul&#34;) sometimes teamed up in doubleheaders.  On <a href="/wiki/September_21" id="w">September 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1934" id="w">1934</a>, Dizzy won the first game, allowing one hit.  Then Paul pitched a no-hitter in the second game.  Later, Diz jokingly remarked that he wished Paul had told him he was going to throw a no-hitter, because &#34;Then I&#39;d&#39;ve pitched one too!&#34;</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1935_in_baseball" id="w">1935</a> the Cardinals were overcome and defeated by the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Cubs" id="w">Chicago Cubs</a>, who reeled off 21 straight wins in September.  The Cubs clinched the pennant in St. Louis, although their streak had been snapped by then.  In <a href="/wiki/1937_in_baseball" id="w">1937</a>, Dizzy Dean&#39;s toe was broken by a line drive in the [All-Star Game], and he injured his arm altering his pitching motion during the recovery process, losing his famous fastball, and signalling a brief decline by the Cardinals.</p>

<p>In the early 1940s, the Cardinals dominated the National League.  The <a href="/wiki/1942_in_baseball" id="w">1942</a> &#34;St. Louis Swifties&#34; won 106 games, the most in franchise history, and are widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball teams of all time, beating the Yankees in <a href="/wiki/1942_World_Series" id="w">five games</a>. Outfielder <a href="/wiki/Stan_Musial" id="w">Stan Musial</a> played his first full season with the 1942 Cardinals.  Known to loyal fans as &#34;The Man&#34;, Musial spent 22 years in a Cardinals uniform, 1941-1944, 1946-1963.  He won seven batting titles and three MVP awards, and his 3,630 hits remain the 4th highest in baseball history.  In August 1968, a statue of Musial was dedicated outside <a href="/wiki/Busch_Memorial_Stadium" id="w">Busch Memorial Stadium</a>.  In <a href="/wiki/1943_in_baseball" id="w">1943</a> and again in <a href="/wiki/1944_in_baseball" id="w">1944</a> they posted the second-best records in team history at 105-49. The Yankees got revenge in the <a href="/wiki/1943_World_Series" id="w">1943 World Series</a>, beating the Cardinals in five games.  The <a href="/wiki/1944_World_Series" id="w">1944 World Series</a> was particularly memorable as they met their crosstown rivals, the <a href="/wiki/St._Louis_Browns" id="w">St. Louis Browns</a>, in the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Tram" id="w">Streetcar</a> Series&#34;. The Cardinals won four games to two.  All six games were played in <a href="/wiki/Sportsman%26%2339%3Bs_Park" id="w">Sportsman&#39;s Park</a>, which the two teams shared. <a href="/wiki/Billy_Southworth" id="w">Billy Southworth</a>, the manager for all three of those seasons, remains the only Cardinal manager to guide his team to three straight pennants.</p>
<p>After finishing 3 games behind the Cubs in 1945 without &#34;The Man&#34; who was in the U.S. Navy, St. Louis came back to tie for the pennant in <a href="/wiki/1946_in_baseball" id="w">1946</a>, and ousted the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers" id="w">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> in a playoff series to get to the World Series.  They faced a powerful <a href="/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox" id="w">Boston Red Sox</a> team and defeated them in <a href="/wiki/1946_World_Series" id="w">7 games</a>, the eventual winning run in Game 7 coming in the eighth inning on <a href="/wiki/Enos_Slaughter" id="w">Enos Slaughter</a>&#39;s famous &#34;mad dash&#34; around the bases on a hit to shallow left-center field.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1947_in_baseball" id="w">1947</a>, the Cardinals, were perhaps among the most famous of the MLB teams who allegedly (the accusation is disputed<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>) attempted to boycott games against the <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn_Dodgers" id="w">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> to protest the Dodgers&#39; signing of a black player, <a href="/wiki/Jackie_Robinson" id="w">Jackie Robinson</a>.  The alleged ringleader of the boycott was <a href="/wiki/Enos_Slaughter" id="w">Enos Slaughter</a>.  National League president <a href="/wiki/Ford_Frick" id="w">Ford Frick</a> threatened to ban any players who boycotted any games, and the boycott never happened.  The Cardinals did not sign a black player until <a href="/wiki/1954_in_baseball" id="w">1954</a> with part-timer <a href="/wiki/Tom_Alston" id="w">Tom Alston</a> and did not sign a black regular until <a href="/wiki/Curt_Flood" id="w">Curt Flood</a> in <a href="/wiki/1958_in_baseball" id="w">1958</a>.  The Cardinals&#39; resistance to the trend of hiring minority talent contributed to a team slump that ran from the late 1940s until the early 1960s. However, the organization was also the first Major League team to integrate spring training housing a decade later.</p>

Rickey had a falling-out with longtime owner <a href="/wiki/Sam_Breadon" id="w">Sam Breadon</a>, and left the team to become general manager and part-owner of the Dodgers in <a href="/wiki/1942_in_baseball" id="w">1942</a>.  With Breadon as effectively a one-man band, the Cardinals faded into the pack after their 1946 Series victory.  After finding out he had terminal cancer, Breadon sold the team to former <a href="/wiki/United_States_Postmaster_General" id="w">United States Postmaster General</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_Hannegan" id="w">Robert Hannegan</a> and businessman <a href="/wiki/Fred_Saigh" id="w">Fred Saigh</a> for $3 million.  Hannegan died in <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a>, leaving Saigh as sole owner.  Although the Cardinals remained competitive, they were on shaky financial ground.  Meanwhile, the Browns, under new owner <a href="/wiki/Bill_Veeck" id="w">Bill Veeck</a>, began a concerted effort to drive the Cardinals out of town.  Ironically, the Cardinals had been the Browns&#39; tenants since <a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a> at <a href="/wiki/Sportsman%26%2339%3Bs_Park" id="w">Sportsman&#39;s Park</a>, even though the Cardinals had long since passed the Browns as the city&#39;s dominant team.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a>, however, Saigh was convicted of <a href="/wiki/Tax_evasion" id="w">tax evasion</a>.  Facing almost certain banishment from baseball, Saigh turned down higher offers from other cities in favor of a bid from the <a href="/wiki/Anheuser-Busch" id="w">Anheuser-Busch</a> brewery.  <a href="/wiki/August_Busch%2C_Jr." id="w">August &#34;Gussie&#34; Busch</a> took over as team president.  Soon afterward, Veeck was forced to sell Sportsman&#39;s Park to the Cardinals under threat of having the facility condemned.  Busch heavily renovated the 44-year-old park, renaming it <i>Busch Stadium.</i>  Within a year, the Browns were forced to move to <a href="/wiki/Baltimore" id="w">Baltimore</a> as the <a href="/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles" id="w">Orioles</a>.</p>

The Cardinals front office continued to improve their minority hiring record, and built the Cardinals into another of their periodic dynasties. In <a href="/wiki/1963_in_baseball" id="w">1963</a>, they made a late-season run against the Dodgers which came close to putting <a href="/wiki/Stan_Musial" id="w">Stan Musial</a> into a World Series in his announced final season. The Dodgers held them off on that occasion, but for the last six years before divisional play went into effect in <a href="/wiki/1969_in_baseball" id="w">1969</a> and changed the nature of the pennant races, there were only two colors on National League pennants: Dodger Blue and Cardinal Red.</p>
<p>The year <a href="/wiki/1964_in_baseball" id="w">1964</a> saw one of the wildest pennant races in baseball history. The <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies" id="w">Philadelphia Phillies</a> seemed to have a commanding lead from 6 1/2 games ahead with only 12 games to play, but fell apart in the last two weeks of the season, as the Cardinals and other teams pounced on the opportunity. The Cardinals, thanks in part to the mid-season acquisition of <a href="/wiki/Lou_Brock" id="w">Lou Brock</a> from the Cubs, swept a 3-game series from Philadelphia to take over first, then clinched on the last day of the season, finishing a game ahead of the Phillies and the <a href="/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds" id="w">Cincinnati Reds</a>, with the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants" id="w">San Francisco Giants</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_Braves" id="w">Milwaukee Braves</a> close behind.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/1964_World_Series" id="w">1964 World Series</a> matched the upstart &#34;Redbirds&#34;, led by third baseman and captain <a href="/wiki/Ken_Boyer" id="w">Ken Boyer</a>, with the veteran <a href="/wiki/New_York_Yankees" id="w">Yankees</a>, who featured his younger brother <a href="/wiki/Clete_Boyer" id="w">Clete</a>, also an All-Star third baseman. Ken Boyer&#39;s stunning <a href="/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)" id="w">grand slam</a> home run in Game 4 at <a href="/wiki/Yankee_Stadium" id="w">Yankee Stadium</a>, along with the overpowering pitching of their young hurler <a href="/wiki/Bob_Gibson" id="w">Bob Gibson</a>, resulted in a 4 games to 3 win by the Cardinals. Ken was named <a href="/wiki/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" id="w">National League Most Valuable Player</a> at the conclusion of the season. This was the last Series appearance by the &#34;Old&#34; Yankees dynasty, which had appeared in 14 of the 16 series played from <a href="/wiki/1949_in_baseball" id="w">1949</a> to 1964. Prior to 2001, the Cardinals remained the only team to hold an overall World Series edge against the Yankees, 3 Series to 2.</p>
<p>In a slightly bizarre post-season twist, manager <a href="/wiki/Johnny_Keane" id="w">Johnny Keane</a>, who had been targeted for firing before the Cardinals&#39; made their late-season comeback, left the team and took the job managing the Yankees. The Cardinals then promoted coach <a href="/wiki/Red_Schoendienst" id="w">Red Schoendienst</a>, who would take the managerial helm for the next 12 seasons. (According to <i>The Baseball Hall of Shame</i> by Nash and Zullo, the owners of the Cardinals and of the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Yankees" id="w">New York Yankees</a> had decided, during the season, to replace their managers, Keane and <a href="/wiki/Yogi_Berra" id="w">Yogi Berra</a>, after the season, regardless of the season&#39;s outcome. When these two teams happened to meet in the World Series, this plan received a great deal of attention.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1967_in_baseball" id="w">1967</a>, the Cardinals (&#34;El Birdos&#34;) romped through the National League by 10 1/2 games with a superb 101-60 (.627) record, and then defeated the <a href="/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox" id="w">Boston Red Sox</a> in the <a href="/wiki/1967_World_Series" id="w">World Series</a>, bursting &#34;<a href="/wiki/Man_of_La_Mancha" id="w">The Impossible Dream</a>&#34; bubble of the latter team, which had won their first pennant in 21 years, on the last day of the season. The 1967 team featured future Hall of Famers <a href="/wiki/Lou_Brock" id="w">Lou Brock</a>, <a href="/wiki/Orlando_Cepeda" id="w">Orlando Cepeda</a>, <a href="/wiki/Steve_Carlton" id="w">Steve Carlton</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bob_Gibson" id="w">Bob Gibson</a>, who won 3 games in the Series who was again named Series MVP, as he was in 1964.  <a href="/wiki/KMOX" id="w">KMOX</a> radio also awarded Lou Brock a car for his superb play (12-29 .414 with a record-tying 7 stolen bases) in the Series.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1968_in_baseball" id="w">1968</a>, &#34;The Year of the Pitcher,&#34; Gibson finished with an astonishingly low <a href="/wiki/Earned_run_average" id="w">ERA</a> of 1.12 winning 22 games and the Cy Young Award, and the Cardinals again won the pennant (97-65 .599), with a comfortable 9-game margin. Although essentially the same team as the previous year, they faced a tougher opponent in the <a href="/wiki/Detroit_Tigers" id="w">Detroit Tigers</a>, who had also won their pennant easily, behind the 31-win season of <a href="/wiki/Denny_McLain" id="w">Denny McLain</a>. Even though pitchers Gibson and McLain both were rare league <a href="/wiki/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" id="w">MVPs</a> that season, another Tigers starter, <a href="/wiki/Mickey_Lolich" id="w">Mickey Lolich</a>, stole the show, becoming the last pitcher to date to win three complete games in a single Series. The Tigers won the closely contested <a href="/wiki/1968_World_Series" id="w">7-game affair</a>. It was the last Series appearance for this great Cardinals team, and the last Series before baseball adopted its divisional format.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/1969_in_baseball" id="w">1969</a> saw a number of changes as the major leagues expanded into 24 teams and 4 divisions.  The resurgent <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Cubs" id="w">Chicago Cubs</a> led the newly-formed NL East Division for much of the summer before falling apart in the last month. The Cardinals put on a mid-season surge, as their famous announcer <a href="/wiki/Harry_Caray" id="w">Harry Caray</a> (in what would prove to be his final season of 25 doing Cardinals broadcasts) began singing, &#34;The Cardinals are coming, tra-la-la-la&#34;. Ultimately the &#34;Miracle&#34; <a href="/wiki/New_York_Mets" id="w">New York Mets</a> would win the division, the league championship and the <a href="/wiki/1969_World_Series" id="w">World Series</a>.</p>

In <a href="/wiki/1970_in_baseball" id="w">1970</a>, <a href="/wiki/Curt_Flood" id="w">Curt Flood</a>, along with <a href="/wiki/Tim_McCarver" id="w">Tim McCarver</a>, <a href="/wiki/Byron_Browne" id="w">Byron Browne</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Joe_Hoerner" id="w">Joe Hoerner</a>, were to be traded to the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies" id="w">Philadelphia Phillies</a> for <a href="/wiki/Dick_Allen" id="w">Dick Allen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cookie_Rojas" id="w">Cookie Rojas</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dick_Donovan" id="w">Dick Donovan</a>. However, Flood would challenge the reserve clause since he did not want to play for one of the worst teams in the <a href="/wiki/National_League" id="w">National League</a>. As a result, <a href="/wiki/Willie_Montanez" id="w">Willie Montanez</a> and another player would compensate for Flood as he would set the tone for <a href="/wiki/Free_agency" id="w">free agency</a>. Also in 1970, Bob Gibson would continue his dominance as he won another <a href="/wiki/Cy_Young_Award" id="w">Cy Young Award</a>, winning 23 games. He would be the last Cardinal to win it until <a href="/wiki/Chris_Carpenter" id="w">Chris Carpenter</a> won it in <a href="/wiki/2005_in_baseball" id="w">2005</a>.</p>
<p>Another deal with the Phillies proved to be even more disastrous.  Prior to the <a href="/wiki/1972_in_baseball" id="w">1972</a> season, owner Gussie Busch refused to renegotiate the contract of left-handed pitcher <a href="/wiki/Steve_Carlton" id="w">Steve Carlton</a>, who was coming off of his first 20-win season and an appearance in the <a href="/wiki/1971_All-Star_Game" id="w">All-Star Game</a>. Instead of paying the money, Busch traded Carlton to Philadelphia for right-hander <a href="/wiki/Rick_Wise" id="w">Rick Wise</a>.  Carlton immediately turned the deal into a steal for the Phillies by winning 27 games and the <a href="/wiki/Cy_Young_Award" id="w">Cy Young Award</a> for a club that finished the 1972 season at 59-97, setting a record for highest percentage of team wins (45.8%).  Wise would be gone from St. Louis by 1974; Carlton would go on to the <a href="/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum" id="w">Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
<p>The Cardinals continued to be perennial contenders throughout the 1970s, placing second in the National League Eastern Division and finishing above .500 six times during the decade. In <a href="/wiki/1974_in_baseball" id="w">1974</a>, Lou Brock led the team in a pennant race against the Pirates by breaking Maury Wills single-season stolen base record (104) set in 1962. Brock set a new record of 118 in &#39;74 but the Cardinals finished a game-and-a-half behind Pittsburgh.  Popular manager <a href="/wiki/Red_Schoendienst" id="w">Red Schoendienst</a>, was replaced in <a href="/wiki/1977_in_baseball" id="w">1977</a> after 12 seasons guiding the Cardinals, as many players arrived and departed the Gateway City.  <a href="/wiki/Joe_Torre" id="w">Joe Torre</a> won the <a href="/wiki/1971_in_baseball" id="w">1971</a> National League MVP award hitting .363 with 24 HRs, but was later traded to the Mets. <a href="/wiki/Jose_Cruz" id="w">Jose Cruz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dick_Allen" id="w">Dick Allen</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ted_Sizemore" id="w">Ted Sizemore</a> were all dealt away to other teams in the league.  <a href="/wiki/Ted_Simmons" id="w">Ted Simmons</a> led the team in On-Base-Percentage six times during the decade, but more changes would come as the Cardinals began to retool the roster to become champions again.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1979_in_baseball" id="w">1979</a>, <a href="/wiki/Keith_Hernandez" id="w">Keith Hernandez</a> was the co-<a href="/wiki/National_League" id="w">NL</a> <a href="/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" id="w">MVP</a> while <a href="/wiki/Pete_Vuckovich" id="w">Pete Vuckovich</a> and <a href="/wiki/Silvio_Martinez" id="w">Silvio Martinez</a> each won 15 games.  <a href="/wiki/Garry_Templeton" id="w">Garry Templeton</a> became the first switch-hitter to collect 100 hits from each side of the plate and led the league in triples for a third consecutive season.

<p>After a less-than-successful 1970s, new Cardinal manager <a href="/wiki/Whitey_Herzog" id="w">Whitey Herzog</a>, affectionately known to fans as the <i>White Rat</i>, revived the winning tradition at Busch Stadium.  Herzog&#39;s brand of baseball, known in St. Louis as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Whiteyball" id="w">Whiteyball</a>&#34;, catered to the hard <a href="/wiki/Astroturf" id="w">Astroturf</a> of Busch Stadium and featured speed on the base paths, sparkling defense, and unconventional roster moves. Herzog was known to put the pitcher in right field, bring in a reliever for one batter, and then put the original pitcher back on the mound. In his 11 years as Cardinal manager, Herzog won three National League pennants, and a <a href="/wiki/1982_World_Series" id="w">1982 World Series</a> title. The 1980s era Cardinals included stars <a href="/wiki/Darrell_Porter" id="w">Darrell Porter</a> (1982 NLCS and World Series MVP), <a href="/wiki/Ozzie_Smith" id="w">Ozzie Smith</a>, <a href="/wiki/Willie_McGee" id="w">Willie McGee</a> (1985 NL MVP who won two batting titles in a Cardinals uniform), <a href="/wiki/John_Tudor" id="w">John Tudor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Herr" id="w">Tom Herr</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jack_Clark_(baseball)" id="w">Jack Clark</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Sutter" id="w">Bruce Sutter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Keith_Hernandez" id="w">Keith Hernandez</a>, <a href="/wiki/Terry_Pendleton" id="w">Terry Pendleton</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Joaqu%C3%ADn_Andujar" id="w">Joaquín Andujar</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/1985_World_Series" id="w">1985 World Series</a>, christened the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Interstate_70" id="w">I-70</a> Series&#34; because it featured the in-state rival <a href="/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals" id="w">Kansas City Royals</a>, is perhaps the most controversial in Cardinals history. The Series started ominously for the Cardinals as their rookie lead-off hitter and catalyst, <a href="/wiki/Vince_Coleman" id="w">Vince Coleman</a>, who stole 110 bases that year, was run into by the mechanical <a href="/wiki/Tarpaulin" id="w">tarpaulin</a> at Busch Stadium during the NLCS.  Scribes joked about a &#34;killer tarp&#34;, but the remark proved metaphorical, as Coleman was unable to play in the Fall Classic. Game 6 of that Series featured &#34;<a href="/wiki/I-70_Series#&#34;The Call&#34;" id="w">The Call</a>.&#34; In the bottom of the 9th inning, umpire <a href="/wiki/Don_Denkinger" id="w">Don Denkinger</a> called Royals batter <a href="/wiki/Jorge_Orta" id="w">Jorge Orta</a> safe at first base — a call refuted by broadcast television&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Instant_replay" id="w">instant replay</a>. The Cardinals, leading 1-0 at the time of the play and needing that victory to clinch the title, went on to lose Game 6 a few batters later by the score of 2-1. The &#34;Runnin&#39; Redbirds&#34; then were blown out of Game 7 the following night, by the score of 11-0, as both of their pitching aces failed to come through on this occasion — <a href="/wiki/John_Tudor" id="w">John Tudor</a>, who, upon being removed from the game, punched a mechanical fan and severely cut his pitching hand, and <a href="/wiki/Joaqu%C3%ADn_And%C3%BAjar" id="w">Joaquín Andújar</a>, who was ejected by home plate umpire Denkinger for arguing balls and strikes.</p>
<p>The Cardinals again won the National League pennant in 1987, but lost to the <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_Twins" id="w">Minnesota Twins</a> 4 games to 3 in the <a href="/wiki/1987_World_Series" id="w">World Series</a>. This time, St. Louis was without clean-up hitter <a href="/wiki/Jack_Clark_(baseball)" id="w">Jack Clark</a>, the team&#39;s #1 offensive threat, who caught a cleat in the abominable turf at Montreal&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Stadium_(Montreal)" id="w">Olympic Stadium</a> in the closing days of the regular season. The Series was the first in which the home team won each of the seven games. The Cardinals held their own at Busch Stadium, but the electronically-enhanced crowd noise and the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Homer_Hankie" id="w">Homer Hankies</a>&#34; in the <a href="/wiki/Hubert_H._Humphrey_Metrodome" id="w">Metrodome</a> seemed to spook the Redbirds. The booming bats of the Twins, which seemed to come alive only in the &#34;Homerdome,&#34; were too much for the Cardinals &#34;<a href="/wiki/Inside_baseball" id="w">inside baseball</a>&#34; style of offense to overcome. Games 1, 2, and 6 were pretty much blowouts, and in Game 7 the Twins&#39; pitching shut down the Cardinals.</p>

<p>After August Busch, Jr. died in 1989, the Cardinals would finish in last place in 1990 with <a href="/wiki/Whitey_Herzog" id="w">Whitey Herzog</a> resigning.  He was replaced by Schoendienst and eventually <a href="/wiki/Joe_Torre" id="w">Joe Torre</a>. During Torre&#39;s tenure in St. Louis, the Cardinals&#39; highest finish was 87 wins (3rd place in 1993). </p>
<p>In 1995, Anheuser-Busch, Inc. sold the Cardinals team and Busch Stadium to a new ownership group headed by Southwest Bank&#39;s Drew Baur, Fred Hanser and <a href="/wiki/William_DeWitt%2C_Jr." id="w">William DeWitt, Jr.</a>, for a price substantially undervalued in order to keep the team in St. Louis.  Additionally, Civic Center Redevelopment, earlier acquired by A-B, sold the parking garages and other surrounding property owned by this quasi-civic organization to the new ownership group.</p>
<p>The new ownership group almost immediately sold off the parking garages next to the stadium to an investment group.  With the proceeds of sale from the garages, the cost basis in the team was in the $100 million range, a real steal considering that Forbes Magazine values the Cardinals franchise on the high side of $300 million.</p>

The year before the sale of the team, Anheuser-Busch had hired baseball executive <a href="/wiki/Walt_Jocketty" id="w">Walt Jocketty</a> as their new general manager.  With a new ownership group in place and their commitment to return a winning team to St. Louis, Jocketty&#39;s expertise in locating baseball talent soon was tested in one of baseball&#39;s most successful franchises.</p>
<p>The Cardinals reached the playoffs in 1996 (the first season for long-time <a href="/wiki/Oakland_Athletics" id="w">Oakland Athletics</a> manager <a href="/wiki/Tony_La_Russa" id="w">Tony La Russa</a>), but the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_Braves" id="w">Atlanta Braves</a> defeated them for the National League pennant. The Cardinals blew a 3-1 series lead to the Braves in the 1996 NLCS.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1997_in_baseball" id="w">1997</a>, the team finished fourth in the NL Central Division with a record of 73-89.  <a href="/wiki/Mark_McGwire" id="w">Mark McGwire</a> arrived and hit 24 home runs in only 51 games.  <a href="/wiki/Delino_DeShields" id="w">Delino DeShields</a> led the league with 14 triples.</p>
<p>In 1998, Cardinals&#39; first baseman <a href="/wiki/Mark_McGwire" id="w">Mark McGwire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sammy_Sosa" id="w">Sammy Sosa</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Cubs" id="w">Chicago Cubs</a> battled to set the record for most <a href="/wiki/Home_run" id="w">home runs</a> in one season.

Somewhat ironically, it was the shortest home run McGwire hit that season.  McGwire went on to finish with 70 home runs and had a section of <a href="/wiki/Interstate_70" id="w">Interstate 70</a> running through downtown St. Louis re-named &#34;the Mark McGwire Highway&#34;. His record stood until <a href="/wiki/Barry_Bonds" id="w">Barry Bonds</a> hit 73 in 2001.</p>

In 2000, the Cardinals went 95-67, posting their best record since the &#39;87 team that lost the World Series to the Twins.  However, the Cardinals, their starting rotation in disarray after the injury to Garrett Stephenson and the meltdown of <a href="/wiki/Rick_Ankiel" id="w">Rick Ankiel</a>, lost to the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Mets" id="w">New York Mets</a> in the National League Championship Series.</p>
<p>In 2001, the Cardinals finished the season with a 93-69 record. The <a href="/wiki/Houston_Astros" id="w">Houston Astros</a>, also in the National League Central, finished with an identical record. Both teams were awarded a co-championship.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>Since Houston won the season series against the Cardinals, 9 games to 7 games, Houston received the NL Central playoff seeding and St. Louis received the wild card berth. Major League Baseball refers to the 2001 Cardinals as &#34;co-division champions&#34; along with the Astros and notes that this was the first shared championship in major league history. Helping the Cardinals accomplish this was 21 year old rookie third baseman <a href="/wiki/Albert_Pujols" id="w">Albert Pujols</a>, who hit 37 home runs and won the National League Rookie of the Year award. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  On September 3, <a href="/wiki/Bud_Smith" id="w">Bud Smith</a> became the ninth Cardinal and 18th rookie since 1900 to throw a no-hitter.  St. Louis lost in the first round of the playoffs to the eventual world champion <a href="/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks" id="w">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>.  After the season <a href="/wiki/Mark_McGwire" id="w">Mark McGwire</a> retired due to a chronic knee injury.</p>
<p>In 2002, the Cardinals won the Central Division and this time defeated the Diamondbacks 3 games to none to reach the <a href="/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series" id="w">NLCS</a>, but lost 4 games to 1 to the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants" id="w">San Francisco Giants</a>. On <a href="/wiki/June_18" id="w">June 18</a>, broadcaster <a href="/wiki/Jack_Buck" id="w">Jack Buck</a> had died. Ten months earlier, Buck (despite ailing from <a href="/wiki/Lung_cancer" id="w">lung cancer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Parkinson%26%2339%3Bs_disease" id="w">Parkinson&#39;s disease</a>) stirred emotions when he addressed the crowd at Busch Stadium when Major League Baseball resumed after the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks" id="w">September 11 terrorist attacks</a>. Four days after Buck&#39;s death, pitcher <a href="/wiki/Darryl_Kile" id="w">Darryl Kile</a> died of heart failure while in Chicago for a series against the Cubs.</p>
<p>After missing the playoffs in 2003, St. Louis bounced back to post the best record in the Major Leagues in 2004, tallying their most wins (105) since the 1940s.  Facing off against division rival Houston in the <a href="/wiki/2004_National_League_Championship_Series" id="w">NLCS</a>, the Cardinals took a 2-0 lead, then lost three straight in Houston. Coming home for Game 6, the Cardinals took a 4-3 lead into the 9th inning, but Houston tied it up. <a href="/wiki/Jim_Edmonds" id="w">Jim Edmonds</a> hit a walk-off homer in the bottom of the 12th to win the game. The next night, <a href="/wiki/Scott_Rolen" id="w">Scott Rolen</a>&#39;s two-run homer off <a href="/wiki/Roger_Clemens" id="w">Roger Clemens</a> won the series and gave the Cardinals their first NL pennant in seventeen years.  Albert Pujols was named the series MVP. </p>
<p>The Cardinals played the <a href="/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox" id="w">Boston Red Sox</a> in the <a href="/wiki/2004_World_Series" id="w">2004 World Series</a>. This was the third time the two teams have faced each other in the Fall Classic, with the Cardinals winning the previous two in 1946 and 1967, but this Series would be very different.  The Cardinals were swept by the Red Sox in four games, with Boston winning their first World Series championship in 86 years. The best demonstration of St. Louis&#39; troubles in the Series: <a href="/wiki/Albert_Pujols" id="w">Albert Pujols</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scott_Rolen" id="w">Scott Rolen</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jim_Edmonds" id="w">Jim Edmonds</a>, the normally fearsome 3-4-5 hitters for the Cardinals, were a dismal 6-for-45 with 1 RBI.</p>
<p>The 2005 Cardinals had another excellent season, winning 100 games and clinching their fourth NL Central championship (and fifth playoff berth) in the last six years.  However, they again fell short, losing the <a href="/wiki/2005_National_League_Championship_Series" id="w">NLCS</a> to Houston despite Albert Pujols&#39; memorable ninth inning three-run homer to win Game 5.</p>
<p>That offseason, <a href="/wiki/Chris_Carpenter" id="w">Chris Carpenter</a> won the Cy Young award and Albert Pujols won the NL MVP award. This made the Cardinals the first NL team since the 1991 Braves to have two players from the same team win both of these awards the same year.</p>
<a id="2006:_World_Series_Champs_Again" name="2006:_World_Series_Champs_Again"></a><h4>2006: World Series Champs Again</h4>

<p>In 2006, the Cardinals, fresh off their second 100-win season in a row, moved into the third facility to bear the name <a href="/wiki/Busch_Stadium" id="w">Busch Stadium</a> and were predicted to be preseason contenders for World Series champions by many in the media. <a class="externallink" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/preview06/news/story?page=06expertpicks" rel="nofollow" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/preview06/news/story?page=06expertpicks">http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/preview06/news/story?page=06expertpicks</a>  However, injuries plagued regulars Scott Rolen, Mark Mulder, Jason Isringhausen, and Jim Edmonds caused many to doubt the Redbirds could reach the playoffs, let alone win their 10th championship.  But weak seasons from the rest of the NL Central allowed the Cardinals to back into the playoffs for the fifth time in six seasons.  The Cardinals took the division lead on May 12, 2006 and never relinquished it, despite playing under .500 (35-37) after the All Star break.  On September 20, the Cardinals were seven games in first place in the Central, then proceeded to lose nine of the next 12 games.  The resurgent Houston Astros climbed all the way to within half a game of first before falling short of claiming the division.  </p>
<p>With the horrible play down the stretch as well as the injuries to the roster, the Cardinals were not expected to compete in the playoffs.  However, the Cardinals easily beat the San Diego Padres in the first round of the playoffs, 3 games to 1.  Ace Chris Carpenter won two games, including the clincher in St. Louis and posted a 2.02 ERA against the Padres, while a young, untested bullpen without closer Jason Isringhausen worked thirteen and a third scoreless innings.  </p>
<p>The second round of the playoffs began in New York, against the NL&#39;s winningest team, the Mets.  This time, the Cardinals pulled out a dramatic seven game win on the backs of several unlikely heroes.  Jeff Suppan was named NLCS MVP, and So Taguchi and Yadier Molina combined for two ninth-inning home runs (Taguchi&#39;s off of Mets closer Billy Wagner, and Molina&#39;s off of Aaron Heilman).  Scott Rolen was benched for Game 4 of the series after receiving a cortisone injection in his surgically-repaired shoulder after missing the last game of the NLDS.  This brought to light a long-simmering feud between Rolen and manager Tony La Russa <a class="externallink" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2006/news/story?id=2624812" rel="nofollow" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2006/news/story?id=2624812">http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2006/news/story?id=2624812</a>, but also fueled a Rolen resurgence.  After the benching, Rolen finished out the postseason on an eight game hitting streak.  The Cardinals won Game 7 and the series when Adam Wainwright struck out Carlos Beltran looking with the bases loaded and a two run lead.  </p>
<p>Going to the World Series, the Detroit Tigers were heavily favored over the Cardinals, with Bob Nightengale of the USA Today going so far as to pick the Tigers to win the series in three games. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2006-10-20-tigers-scouting-report_x.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2006-10-20-tigers-scouting-report_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2006-10-20-tigers-scouting-report_x.htm</a>  However, the underdog Cardinals shocked baseball by easily beating the Tigers in five games.  The Series was not without controversy, as Kenny Rogers was spotted with what appeared to be pine tar on his pitching hand in his win in Game 2 but his victory proved to be the only one for the Tigers.  Detroit pitchers made a World Series record five errors in five games.  Shortstop David Eckstein was named World Series MVP and the Cardinals clinched their 10th World Championship in St. Louis, and their first in their brand new stadium.</p>
<a id="2007" name="2007"></a><h4> 2007 </h4>
<p>The Cardinals began the <a href="/wiki/2007_St._Louis_Cardinals_season" id="w">2007 season</a> defending their <a href="/wiki/2006_World_Series" id="w">2006 World Series</a> championship.

<li>For much of the last half of the 20th century, the Cardinals&#39; radio flagship was St. Louis powerhouse 1120 <a href="/wiki/KMOX" id="w">KMOX</a>-AM. Over the years such announcers as <a href="/wiki/Harry_Caray" id="w">Harry Caray</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jack_Buck" id="w">Jack Buck</a> (<a href="/wiki/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> honorees), the latter&#39;s son <a href="/wiki/Joe_Buck" id="w">Joe Buck</a>, and former Cardinal player <a href="/wiki/Mike_Shannon" id="w">Mike Shannon</a> broadcast games over KMOX and its affiliate network. In late <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, after the Cardinals organization purchased a controlling interest in rival station 550 <a href="/wiki/KTRS_(AM)" id="w">KTRS</a>-AM, it was announced that KTRS would become the team&#39;s new flagship station beginning with the <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> season.

<ul>
<li>Between 1960 and 1987, St. Louis was home to two big-league Cardinals teams, baseball and <a href="/wiki/American_football" id="w">football</a>. Sports fans and local news coverage got into the habit of saying &#34;the <i>Baseball</i> Cardinals&#34; or &#34;the <a href="/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals" id="w">&#39;&#39;Football&#39;&#39; Cardinals</a>&#34; to distinguish the two. Locals also got into the habit of using &#34;Redbirds&#34; to refer specifically to the baseball team. This nickname had been commonly used decades before the football team came to town. As a result, the Football Cardinals became known as the &#34;Gridbirds&#34; or the &#34;Big Red&#34;.</li></ul>

<a id="Radio_and_television" name="Radio_and_television"></a><h1>Radio and television</h1>
<p>In St. Louis, Cardinals games on radio can be heard over <a href="/wiki/KTRS_(AM)" id="w">KTRS</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Talk_radio" id="w">talk radio</a> station of which the team owns 50 percent.  <a href="/wiki/Mike_Shannon" id="w">Mike Shannon</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Rooney" id="w">John Rooney</a> alternate as <a href="/wiki/Play-by-play" id="w">play-by-play</a> announcers.  KTRS feeds the games to a network comprised of 115 stations, covering Missouri, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arkansas" id="w">Arkansas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indiana" id="w">Indiana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Iowa" id="w">Iowa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" id="w">Kentucky</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mississippi" id="w">Mississippi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oklahoma" id="w">Oklahoma</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tennessee" id="w">Tennessee</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to moving to KTRS in 2006, the Cardinals and <a href="/wiki/KMOX" id="w">KMOX</a> radio enjoyed a partnership that spanned over seven decades.  But the relationship ended after the 2005 season when <a href="/wiki/CBS_Radio" id="w">CBS Radio</a>, KMOX&#39;s parent company, and the Cardinals failed to reach terms on a new rights agreement, resulting in the team leaving the 50,000-watt <a href="/wiki/Clear_channel" id="w">clear channel</a> behemoth in favor of becoming part-owners of 5,000-watt KTRS. </p>
<p>On television, coverage is split between <a href="/wiki/Fox_Sports_Net" id="w">Fox Sports Net Midwest</a> and <a href="/wiki/KSDK" id="w">KSDK</a>, St. Louis&#39; <a href="/wiki/NBC" id="w">NBC</a> affiliate.  KSDK replaced <a href="/wiki/KPLR-TV" id="w">KPLR-TV</a> as the Cards&#39; over-the-air television broadcaster starting in the 2007 season.  KSDK and its predecessor, KSD-TV, previously carried the team from 1963 until 1987.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Joe_Buck" id="w">Joe Buck</a> and <a href="/wiki/Al_Hrabosky" id="w">Al Hrabosky</a> are the official announcers on FSN Midwest, though Buck&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Fox_Sports_(USA)" id="w">Fox Sports</a> commitments restrict him to only doing ten games per season; <a href="/wiki/Dan_McLaughlin" id="w">Dan McLaughlin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ricky_Horton" id="w">Ricky Horton</a> fill in when Joe Buck is unavailable.  Buck&#39;s father was Cardinals legend and Hall of Fame announcer <a href="/wiki/Jack_Buck" id="w">Jack Buck</a>.  <a href="/wiki/Jay_Randolph" id="w">Jay Randolph</a> and Horton team up for KSDK contests. All telecasts on KSDK will be in <a href="/wiki/HDTV" id="w">HDTV</a>, along with a select number on FSN Midwest.</p>
