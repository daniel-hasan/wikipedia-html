<p>Larrys Creek is the only major watershed in Lycoming County entirely within the county. Measured directly, Lycoming County is about 130&#160;miles (209&#160;km) northwest of <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" id="w">Philadelphia</a> and 165&#160;miles (266&#160;km) east-northeast of <a href="/wiki/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Pittsburgh</a>.).<sup id="_ref-distance_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-distance" title="">[8]</a></sup> It is 53.0&#160;miles (85.3&#160;km) from the mouth of Larrys Creek along the West Branch Susquehanna River to its confluence with the <a href="/wiki/Susquehanna_River" id="w">Susquehanna River</a> at <a href="/wiki/Northumberland%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Northumberland, Pennsylvania</a>.<sup id="_ref-river miles_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-river miles" title="">[9]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Source_(river_or_stream)" id="w">source</a> of Larrys Creek is in northern Lycoming County in <a href="/wiki/Cogan_House_Township%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Cogan House Township</a>, just south of the hamlet of Steam Valley, at an elevation of 1,740&#160;feet (530&#160;m)<sup id="_ref-usgs_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-usgs" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-source_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-source" title="">[10]</a></sup> It flows west-southwest through the village of Cogan House, and then under the <a href="/wiki/Cogan_House_Covered_Bridge" id="w">Cogan House Covered Bridge</a>. </p>
<p>The creek next heads due south through <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Game_Lands" id="w">Pennsylvania State Game Lands</a> Number 114. There it runs for about 3&#160;miles (5&#160;km) with only a trail or unimproved road beside it.<sup id="_ref-sgl map_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sgl map" title="">[11]</a></sup> It passes through <a href="/wiki/Mifflin_Township%2C_Lycoming_County%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Mifflin Township</a> for a short distance and heads southeast into <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Township%2C_Lycoming_County%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Anthony Township</a>, where it leaves the State Game Lands and passes a water filtration plant (there is a 6&#160;foot (2&#160;m) dam here).<sup id="_ref-canoe_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-canoe" title="">[3]</a></sup> Further south, it receives Roaring Run (on the <a href="/wiki/Left_bank" id="w">left bank</a>). Roaring Run receives the only acid mine drainage in the watershed and enters Larrys Creek 10.4&#160;miles (16.7&#160;km) from the mouth. </p>
<p>Larrys Creek then heads southwest back into Mifflin Township, where it passes through the borough of <a href="/wiki/Salladasburg%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Salladasburg</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania_Route_973" id="w">Pennsylvania Route 973</a> running parallel to the creek from the township line to the borough. At Salladasburg, Larrys Creek receives its major tributary, the Second Fork of Larrys Creek, on the <a href="/wiki/Right_bank" id="w">right bank</a> 5.8&#160;miles (9.3&#160;km) from the mouth. </p>
<p>The Second Fork rises in Cogan House Township near the village of White Pine and runs south through the village of Brookside, then a few miles through <a href="/wiki/Cummings_Township%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Cummings Township</a>, and last through Mifflin Township and Salladasburg. Lawshe Run is its major tributary. <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania_Route_287" id="w">Pennsylvania Route 287</a> runs parallel to the Second Fork its whole length, and continues parallel to Larrys Creek from Salladasburg south to its terminus on <a href="/wiki/U.S._Route_220" id="w">U.S. Route 220</a> (near the creek&#39;s mouth). </p>
<p>Just south of Salladasburg, Larrys Creek receives the First Fork of Larrys Creek, 4.2&#160;miles (6.8&#160;km) from the mouth. The First Fork has its source in Cummings Township and flows south-southeast into Mifflin Township. 2.8&#160;miles (4.5&#160;km) from its mouth Larrys Creek receives Canoe Run. Both these tributaries enter on the right bank.</p>
<p>Larrys Creek then enters Piatt Township, flowing east around a ridge and through the village of Larryville where it receives Seeley Run on the left bank, 1.5&#160;miles (2.4&#160;km) from the mouth. It next flows back southwest, then south to the hamlet of Larrys Creek and finally into the West Branch Susquehanna River, 2.6&#160;miles (4.2&#160;km) east of the borough of <a href="/wiki/Jersey_Shore%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Jersey Shore</a>, at an elevation of 515&#160;feet (157&#160;m).<sup id="_ref-usgs_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-usgs" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-mouth_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mouth" title="">[12]</a></sup> U.S. Route 220 and the <a href="/wiki/Lycoming_Valley_Railroad" id="w">Lycoming Valley Railroad</a> cross the creek on separate bridges just north of its mouth.<sup id="_ref-lycoming_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lycoming" title="">[7]</a></sup> The direct distance between the source and mouth is only 16.9&#160;miles (27.2&#160;km).<sup id="_ref-distance_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-distance" title="">[8]</a></sup> The difference in elevation between source and mouth, 1,225&#160;feet (373&#160;m), divided by the length of the creek, 22.9&#160;miles (36.9&#160;km), gives the average drop in elevation per unit length of creek or <a href="/wiki/Relief_ratio" id="w">relief ratio</a> of 53.5&#160;feet per mile (10.1&#160;m/km).

Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek served as an area for settlers to establish <a href="/wiki/Homesteading" id="w">homesteads</a> and farms.  As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek was a source of power for <a href="/wiki/Sawmills" id="w">sawmills</a> and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).<sup id="_ref-history_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek lead to the development of many small sawmills: the Larrys Creek watershed once had 53 sawmills within 22&#160;miles (35&#160;km) of the mouth (as well as other industries of the time). No other stream in the country had so many sawmills in so small a territory. Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on Canoe Run and Lawshe Run, and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. Eight were structures rebuilt on the site of previous sawmills, and only four were <a href="/wiki/Steam_power" id="w">steam powered</a> (the rest were <a href="/wiki/Water_power" id="w">water powered</a>). The earliest of these sawmills was built in 1796 (near Seeley Run), the last in 1902 (on Lawshe Run), and by 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating.<sup id="_ref-sawmills_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sawmills" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lumbering removed the tree trunks, but left many flammable limbs, branches, and stumps behind. On <a href="/wiki/May_2" id="w">May 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1872" id="w">1872</a> a large <a href="/wiki/Forest_fire" id="w">forest fire</a> destroyed the villages of Carter and Gould, 6&#160;miles (10&#160;km) north of Salladasburg on Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township.

<a id="Paper_railroads" name="Paper_railroads"></a><h2>Paper railroads</h2>
<p>Two &#34;paper railroads&#34; were proposed for Larrys Creek: the &#34;Larry&#39;s Creek Railroad and Coal Company&#34;, incorporated <a href="/wiki/June_24" id="w">June 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1839" id="w">1839</a> to hold 2,000&#160;acres (8&#160;km²) and operate up to 7&#160;miles (11&#160;km) of railroad from the mouth of the creek north to the coal mines; and the &#34;Jersey Shore, Pine Creek &#38; State Line Railroad&#34;, incorporated on <a href="/wiki/April_11" id="w">April 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1853" id="w">1853</a> to run north from Jersey Shore up Pine Creek to <a href="/wiki/Tioga%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Tioga</a> or Long Run, and thence to the <a href="/wiki/New_York-Pennsylvania_border" id="w">New York state line</a>. Its charter was amended <a href="/wiki/April_4" id="w">April 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1854" id="w">1854</a> to run up <a href="/wiki/Marsh_Creek_(Pine_Creek)" id="w">Marsh Creek</a> (then known as the Third Fork Pine Creek) and <a href="/wiki/Crooked_Creek_(Pennsylvania)" id="w">Crooked Creek</a> to the Tioga Railroad, and again on <a href="/wiki/March_26" id="w">March 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1856" id="w">1856</a> to run up Little Pine Creek (then known as First Fork Pine Creek) to the Larrys Creek Plank Road and then up Blockhouse Creek to <a href="/wiki/Blossburg%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Blossburg</a>. It was still an active corporation in 1865, but the charter of the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Jersey_Shore%2C_Pine_Creek_and_Buffalo_Railway" id="w">Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway</a>&#34; in 1870 (New York City-Reading interests) superseded it.

<div class="thumbcaption">Diagram of a plank road or puncheon.</div></p>
<p>In 1851 a <a href="/wiki/Plank_road" id="w">plank road</a> or puncheon was built along Larrys Creek from the village of Larrys Creek at the creek&#39;s mouth north to Salladasburg, then later along the Second Fork and on to the village of Brookside in Cogan House Township. It was later extended north to the village of White Pine and finally to the village of English Center in <a href="/wiki/Pine_Township%2C_Lycoming_County%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Pine Township</a> (along the current course of <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania_Route_287" id="w">Pennsylvania Route 287</a>). A spur of the plank road along Larrys Creek into Anthony Township was also built, but it is not known how far it extended.<sup id="_ref-plank_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-plank" title="">[48]</a></sup>  (Landis claims it may have run nearly as far north as the covered bridge in Cogan House Township).<sup id="_ref-now and then_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-now and then" title="">[49]</a></sup>
The plank road was a <a href="/wiki/Toll_road" id="w">toll road</a> run by &#34;The Larrys Creek Plank Road Company&#34;, a corporation founded <a href="/wiki/May_8" id="w">May 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1850" id="w">1850</a>. It served the sawmills, grist mills, mines, and leather tanneries along the creek. There was a connection to the railroad and the <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania_Canal_(West_Branch_Division)" id="w">West Branch Division of the Pennsylvania Canal</a> at the hamlet of Larrys Creek, as well as the West Branch Susquehanna River.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Tsuga" id="w">Hemlock</a> logs were used to build the plank road. At that time, the tree&#39;s bark was a major source of <a href="/wiki/Tannin" id="w">tannin</a> used to <a href="/wiki/Tanning" id="w">tan</a> leather. The wood was not used much for lumber, so hundreds of thousands of stripped hemlock logs were normally left to rot. There were sawmills and experienced lumber workers available from the local timber industry.</p>
<p>The earth under the plank road was first graded, then ties (similar to those used for railroad tracks) were set into the ground. Next long narrow stringers (similar to rails on a railroad track) were nailed to the ties, with a distance between stringers of about 6&#160;feet (1.8&#160;m). The road surface consisted of planks about 8&#160;feet (2.4&#160;m) wide nailed to the stringers and was fairly smooth. The road had turnoffs (as it was not wide enough for horse drawn vehicles to pass each other). <a href="/wiki/Toll_house" id="w">Toll houses</a> were at regular intervals, with variable tolls for pedestrians, riders on horseback and various carts and wagons. No toll schedule has survived.</p>
<p>The plank road was operational for about 38 years when a major flood on <a href="/wiki/June_1" id="w">June 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1889" id="w">1889</a> washed out much of it. The flood also destroyed the canal at the creek&#39;s mouth. The same storm system caused the <a href="/wiki/Johnstown_Flood" id="w">Johnstown Flood</a>, which killed over 2200 people.<sup id="_ref-history_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history" title="">[1]</a></sup> The Cogan  House Covered Bridge was the only one on Larrys Creek to survive the flood, as a fallen tree formed a protective dam just upstream.<sup id="_ref-now and then_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-now and then" title="">[49]</a></sup> The 90&#160;foot (27&#160;m) long <a href="/wiki/Burr_truss" id="w">Burr arch truss</a> bridge was built in 1877, listed on the <a href="/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places" id="w">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1980, rehabilitated in 1998, and is today one of just three left in the county.<sup id="_ref-arch_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-arch" title="">[50]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-register_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-register" title="">[51]</a></sup> </p>

By then most of the original forests in the county had been clear-cut, so no cheap source of wood was available as before. While the road from Salladasburg south to the West Branch Susquehanna River was repaired and rebuilt, the rest was not. In 1900 the county courts recognized a <a href="/wiki/Petition" id="w">petition</a> to end tolls on this last portion of the road. The corporation was dissolved and the road and its maintenance passed to the county. As sections of plank road wore out they were replaced by <a href="/wiki/Dirt_road" id="w">graded dirt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gravel_road" id="w">gravel</a>, so that it soon became a regular road. The plank road operated as a toll road for about 49 years.<sup id="_ref-plank_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-plank" title="">[48]</a></sup> Today only the &#34;Plank Road&#34; name survives, in a 0.6&#160;mile (1&#160;km) section of road that runs north from <a href="/wiki/U.S._Route_220_(Pennsylvania)" id="w">U.S. Route 220</a>, parallel to Route 287.<sup id="_ref-lycoming_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lycoming" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
