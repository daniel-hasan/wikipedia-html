<a id="Government_backbencher" name="Government_backbencher"></a><h3>Government backbencher</h3>

<p>While Baird had previously been associated with moderate Tories such as Timbrell and Beatty, he became associated with the more right-wing ideology of the <a href="/wiki/Mike_Harris" id="w">Mike Harris</a>-led Ontario PC party upon entering provincial politics.  He was first elected to the Ontario legislature in <a href="/wiki/Ontario_general_election%2C_1995" id="w">1995</a>, defeating <a href="/wiki/Ontario_Liberal_Party" id="w">Liberal</a> incumbent <a href="/wiki/Hans_Daigeler" id="w">Hans Daigeler</a> in the Ottawa-area riding of <a href="/wiki/Nepean_(electoral_district)" id="w">Nepean</a>.

<a id="Community_and_Social_Services_minister" name="Community_and_Social_Services_minister"></a><h3>Community and Social Services minister</h3>

<p>Baird joined Premier Harris&#39;s cabinet on <a href="/wiki/June_17" id="w">June 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a> as <a href="/wiki/Ontario_Minister_of_Community_and_Social_Services" id="w">Minister of Community and Social Services</a>, where he became responsible for implementing and expanding Ontario&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Workfare" id="w">workfare</a> program. <sup id="_ref-baird0105_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baird0105" title="">[12]</a></sup>As one of Harris&#39;s few <a href="/wiki/Bilingual" id="w">bilingual</a> ministers, he was also named as <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Francophone_Affairs" id="w">Minister responsible for Francophone Affairs</a>. <sup id="_ref-BairdLegislatureOntario_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BairdLegislatureOntario" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="1999" name="1999"></a><h4>1999</h4>

<p>Baird&#39;s first press conference as a cabinet minister was held in July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government&#39;s record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls.  Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure to argue that the government&#39;s policy was a success.  At the time, he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and he also did not account for 40% of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>A September 1999 report from Baird&#39;s ministry showed that 10,600 workfare placements had been created in the first six months of 1999, a figure which the <i><a href="/wiki/Toronto_Star" id="w">Toronto Star</a></i> observed was significantly lower than that which had been predicted by the government.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>  Baird indicated that he would continue with the workfare program, and that the proportion of welfare recipients on workfare would be increased from 15% to 30%.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Baird came under criticism in late 1999 for refusing to cancel a five-year contract that had been signed between his department and the <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a>-based private firm <a href="/wiki/Andersen_Consulting" id="w">Andersen Consulting</a> (later <a href="/wiki/Accenture" id="w">Accenture</a>), worth up to $180 million.  The contract, signed when <a href="/wiki/Janet_Ecker" id="w">Janet Ecker</a> was Community and Social Services minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province&#39;s welfare management system.  The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General <a href="/wiki/Erik_Peters" id="w">Erik Peters</a>, who observed that there was nothing in the contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>  A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work that had previously been done by ministry staff at $51 per hour.  Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth of savings.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup>  In response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Baird opposed the Harris government&#39;s plan to amalgamate the city of Ottawa with neighboring municipalities, which was approved by the Legislature in 1999.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<a id="2000" name="2000"></a><h4>2000</h4>

<p>In January 2000, Baird unveiled a series of initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by the establishment of a welfare fraud hotline.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>  Three months later, he added that anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>  Critics of this approach suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>  In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Baird revealed a $50 million program in May 2000 to help people with <a href="/wiki/Developmental_disabilities" id="w">developmental disabilities</a>  become integrated into their communities.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup>  He later affirmed that the province was considering closing its remaining three institutions for the mentally handicapped as part of a larger strategy focusing on home care.  Baird expressed concern about the physical condition of these institutions, saying that their residents &#34;deserve better&#34;.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Later in the year, Baird stated that his department would spend $26 million on shelters and other funding for the homeless. <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Baird supported mandatory drug-testing for welfare recipients and argued that those who refused such tests should be at risk of have their assistance cut off.  He introduced a policy initiative to this effect at a press conference in late 2000, in which he dramatically cast a box of <a href="/wiki/Syringe" id="w">syringes</a> onto the floor and said that his department planned to &#34;stop people from shooting their welfare cheque up their arm, and to help them shoot up the ladder of success&#34;.  Baird acknowledged that his department did not have reliable figures on the number of welfare recipients abusing drugs, although he cited estimates of between 4% and 10%.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> The proposal was met with criticism from several sources, and Ontario Human Rights Commissioner <a href="/wiki/Keith_Norton" id="w">Keith Norton</a>, himself a former Progressive Conservative cabinet minister, expressed concern that it could violate basic civil liberties.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shortly after Baird&#39;s announcement, a government website operated by the Ministry of Community and Social Services launched an attack against Liberal Party leader <a href="/wiki/Dalton_McGuinty" id="w">Dalton McGuinty</a> for opposing the drug testing plan.  The site claimed that McGuinty was &#34;opposed to helping welfare recipients who are addicted to drugs&#34;.  Baird denied that the message was partisan and initially refused to apologize.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup>  The <a href="/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Ontario_Legislature" id="w">Speaker of the Ontario Legislature</a> subsequently ruled that the site content was inappropriate and it was removed with an apology from the government.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup>  The drug-testing plan was never fully implemented.</p>
<a id="2001-02" name="2001-02"></a><h4>2001-02</h4>

<p>In early 2001, Baird announced that his government&#39;s proposed drug-testing plan would be extended to identify welfare recipients addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>  He later announced that provincial welfare applicants would be required to pass a literacy test.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> The Harris government&#39;s welfare policies were put under scrutiny in August 2001 after a pregnant woman in <a href="/wiki/Sudbury%2C_Ontario" id="w">Sudbury</a> died while serving a house arrest for welfare fraud.  The woman had been confined to her apartment for three months and reports indicated that her pregnancy was &#34;exacerbated by sweltering conditions in her apartment&#34;.  Responding to criticism, Baird said that he could not comment on the specifics of the case until a coroner&#39;s inquest was completed.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup>  He also defended his government&#39;s general policy on welfare issues.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup>  A subsequent inquest did not assign blame to the government for the woman&#39;s death, but recommended that lifetime bans for fraud be eliminated, and that adequate food, housing and medication be provided to anyone under house arrest.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup>
Baird was given additional responsibilities as <a href="/wiki/Minister_responsible_for_Children_(Ontario)" id="w">Minister responsible for Children</a> on February 8, 2001.  His department increased funding for child services early in the year, amid a significant increase in provincial demand.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>  In November 2001, the provincial media obtained a confidential government report recommending 40-45% cuts in provincial child-care programs.  Baird initially declined to comment on the document&#39;s contents, but rejected its proposals in early 2002.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>Baird was the first cabinet minister to support <a href="/wiki/Jim_Flaherty" id="w">Jim Flaherty</a>&#39;s campaign to succeed Mike Harris as Progressive Conservative Party leader in the party&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ontario_Progressive_Conservative_leadership_election%2C_2002" id="w">2002 leadership election</a>.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup>  The election was won by Flaherty&#39;s rival <a href="/wiki/Ernie_Eves" id="w">Ernie Eves</a>, and early media reports suggested that Baird might be dropped from the new premier&#39;s cabinet in April 2002.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup>  He was not, but was demoted to the position of <a href="/wiki/Chief_Government_Whip_(Ontario)" id="w">Chief Government Whip</a> while remaining associate minister for Francophone Affairs. His replacement in Social Services was <a href="/wiki/Brenda_Elliott" id="w">Brenda Elliott</a>, who was from the more centrist wing of the Progressive Conservative Party.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Energy_Minister_and_Government_House_Leader" name="Energy_Minister_and_Government_House_Leader"></a><h3>Energy Minister and Government House Leader</h3>

<p>Baird was returned to a more prominent cabinet position in August 2002 after Eves separated the ministries of <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_the_Environment_(Ontario)" id="w">Environment</a> and <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_Energy_(Ontario)" id="w">Energy</a> and appointed Baird to head the latter department. Baird was given additional responsibilities as <a href="/wiki/Government_House_Leader_(Ontario)" id="w">Government House Leader</a> in June 2003 after <a href="/wiki/Chris_Stockwell" id="w">Chris Stockwell</a> was forced to resign following allegations that he had used government funds for a family vacation.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> </p>
<p>As Energy Minister, Baird was initially entrusted with implementing the government&#39;s plan to sell off part of Ontario&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Hydro_One" id="w">Hydro One</a>.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup>  A few months later, he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals. The Energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late 2002 after hydro rates increased significantly in many parts of the province.  Critics argued that the Progressive Conservative government&#39;s price deregulation policy (implemented before Baird became Energy Minister) was responsible. Baird suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup>  Rates remained high through the autumn, and the Eves government was forced to re-regulate the market in November by introducing a price cap.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup>  The government continued to support deregulation in principle, but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office.  The second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late January 2003, when Premier Eves personally announced that Hydro One would remain under public control.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>Baird was regarded as less combative as Energy Minister than he had been in Community and Social Services.  The energy policies of the Eves government were controversial, but opposition criticism was often directed at the premier rather than at Baird.  Eves took a prominent interest in the Energy portfolio, and sometimes relegated Baird to a secondary role in policy announcements. <sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup>  In November 2002, however, he was followed around the province by &#34;Hydrozilla&#34;, a man in a giant lizard suit sent by the <a href="/wiki/Ontario_New_Democratic_Party" id="w">NDP</a> as a stunt to show that deregulating electricity rates would create an economic monster for consumers. <sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> In early March 2003, Baird announced that the government might be forced to implement rolling blackouts as a response to energy shortages.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup>  He encouraged conservation in late summer 2003, following a province-wide blackout caused by a generator failure in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" id="w">United States</a>.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Ontario Liberal Party won a <a href="/wiki/Majority_government" id="w">majority government</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Ontario_general_election%2C_2003" id="w">2003 election</a>, although Baird was comfortably re-elected in his own seat.  Between 2003 and 2005, he served as <a href="/wiki/Official_Opposition" id="w">Official Opposition</a> critic for Finance, Culture, Francophone Affairs, Intergovernmental Affairs and Health.  He opposed the imposition of a health premium by <a href="/wiki/Dalton_McGuinty" id="w">Dalton McGuinty</a>&#39;s government in 2004, charging that the Liberals broke an election pledge not the raise taxes. Baird and New Democrat <a href="/wiki/Peter_Kormos" id="w">Peter Kormos</a> were vocal critics of Speaker <a href="/wiki/Alvin_Curling" id="w">Alvin Curling</a> for allegedly favouring his Liberal colleagues, saying that he sanctioned Conservative and NDP members for behaviour he would allow from Liberals.

<p>Baird co-chaired Jim Flaherty&#39;s second campaign to lead the Progressive Conservative party in the <a href="/wiki/Ontario_Progressive_Conservative_leadership_election%2C_2004" id="w">2004</a>.

<p>Baird won a contested nomination battle for <a href="/wiki/Ottawa_West%E2%80%94Nepean" id="w">Ottawa Westâ€”Nepean</a> Conservative nomination on May 5, 2005, defeating challengers Ed Mahfouz, <a href="/wiki/Margret_Kopala" id="w">Margret Kopala</a> and Ade Olumide.  <a href="/wiki/John_Pacheco" id="w">John Pacheco</a>, a leader in the <a href="/wiki/Social_conservative" id="w">social conservative</a> movement against <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Canada" id="w">same-sex marriage</a>, had also sought the nomination but was disqualified due to past comments he had made alleging that <a href="/wiki/Homosexual" id="w">homosexual</a> practices posed a health risk.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> Pacheco later campaigned in the election as an &#34;Independent conservative,&#34; with the specific intent of being a <a href="/wiki/Spoiler" id="w">spoiler</a> against Baird.  He argued that if his campaign caused Baird to lose, the Conservatives would &#34;get the message that social conservatives are serious about their politics.&#34;<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup>  Baird chose to ignore Pacheco entirely in at least one all-candidates debate.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Baird was elected, defeating Liberal candidate <a href="/wiki/Lee_Farnworth" id="w">Lee Farnworth</a> by about 5,000 votes.  The <i>Ottawa Citizen</i> endorsed Baird in this campaign, and argued that his political judgment had improved considerably since his tenure as a Harris cabinet minister.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup>  In December 2006, Baird was one of thirteen Conservative MPs who voted against reopening the national debate on same-sex marriage.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>Baird has played an aggressive role in <a href="/wiki/Question_Period" id="w">Question Period</a> since his appointment to cabinet, leading MP <a href="/wiki/Garth_Turner" id="w">Garth Turner</a> to describe him as Stephen Harper&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons" id="w">Commons</a> pit bull&#34;.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<a id="President_of_the_Treasury_Board" name="President_of_the_Treasury_Board"></a><h3>President of the Treasury Board</h3>

<p>Baird was appointed President of the Treasury Board on February 6, 2006, a position that placed him in charge of the federal public service.  Following his appointment, Baird said that one of his priorities would be to prevent government jobs from being relocated from Ottawa to other regions for political purposes.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup>  He also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> In June 2006, Baird announced the creation of a three-member panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues.  One of the members was <a href="/wiki/Frances_Lankin" id="w">Frances Lankin</a>, a former <a href="/wiki/New_Democratic_Party_of_Ontario" id="w">New Democratic Party of Ontario</a> cabinet minister.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Accountability_Act" name="Accountability_Act"></a><h4>Accountability Act</h4>

<p>Baird introduced the Conservative government&#39;s first piece of legislation in April 2006.  Known as the &#34;Accountability Act,&#34; the bill includes 317 sections and promises significant reform to the structure of Canadian politics and government.  Prime Minister Harper said that it would &#34;put an end to the influence of money&#34; in the Canadian government.  The Accountability Act restricts the ability of former politicians and bureaucrats to become lobbyists, provides protection to whistle-blowers in the civil service and gives the <a href="/wiki/Auditor_General_of_Canada" id="w">Auditor General of Canada</a> new powers of oversight.  It also limits individual donations to political parties and candidates to $1,000 per year (down from $5,200), creates nine new or revised positions to oversee the activities of public officials and places crown corporations such as the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation" id="w">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> under access-to-information legislation.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>Opposition MPs complained that several recommendations for access-to-information reform were left out of the bill, and were instead sent to committee for further review.  <a href="/wiki/New_Democratic_Party" id="w">New Democratic Party</a> MP <a href="/wiki/Pat_Martin" id="w">Pat Martin</a> initially suggested that this deferral could delay meaningful reform for the foreseeable future.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup>  Martin later made a deal with Baird to give the bill an easy passage through committee, in return for the Conservatives accepting some NDP amendments.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup></p>
<p>Information Commissioner <a href="/wiki/John_Reid_(Canadian_politician)" id="w">John Reid</a> has criticized the new proposed powers for his department under the legislation, arguing that they will create unnecessary bureaucracy.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup>  Shortly after the Accountability Act was introduced to parliament, Reid issued an emergency report saying that the legislation would &#34;increase the government&#39;s ability to cover up wrongdoing, shield itself from embarrassment and control the flow of information to Canadians&#34;.  He added that no government had ever put forward &#34;a more retrograde and dangerous&#34; set of proposals for dealing with access to information laws.  Baird described Reid&#39;s criticisms as &#34;excessive,&#34; saying that most of the commissioner&#39;s specific concerns were minor in nature.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup>  Representatives of Canada&#39;s business community also expressed concern about changes to disclosure laws, arguing that their commercial secrets could be exposed to competitors.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The bill passed the House of Commons on division in June 2006.  The <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Senate" id="w">Canadian Senate</a> approved it in December 2006, with several amendments, and sent it back to the Commons for further consideration.  The amended act was approved by the Commons without debate on 8 December,<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> and was signed into law four days later. <sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shortly after the bill first passed the Commons, Baird acknowledged that the Conservatives may have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in 2005.  He told a Senate committee that $1.7 million was left unreported and that he did not realize it was an issue at the time.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup>  The matter is currently under review by the Chief Electoral Officer.  The Conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the Accountability Act in November 2006, stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Program_cuts" name="Program_cuts"></a><h4>Program cuts</h4>

<p>In May 2006, Baird was asked to find $1 billion in cuts for 2006 and 2007.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup>  On September 25, on the same day that the government announced a $13.2 billion surplus, Baird announced cuts to sixty-six federal programs, including Status of Women, medicinal marijuana research, Canadian museums, adult literacy, youth employment and social development and the British Columbia pine beetle program.  One of the most controversial cuts was to the federal Court Challenges Program, which provides funding for Canadians to pursue rights cases in the Canadian court system.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup>  Some critics argued that the cuts were ideological in nature, and would adversely affect the most vulnerable Canadians.  Baird argued that government funding would be redirected in a way that &#34;reflects the priorities of working families&#34; and that he &#34;just [didn&#39;t] think it made sense for the government to subsidize lawyers to challenge the government&#39;s own laws in court.&#34;<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup>  In justifying cuts to adult literacy programs, Baird referenced his government&#39;s support for youth literacy and said, &#34;We&#39;ve got to fix the ground level problem and not be trying to do repair work after the fact.&#34;<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>
<a id="2006_Ottawa_municipal_election" name="2006_Ottawa_municipal_election"></a><h4>2006 Ottawa municipal election</h4>

<p>In early October 2006, Baird&#39;s department reviewed a promised $200 million grant to the City of Ottawa&#39;s <a href="/wiki/O-Train" id="w">light-rail expansion</a> project.  Baird indicated that the government would keep the funding at least until the November election, but added that the Council elected in November will have the final say on the issue.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup>  He also leaked details of the city&#39;s contact with the German firm <a href="/wiki/Siemens" id="w">Siemens</a>.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup>  As a result, the rail program became a focal issue in the <a href="/wiki/Ottawa_municipal_election%2C_2006" id="w">2006 Ottawa mayoral election</a> and Baird&#39;s opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup>  Baird and Ottawa Mayor <a href="/wiki/Bob_Chiarelli" id="w">Bob Chiarelli</a> accused one another of lying about details of the project<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup>, and Liberal MP <a href="/wiki/Navdeep_Bains" id="w">Navdeep Bains</a> asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird&#39;s decision to release details of the private contract. <sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup>  Chiarelli was defeated in the election and the light-rail expansion was stopped by the new council.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>An <i><a href="/wiki/Ottawa_Citizen" id="w">Ottawa Citizen</a></i> report in January 2007 revealed that federal officials had not posed any objections to the light-rail project before Baird&#39;s intervention, and suggested that his involvement was political in nature.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Green_Party_of_Canada" id="w">Green Party</a> leader <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_May" id="w">Elizabeth May</a> speculated that Ottawa may have been deprived of light-rail service because of an apparent &#34;personal vendetta&#34; from Baird against Chiarelli.  Baird denied this charge, saying that his intervention was not political.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup>  Opponents of the light-rail project have argued that it was undertaken without sufficient consultation with the public.</p>
<a id="Other_responsibilities" name="Other_responsibilities"></a><h4>Other responsibilities</h4>

<p>Baird holds ministerial responsibilities for the Toronto Harbourfront Centre and the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup>  He developed a working relationship with <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_Toronto" id="w">Toronto Mayor</a> <a href="/wiki/David_Miller_(mayor_of_Toronto)" id="w">David Miller</a> soon after his appointment, and was present for the announcement of a comprehensive new waterfront strategy in June 2006.  Ontario cabinet minister <a href="/wiki/David_Caplan" id="w">David Caplan</a> has described Baird as a champion of waterfront renewal and David Miller has described him as an ally of the city.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup> Baird spent <a href="/wiki/Christmas" id="w">Christmas</a> 2006 meeting with Canadian soldiers in <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" id="w">Afghanistan</a>.<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Environment_Minister" name="Environment_Minister"></a><h3>Environment Minister</h3>

<p>On January 4, 2007, Baird was appointed as <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_the_Environment_(Canada)" id="w">Environment Minister</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_shuffle" id="w">cabinet shuffle</a>, replacing previous Minister <a href="/wiki/Rona_Ambrose" id="w">Rona Ambrose</a>.  In making the appointment, Prime Minister Stephen Harper acknowledged that his government needed to do more to make the environment a priority.<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup>  Some commentators remarked favourably on Baird&#39;s appointment, describing him as a strong communicator and negotiator.<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Coyne" id="w">Andrew Coyne</a>, however, described Baird as &#34;the man sent to kill the issue,&#34; suggesting that Baird&#39;s appointment was meant to neutralize the environment as an election issue rather than to initiate any meaningful reforms.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup>  Baird is a vocal opponent of the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" id="w">Kyoto Protocol</a>, which he argues will bring about an &#34;economic collapse&#34;.<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup>  Later in 2007, he added that any new environmental agreements must included reduction targets for major greenhouse emitters such as China, India and the United States who have not signed the Protocol or does not have any mandatory reductions set by the Protocol. <sup id="_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#_note-96" title="">[96]</a></sup> Baird met with renowned Canadian environmentalist <a href="/wiki/David_Suzuki" id="w">David Suzuki</a> following his appointment.

<a id="Approach_to_the_Kyoto_Protocol" name="Approach_to_the_Kyoto_Protocol"></a><h4>Approach to the Kyoto Protocol</h4>

<p>In February 2007, the Liberal opposition brought forward a non-binding motion for Canada to renew its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol.  All Conservative MPs who were present in the House, including Baird, voted against the motion, which passed with the support of the three opposition parties.<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup>  The following month, opposition members on a special Commons committee used their majority to bring forward sweeping changes to the government&#39;s Clean Air Act.  Among other things, the revised act called for participation in international carbon markets and the fulfillment of Kyoto targets.<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup>  Baird indicated that the opposition&#39;s changes would not be included in federal targets or regulations.<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[101]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In April 2007, Baird produced a federal study supported by five independent economists to support his approach to the Kyoto Protocol.  Among the five economists was <a href="/wiki/Toronto-Dominion_Bank" id="w">Toronto-Dominion Bank</a> chief economist <a href="/wiki/Don_Drummond" id="w">Don Drummond</a>, who also wrote a private letter to Baird arguing that the &#34;economic cost [of implementing Kyoto] would be at least as deep as the recession in the early 1980s.&#34;<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup> Opposition parliamentarians dismissed the report as a scare tactic, while Liberal Environment Critic <a href="/wiki/David_McGuinty" id="w">David McGuinty</a> argued that the study was misleading, saying that it did not properly examine international emission trading and ignored jobs to be created through the &#34;green economy&#34;.<sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[103]</a></sup> The report misrepresented Canada&#39;s ability to invest in developing nations to meet emissions targets through CDM by misquoting the amount of credit to be 85 million instead of the real approximation of 3 billion.<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[104]</a></sup>  Soon after, a <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a> report also contradicted the study mentioning that &#34;steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions can be accomplished at a cost of only 0.12 per cent of the world&#39;s annual economic output&#34; but Baird responded that Canada will have its gas emissions levels peaked in 2012 three years before the UN&#39;s set target of 2015. <sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Environmental_strategy" name="Environmental_strategy"></a><h4>Environmental strategy</h4>

<p>Baird was the Harper government&#39;s representative at the release of a major <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a> report on climate change in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> in February 2007.  He described the report as a &#34;turning point in the battle against climate change,&#34; while indicating his surprise that human activity was found to be a major cause of the phenomenon.<sup id="_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#_note-106" title="">[106]</a></sup></p>
<p>Baird released his government&#39;s targets for greenhouse gas emissions in late April 2007.  The plan calls for Canada to begin cutting its existing rate of greenhouse gas emissions by 2010 and for cuts to reach 20% by 2020.  Under this plan, Canada will reach its Kyoto targets between 2020 and 2025, taking an additional eight to thirteen years longer than Kyoto. The government plan uses production intensity targets instead of hard caps. Baird said that the &#34;plan strikes a balance between the perfection some environmentalists may be seeking and the status quo that some in industry seek to protect.&#34;<sup id="_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#_note-107" title="">[107]</a></sup> Later in December 2007, Baird revealed in a plan that over 700 big-polluter companies, including oil and gas, pulp and paper, electricity and iron and steel companies, must cut greenhouse  emissions by six percent from 2008 to 2010 The companies would also have to produce an annual report every May 31st that would include data regarding the level of greenhouses emissions produced each year. <sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[108]</a></sup>
Baird&#39;s proposal has been met with approval from Canada&#39;s oilpatch executives, who described them as the toughest emission regulations in the world, and who feared that more stringent standards would stifle oil sands exploration.<sup id="_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#_note-109" title="">[109]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#_note-110" title="">[110]</a></sup> Ontario Premier <a href="/wiki/Dalton_McGuinty" id="w">Dalton McGuinty</a> has been considerably less critical than his brother, having earlier written to Prime Minister Harper on the environmental policy. The Premier had stressed the importance of a policy that considered the North American market as a whole, due to the automotive industry&#39;s importance to his province. McGuinty said the Conservatives&#39; environmental plan could have gone further but described the auto emissions part of the plan as &#34;very sensible&#34;.<sup id="_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#_note-111" title="">[111]</a></sup></p>
<p>Members of opposition parties have criticized the government&#39;s abandonment of Kyoto goals, while <a href="/wiki/David_Suzuki" id="w">David Suzuki</a> described the proposal as a &#34;sham&#34; with &#34;weak targets&#34;.<sup id="_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#_note-112" title="">[112]</a></sup> Former US vice president <a href="/wiki/Al_Gore" id="w">Al Gore</a> said Baird&#39;s plan was a &#34;complete and total fraud&#34; that was &#34;designed to mislead the Canadian people&#34;.<sup id="_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#_note-113" title="">[113]</a></sup>  Baird responded by defending his plan and by criticizing Gore&#39;s environmental record, noting that no similarly stringent measures were passed during Gore&#39;s tenure in office and that the Kyoto Treaty was never submitted to the US Senate for ratification.<sup id="_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#_note-114" title="">[114]</a></sup> The Liberal Party, led by MP <a href="/wiki/Pablo_Rodriguez" id="w">Pablo Rodriguez</a>, introduced to the House of Commons a private bill that would have forced Canada to comply to the Kyoto Treaty in response to the government&#39;s plan. While the bill passed Baird mentioned that, even though that the government wouldn&#39;t dismiss it, there was no new environmental measures planned. <sup id="_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#_note-115" title="">[115]</a></sup> All three opposition parties have demanded that the environment becomes one of the main points of the government&#39;s Throne Speech in the 2007 fall session.<sup id="_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#_note-116" title="">[116]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Other_policy_initiatives" name="Other_policy_initiatives"></a><h4>Other policy initiatives</h4>

Baird and Lunn also announced a $230 million program for clean energy technology.  Lunn said that &#34;there were literally hundreds of programs but there was no focus&#34; when the Conservatives took office.<sup id="_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#_note-117" title="">[117]</a></sup>  Critics argued that the new Conservative measures were similar to measures introduced by the Liberals in their 2005 budget.<sup id="_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#_note-118" title="">[118]</a></sup>  Liberal leader <a href="/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Dion" id="w">StÃ©phane Dion</a> has argued that the Conservative Party&#39;s strategy is too strongly focused on <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_energy" id="w">nuclear energy</a>.<sup id="_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#_note-119" title="">[119]</a></sup></p>
<p>On 12 February 2007, Baird appeared at a press conference with Stephen Harper and <a href="/wiki/Premier_of_Quebec" id="w">Quebec Premier</a> <a href="/wiki/Jean_Charest" id="w">Jean Charest</a> to announce a $1.5 billion environmental fund for the provinces.<sup id="_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#_note-120" title="">[120]</a></sup>  Journalist Frances Russell criticized that as a reduction from the $3 billion promised by the previous Liberal government.<sup id="_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#_note-121" title="">[121]</a></sup></p>
<p>In March 2007, Baird indicated that he wanted Canadian companies to be banned, or at least severely restricted, from participating in the international carbon market.  Several European countries have already set up a trading system to allow companies that reduce their emission levels below government targets to sell &#34;credits&#34; on an international market.  Environmentalists and many industry leaders have argued that Canada should adopt a similar policy, and opposition leader <a href="/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Dion" id="w">StÃ©phane Dion</a> has argued that participation will allow Canadian firms to make &#34;megatonnes of money&#34;.  Baird described some carbon markets as &#34;shaky,&#34; and argued that trade should be restricted to within Canada, or perhaps within <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a>.<sup id="_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#_note-122" title="">[122]</a></sup>  In April, he indicated that Canadian businesses would soon gain the right to earn credits by investing in overseas environmental projects.<sup id="_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#_note-123" title="">[123]</a></sup></p>
<p>Baird defended the Conservative government&#39;s decision to cut funds for climate science research, arguing that further studies are largely superfluous in light of recent United Nations reports.  Gordon McBean of the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences has disagreed, claiming that further research is the best way to adapt to a changing climate.<sup id="_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#_note-124" title="">[124]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#_note-125" title="">[125]</a></sup></p>
