<p><b>Sōshi-kaimei</b> (<a href="/wiki/Japanese_language" id="w">Japanese</a>: 創氏改名) was a policy created by <a href="/wiki/Jiro_Minami" id="w">Jiro Minami</a>, <a href="/wiki/Governor-General_of_Korea" id="w">Governor-General of Korea</a> under the <a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" id="w">Empire of Japan</a>, implemented upon <a href="/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule" id="w">Japanese subjects from Korea</a> (referred to below as <a href="/wiki/Koreans" id="w">Koreans</a>). As defined by Ordinance No. 19, issued in 1939, <i>sōshi</i>, literally &#34;creation of a <a href="/wiki/Family_name" id="w">family name</a> (氏, <i>shi</i>)&#34;, was mandatory because (according to Japanese logic) Korean family names were not family names but <a href="/wiki/Clan" id="w">clan</a> names (姓, <i>sei</i>) which indicate a person&#39;s father&#39;s origin, while by Ordinance No. 20, issued in 1940, <i>kaimei</i>, literally &#34;changing (your) given name&#34;, was voluntary and would be charged a fee.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> This was effectively a reversal of an earlier government order forbidding Koreans from taking Japanese names. There are various explanations as to the purpose of the ordinances.</p>
<a id="Order_No._124" name="Order_No._124"></a><h2> Order No. 124 </h2>

<p>In 1909, the <a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Korea" id="w">Empire of Korea</a>, on the basis of guidance from Japan, established a {{nihongo}}, starting the creation of a modern <a href="/wiki/Family_register" id="w">family registry</a> system. With regards to the recording of details about women such as the father&#39;s surname, age, and connection to the registry holder, due to attention that needed to be given to avoiding conflict with <a href="/wiki/Korean_name#Family names" id="w">Korean customs</a>, the drafting of the law was not completed until April 1910, just before the <a href="/wiki/Japan-Korea_Annexation_Treaty" id="w">annexation of Korea</a>. By that time, a portion of Koreans had already registered Japanese-style names and the like, which generated confusion. As a result, on the basis of memoranda such as Order No. 124, &#34;Document regarding name changes by Koreans&#34;<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> issued by the <a href="/wiki/Governor-General_of_Korea" id="w">Governor-General of Korea</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_11" id="w">November 11</a> <a href="/wiki/1911" id="w">1911</a>, the use by Koreans of &#34;names which might be mistaken for those of native Japanese&#34;<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> was no longer permitted, and strict controls were placed on the registration of Japanese-style names for newborn children. Additionally, Koreans who had registered Japanese-style names on their were required to revert to their original names.<sup id="_ref-Mizuno1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mizuno1" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Ordinances_No._19_and_20" name="Ordinances_No._19_and_20"></a><h2> Ordinances No. 19 and 20 </h2>
<p>In 1939 and 1940, a new name-change policy came into effect by means of Ordinances No. 19 and 20. Originally, as in <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" id="w">Taiwan</a>, the new name-change policy was intended simply to allow change of surname (<i>sei</i>/<i>seong</i>) and given name, but because Korea had a long-established custom (recently abandoned) whereby people of the same <i><a href="/wiki/Bon-gwan" id="w">bon-gwan</a></i> (surname and clan) were not allowed to marry each other, in order that this custom could continue, it was decided that the policy would be implemented by leaving the clan name and <i>sei</i> the same in the family register, while permitting a new family name (<i>shi</i>/<i>ssi</i>) to be registered. On the other hand, in Taiwan, which was also <a href="/wiki/Taiwan_under_Japanese_rule" id="w">under Japanese rule</a> in the same period, but did not have an analogous custom, the policy was not described as &#34;creation of a <i>shi</i>&#34;, but was simply &#34;change of <i>sei</i> and given name&#34; (改姓名).</p>
<p>With regards to the creation of a family name (<i>shi</i>), there were both &#34;<i>shi</i> created by (individual) selection&#34; (設定創氏) and &#34;<i>shi</i> created by law&#34; (法定創氏). In the half year between <a href="/wiki/February_11" id="w">February 11</a> and <a href="/wiki/August_10" id="w">August 10</a> <a href="/wiki/1940" id="w">1940</a>, those who provided notification could create a <i>shi</i> of their own choosing, while those who did not provide any notification would have their <i>shi</i> defined by the clan name (<i>sei</i>) of the head of the household. After the &#34;creation of a family name&#34;, a Korean had three names which are a family name <i>shi</i>, a clan name <i>sei</i>, and a personal name <i>mei</i> (first name), all of which are recorded in a person&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Family_register" id="w">family register</a> along with the origin place of the clan, <i><a href="/wiki/Bon-gwan" id="w">bon-gwan</a></i>. Since all members of a family share the same family name <i>shi</i>, wife&#39;s <i>shi</i>, and hence the first character in her legal name, would be the same as her husband&#39;s, which differed from the traditional Korean clan name <i>sei</i>, whereby a wife kept her original <i>sei</i> even after marriage (see <a href="/wiki/S%C5%8Dshi-kaimei#Timeline of family registration procedures in Korea" id="w">table</a>).<sup id="_ref-Cho_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cho" title="">[5]</a></sup> Besides that, selection of a <i>shi</i> with a Japanese-style reading could also be approved; to go along with such a <i>shi</i>, it was also permissible to change one&#39;s given name to a Japanese-style name; as the change of given name was voluntary, a fee would be charged for it. Additionally, at the same time, the <i>mukoyōshi</i> system, i.e. an <a href="/wiki/Adoption" id="w">adoption</a> of daughter&#39;s husband, (<a href="/wiki/Ja:%E5%A9%BF%E9%A4%8A%E5%AD%90" id="w">婿養子制度</a>), which up until then had been forbidden under Korean law, was also introduced. This case was also included in the <i>sōshi-kaimei</i> policy.</p>
<p>Declaration of individually-selected <i>shi</i> and changes of given name initially (in February 1940) were conducted on the basis of voluntary notification. However, at the April prefectural governors&#39; meeting, because of instructions such as &#34;Special consideration should be taken so that the <i>shi</i> registration of all households can be completed by the coming <a href="/wiki/July_20" id="w">July 20</a>&#34;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> the administration began to seriously promote the policy, and as a result, starting from April, the number of households registering individually-selected <i>shi</i> began to rise sharply. As of April, only 3.9% of all households had provided notification for creation of a <i>shi</i>, but by <a href="/wiki/August_10" id="w">August 10</a>, that figure had risen to 80.3%. Also, statements opposing the policy of <i>sōshi-kaimei</i> were censored according to the internal security laws. </p>
<p>There are several viewpoints regarding this sudden increase. Most argue that official compulsion and harassment existed against individuals who would not create a new Japanese-style <i>shi</i>, but disagree whether this was the result of individual unauthorised practises by low-level officials , the policy of some regional government organisations, or an overall intention of the colonial government. Others argue that Koreans seeking to avoid discrimination by Japanese voluntarily created Japanese-style family names.</p>
<p>Regardless, of Koreans living in Korea, the proportion of those who changed their given name reached only 9.6%. Among Koreans living in the mainland of Japan, the proportion of those who created a new <i>shi</i> by individual selection reached 14.2％.</p>
