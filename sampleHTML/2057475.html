<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1> History </h1>

<p>The 15.7 acre site for the school was purchased in 1957 for Â£3,810 by <a href="/wiki/Hampshire_County_Council" id="w">Hampshire County Council</a>. Fleet Secondary Modern School, the earliest school in the town, moved into the site in 1960 and reopened as Court Moor School on May 11. At the time, the school had only buildings, 500 students and 20 teachers. Court Moor became a comprehensive school in 1974 and is part of the Hart school district.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The school is adjacent to the <a href="/wiki/Basingstoke_Canal" id="w">Basingstoke Canal</a> and part of its site is designated a nature conservation area. The school gate is narrow because it was originally intended to be the trade entrace. Local residents were worried about the consequences of having the intended main gate opening onto their estate and it was never widened.</p>
