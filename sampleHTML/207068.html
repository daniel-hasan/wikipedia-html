<p><b>Mu‘āwīyah ibn Abī Sufyān</b> ({{ArB}})&#8206; (<a href="/wiki/602" id="w">602</a>-<a href="/wiki/680" id="w">680</a>) was a companion of <a href="/wiki/Muhammad" id="w">Muhammad</a> and later the <a href="/wiki/Umayyad" id="w">Umayyad</a> <a href="/wiki/Caliph" id="w">caliph</a> in Damascus. He engaged in a civil war against the fourth and final <a href="/wiki/Rightly_Guided_Caliph" id="w">Rightly Guided</a> <a href="/wiki/Caliph" id="w">Caliph</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib" id="w">Ali</a> (<a href="/wiki/Muhammad" id="w">Muhammad</a>&#39;s son-in-law) and met with considerable military success, including the seizure of <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>.  He assumed the <a href="/wiki/Caliphate" id="w">caliphate</a> after Ali&#39;s assassination in <a href="/wiki/661" id="w">661</a> and reigned until <a href="/wiki/680" id="w">680</a>.</p>
<p>Because he opposed Ali, whom the <a href="/wiki/Shia" id="w">Shia</a> Muslims believe was <a href="/wiki/Muhammad" id="w">Muhammad</a>&#39;s true successor (see <a href="/wiki/Succession_to_Muhammad" id="w">Succession to Muhammad</a>), he has been hated and reviled by generations of Shi&#39;a. </p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Muawiyah ibn Abi-Sufyan was born (c. <a href="/wiki/600" id="w">600</a>) into a powerful clan, (<a href="/wiki/Banu_Abd_Shams" id="w">Banu Abd Shams</a>), of the  <a href="/wiki/Quraysh" id="w">Quraysh</a> tribe. The Quraysh controlled the city of <a href="/wiki/Mecca" id="w">Mecca</a>, in what is now western <a href="/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" id="w">Saudi Arabia</a>, and the Banu Abd-Shams were among the most influential of its citizens. Muawiyah&#39;s father  <a href="/wiki/Abu_Sufyan_ibn_Harb" id="w">Abu Sufyan ibn Harb</a> and mother <a href="/wiki/Hind_bint_Utbah" id="w">Hind bint Utbah</a> are famous individuals in their own right. </p>
<p>Many of the Abd-Shams opposed <a href="/wiki/Muhammad" id="w">Muhammad</a> when he was preaching his new faith in Mecca, and joined in the armed battles that followed the emigration of Muhammad and his followers to <a href="/wiki/Medina" id="w">Medina</a>. </p>
<p>In 630 CE, Muhammad and his followers conquered Mecca, and most of the Meccans, including the Abd-Shams, formally submitted to Muhammad and accepted Islam. General consensus among early Islamic historians is that Muawiyah along with his father Abu Sufyan became Muslims at the conquest of Mecca when further resistance to Muslims became an impossibility. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> According to some historians {{Who}}  Muāwiyya accepted <a href="/wiki/Islam" id="w">Islam</a> in defiance of his relatives.</p>
<p>Muhammad welcomed his former opponents, enrolled them in his army and gave them important posts in the expanding Islamic empire. After Muhammad&#39;s passing in 632, he served in the Islamic army sent against the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Byzantine</a> forces in present-day <a href="/wiki/Syria" id="w">Syria</a>. He held a high rank in the Muslim Army under his brother <a href="/wiki/Yazid" id="w">Yazid</a>, who was appointed governor of the newly conquered province.</p>
<a id="Governor_of_Syria" name="Governor_of_Syria"></a><h2> Governor of Syria </h2>
<p>Caliph <a href="/wiki/Umar_ibn_al-Khattab" id="w">Umar ibn al-Khattab</a> had appointed <a href="/wiki/Yazid_Ibn_Abu_Sufyan" id="w">Yazid Ibn Abu Sufyan</a> as governor of Syria. In the year 640 <a href="/wiki/Hijri" id="w">hijri</a>, Umar appointed Muawiyah, the brother of Yazid Ibn Abu Sufyan, as governor of Syria when the latter died due to an outbreak of plague. Muawiyah gradually gained mastery over the other areas of Syria, instilling remarkable personal loyalty among his troops and the people of the region. By <a href="/wiki/647" id="w">647</a>, Muawiyah had built a Syrian army strong enough to repel a Roman attack and, in subsequent years, to take the offensive against the Romans in campaigns that resulted in the capture of <a href="/wiki/Cyprus" id="w">Cyprus</a> (<a href="/wiki/649" id="w">649</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Rhodes" id="w">Rhodes</a> (<a href="/wiki/654" id="w">654</a>) and a devastating defeat of the Roman navy off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Lycia" id="w">Lycia</a> (<a href="/wiki/655" id="w">655</a>). At the same time, Muawiyah periodically dispatched land expeditions into <a href="/wiki/Anatolia" id="w">Anatolia</a>.</p>
<p>All these campaigns came to a halt with the accession of <a href="/wiki/Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib" id="w">Ali</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Caliphate" id="w">caliphate</a>, when a new and decisive phase of Muawiyah&#39;s career began.</p>
<a id="Conflict_with_Ali" name="Conflict_with_Ali"></a><h2> Conflict with Ali </h2>


<p>Muawiyah saught justice for the assassinated caliph <a href="/wiki/Uthman_ibn_Affan" id="w">Uthman ibn Affan</a>. <a href="/wiki/Aisha" id="w">Aisha</a> (Muhammad&#39;s widow), <a href="/wiki/Talha" id="w">Talha</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zubayr_ibn_al-Awwam" id="w">Zubayr ibn al-Awwam</a> were all in agreement with Muawiyah that the mischief mongers who assassinated Uthman should be brought to justice.  However, Ali refused to apprehend and punish Uthman&#39;s murderers citing rebel infiltration of the Muslim ranks resulting in Muawiyah&#39;s refusal to acknowledge Ali&#39;s caliphate{{Fact}}. However, Muawiyah did <i>not</i> participate in the Rebellion of <a href="/wiki/Aisha" id="w">Aisha</a>, <a href="/wiki/Talha" id="w">Talha</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zubayr_ibn_al-Awwam" id="w">Zubayr ibn al-Awwam</a> who went to war against Ali in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Bassorah" id="w">Battle of the Camel</a>. It should be noted that <a href="/wiki/Aisha" id="w">Aisha</a>, <a href="/wiki/Talha" id="w">Talha</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zubayr_ibn_al-Awwam" id="w">Zubayr ibn al-Awwam</a>, and Muawiyah did not want to cause muslim bloodshed <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>. The following few sentences from a speech made by <a href="/wiki/Aisha" id="w">Aisha</a> before the start of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Bassorah" id="w">Battle of the Camel</a> speak for themselves:</p>
<p><i>&#34;People used to find fault with Uthman and his officers. They would come to Madina and consult us. They understood whatever advice we gave them about keeping peace and order. When we considered the grievances they had against Uthman, we found Uthman innocent, God-fearing, and truthful, and these agitators, sinful, treacherous and liars. Their hearts concealed one thing whereas their lips gave utternace to another. When they gathered strength and entered the house of innocent Uthman without any just cause and shed blood which it was not lawful to shed. They plundered what it was not lawful to take. They desecrated the soil whose sanctity it was their duty to respect. Now listen! The work before us which it does not behove us to neglect is to arrest the assassins of Uthman and see that the law of God has its way&#34;.</i> {{Fact}} </p>
<p>The city of Basrah fell to <a href="/wiki/Aisha" id="w">Aisha</a>, <a href="/wiki/Talha" id="w">Talha</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zubayr_ibn_al-Awwam" id="w">Zubayr ibn al-Awwam</a>. Most of the mischief mongers{{Fact}} were rounded up and killed. It should be noted that those who were accomplices in the conspiracy and assassination of Uthman (including their leader Ibn Saba) had as their primary goal to undermine the power of Islam and were apparently espousing the cause of Ali. In reality, they had little sympathy for Ali either, as subsequent historic events show. Nonetheless, Ali was victorious and pardoned Aisha, had her escorted to Medina and allocated her a pension. <a href="/wiki/Talha" id="w">Talha</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zubayr_ibn_al-Awwam" id="w">Zubayr ibn al-Awwam</a> were killed in the Battle of the Camel.</p>
<p>Ali then turned towards Syria, which was in open revolt under her governor. He marched to the <a href="/wiki/Euphrates" id="w">Euphrates</a> and engaged Muawiyah&#39;s troops at the famous <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Siffin" id="w">Battle of Siffin</a> (<a href="/wiki/657" id="w">657</a>). Accounts of the clash vary -- however, it would seem that neither side had won a victory, since the Syrians called for an arbitration to settle the matters, arguing that continuing civil war would embolden the <a href="/wiki/Byzantines" id="w">Byzantines</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> There are several conflicting accounts of the arbitrations. In the meantime, dissension broke out in Ali&#39;s camp, when some former supporters, later known as <a href="/wiki/Kharijites" id="w">Kharijites</a>, felt that Ali had betrayed them by entering into negotiations. Ali set out to quell the Kharijites. At about the same time, unrest was brewing in Egypt and some of its citizens were demanding retribution for the blood of Uthman{{Fact}}. The governor of Egypt, Qais, was recalled and Ali had him replaced with Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr (the brother of <a href="/wiki/Aisha" id="w">Aisha</a> and the son of Islam&#39;s first Caliph Abu Bakr Sidiq). Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, a hot-headed man, was among the assassins of Uthman{{Fact}}. His heavey handed rule resulted in widespread rebellion in Egypt{{Fact}}. Seeing these events, Muawiyah ordered Amr ibn As to invade Egypt and was successful in doing so.</p>
<p>When Alī was assassinated by a Kharijite in <a href="/wiki/661" id="w">661</a>, Muawiyah held both Syria and Egypt and, as commander of the largest force in the Muslim Empire, had the strongest claim to the <a href="/wiki/Caliphate" id="w">Caliphate</a> {{Fact}}. Ali&#39;s son <a href="/wiki/Hasan_bin_Ali" id="w">Hasan</a>, after initial defiance of Muawiyah, ceased hostilities and retired to Medina, where he lived a quiet private life.</p>
<p>Sunni Muslims claim that Hasan pledged <a href="/wiki/Allegiance" id="w">allegiance</a> to Muawiyah. {{Fact}} Most Shi&#39;a Muslims say that he never pledged allegiance, merely ceased to advance his claim to the caliphate. This was done out of consideration for the supporters of Ali&#39;s family, who had been much reduced during the tumults of Ali&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Caliphate" id="w">caliphate</a>. {{Fact}}</p>
<a id="Rule" name="Rule"></a><h2> Rule </h2>
<p>After his accession to the position of Caliph by the year <a href="/wiki/661" id="w">661</a>, Muawiyah governed the geographically and politically disparate Caliphate, which spread from Egypt in the West to <a href="/wiki/Iran" id="w">Iran</a>  in the East, by strengthening the power of his allies in the newly conquered Arab territories. Prominent positions within the emerging governmental structures were held by Christians, some of whom belonged to families that had served in Byzantine governments. The employment of Christians was part of a broader policy of religious tolerance that was necessitated by the presence of large Christian populations in the conquered provinces, especially in Syria itself. This policy also boosted his popularity and solidified Syria as his power base. Muawiyah instituted several Byzantine-style bureaucracies, called <i><a href="/wiki/Diwan" id="w">diwans</a></i>, to aid him in the governance and the centralization of the Caliphate and the empire. Early Arabic sources credit two <i>diwan</i>s in particular to Muawiyah: the <i>Diwan al-Khatam</i> &#34;Chancellery&#34; and the <i>Barid</i> &#34;Postal Service&#34;, both of which greatly improved communications within the empire.  </p>
<p>Continuation of the naval campaign  against Rome was initially was very successful.
Among others, Chios and Smyrna were conquered and in 672 the base in <a href="/wiki/Cyzicus" id="w">Cyzicus</a>
was established. Muawiyah I, who had emerged as the ruling dynasty of the Arab empire following the civil war, besieged Constantinople under <a href="/wiki/Constantine_IV" id="w">Constantine IV</a>. In this battle, the Umayyads, unable to breach the Theodosian Walls, blockaded the city along the River Bosporus. The approach of winter forced the besiegers to withraw to an island 80 miles away.</p>
<p>Muawiyah died <a href="/wiki/May_6" id="w">May 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/680" id="w">680</a>. He was succeeded by his son <a href="/wiki/Yazid_I" id="w">Yazid I</a>. Muawiyah had held the expanding empire together by force of his personality, through personal allegiances, in the style of a traditional Arab <a href="/wiki/Shaykh" id="w">shaykh</a>. However Muawiyah&#39;s attempt to start a dynasty failed because both Yazid and then his grandson Muawiya II died prematurely. The caliphate eventually went to a descendant of another branch of his clan.</p>
<a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2> Legacy </h2>
<p>Caliph Muawiyah greatly beautified Damascus and developed a court to rival that of Constantinople. He expanded the frontiers of the empire, reaching the very gates of <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" id="w">Constantinople</a> at one point, though failing to hold any territory in <a href="/wiki/Asia_Minor" id="w">Asia Minor</a>. Sunni Muslims credit him with saving the fledgling Muslim nation from post civil war anarchy. </p>
<p>One of Caliph Muawiyah&#39;s most controversial and enduring legacies was his decision to designate his son Yazid as his successor, thereby the Caliphate became a <a href="/wiki/Dynasty" id="w">dynasty</a>. According to Shi&#39;a doctrine, this was a clear violation of the treaty he made with <a href="/wiki/Hasan" id="w">Hasan</a>, in which he said he would not make his son his successor.{{Fact}} He attempted to preserve the form of the election however, by causing his nobles and the chiefs of the empire to elect and swear allegiance to his son in his own lifetime, a tradition that endured for several succeeding dynasties. However the Shi&#39;ites were not an important factor in the resistance to Yazid which was led by <a href="/wiki/Abdullah_ibn_al-Zubayr" id="w">Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr</a>, the son of Zubayr ibn Awwam, the companion of Muhammad.</p>

<div class="caption">100px</div></p>
<p>Sunni historians see him as a companion of Muhammad, and worthy of respect although he fought the khalifa of the time <a href="/wiki/Ali" id="w">Ali</a>. Some view him as a fifth <a href="/wiki/Rightly_Guided_Caliph" id="w">Rightly Guided Caliph</a>.
</p><dl><dd><i>Allah, make him guided, a guider, and guide people through him.</i> <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>He is also favorably depicted in a hadith from <a href="/wiki/Bukhari" id="w">Bukhari</a> which reads:</p>
<p><i>..Muawiya who was really the best of the two men said to him, &#34;O &#39;Amr! If these killed those and those killed these, who would be left with me for the jobs of the public, who would be left with me for their women, who would be left with me for their children?&#34; Then Muawiya sent two Quraishi men from the tribe of &#39;Abd-i-Shams called &#39;Abdur Rahman bin Sumura and Abdullah bin &#39;Amir bin Kuraiz to Al-Hasan saying to them, &#34;Go to this man (i.e. Al-Hasan) and negotiate peace with him and talk and appeal to him.&#34; So, they went to Al-Hasan and talked and appealed to him to accept peace...&#34; </i><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sunni scholars rationalize that Hasan&#39;s willingness to abandon the caliphate to Muawiya suggests that Hasan did not think Muawiya an apostate, renegade, and hypocrite. They argue that Hasan did so with reasons such as for the sake of peace and not causing <a href="/wiki/Fitnah" id="w">Fitnah</a>, he gave it to muawiyah also for the reason that he had little support and muawiyah conquered most of the cities in the empire and The people of those cities ended up giving him bay&#39;ah. </p>
<p>Sunnis discourage criticizing Muawiya&#39;s character and rule, observing his status as a companion of Muhammad.</p>
<a id="Shi'a_view_of_Mu%C4%81wiyah" name="Shi'a_view_of_Mu%C4%81wiyah"></a><h2>Shi&#39;a view of Muāwiyah</h2>

<p>The Shi&#39;a tend to vilify Muawiyah. His supposed conversion to Islam before the conquest of Mecca is dismissed as a fable, or mere hypocrisy. He is said to have opposed Ali, the rightful <a href="/wiki/Caliph" id="w">Caliph</a>, out of sheer greed for power and wealth. His reign opened the door to unparalleled disaster, marked by persecution of Ali and his followers, resulting in <a href="/wiki/Yazid_I" id="w">Yazid I</a> coming into power, shortly followed by the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Karbala" id="w">Battle of Karbala</a>. He is said to have killed many of Muhammad&#39;s companions (Sahaba), either in battle or by poison, due to his lust for power. He is also accused of killing the children of <a href="/wiki/Ubaidullah" id="w">Ubaidullah</a></p>
<dl><dd><i>[...] Then he [i.e. Mu&#39;awiyah] was informed that Ubaidullah had two infant sons. So he set out to reach them, and when he found them - they had two (tender) forelocks like pearls - [and] he ordered to kill them.</i><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></dd></dl>
