&#34;<b>Doctorin&#39; the Tardis</b>&#34; ({{audio}}) is a <a href="/wiki/1988" id="w">1988</a> electronic <a href="/wiki/Novelty_record" id="w">novelty</a> pop <a href="/wiki/Single_(music)" id="w">single</a> by <b>The Timelords</b> (&#34;Time Boy&#34; and &#34;Lord Rock&#34;, aliases of <a href="/wiki/Bill_Drummond" id="w">Bill Drummond</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Cauty" id="w">Jimmy Cauty</a>, now better known as <a href="/wiki/The_KLF" id="w">The KLF</a>). The song is predominantly a <a href="/wiki/Bastard_pop" id="w">mash-up</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_theme_music" id="w">Doctor Who theme music</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gary_Glitter" id="w">Gary Glitter</a>&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_(Gary_Glitter_song)" id="w">Rock and Roll (Part Two)</a>&#34; with sections from &#34;<a href="/wiki/Blockbuster!" id="w">Blockbuster!</a>&#34; by <a href="/wiki/Sweet_(band)" id="w">Sweet</a>. The single was panned by critics but a commercial success, reaching number 1 in the <a href="/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart" id="w">UK Singles Chart</a> and charting in the Top 10 in <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Norway" id="w">Norway</a>.</p>
<p>The Timelords followed up their chart-topping record with a &#34;how to have a number one&#34; guide, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Manual" id="w">The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Context" name="Context"></a><h2>Context</h2>
<p>The release of &#34;Doctorin&#39; the Tardis&#34; followed a self-imposed break from recording of Drummond and Cauty&#39;s sampling outfit, <a href="/wiki/The_Justified_Ancients_of_Mu_Mu" id="w">The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu</a> (The JAMs). The single continued The JAMs&#39; strategy of plagiarising and juxtaposing popular musical works. However, unlike the <a href="/wiki/Cult_following" id="w">cultish</a> limited releases of The JAMs, in which Drummond&#39;s <a href="/wiki/River_Clyde" id="w">Clydeside</a> <a href="/wiki/Rapping" id="w">rapping</a> and social commentary were regular ingredients, &#34;Doctorin&#39; The Tardis&#34; was an excursion into the musical mainstream, with the change of name to &#34;The Timelords&#34; and an overt reliance on several iconic symbols of <a href="/wiki/1970s" id="w">1970s</a> and <a href="/wiki/1980s" id="w">80s</a> <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">British popular culture</a>, including Glitter, <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who" id="w">Doctor Who</a></i> (the theme song, and the references to <a href="/wiki/Dalek" id="w">Daleks</a> and the <a href="/wiki/TARDIS" id="w">TARDIS</a>), Sweet&#39;s &#34;Blockbuster!&#34; and <a href="/wiki/Harry_Enfield" id="w">Harry Enfield</a>&#39;s character &#39;Loadsamoney&#39;. The song also features the riff from another of Glitter&#39;s recordings, &#34;<a href="/wiki/I%26%2339%3Bm_the_Leader_of_the_Gang_(I_Am)" id="w">I&#39;m the Leader of the Gang (I Am)</a>&#34;. Its name is a reference to &#34;Doctorin&#39; the House&#34; by <a href="/wiki/Coldcut" id="w">Coldcut</a>.</p>
<p>Drummond and Cauty often claimed that the song was the result of a deliberate effort to write a number one hit single. However, in interviews with <i>SnubTV</i> and <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radio_1" id="w">BBC Radio 1</a>, Drummond offered a more plausible explanation. &#34;We went into the studio on a Monday, thinking we were going to make a house track, a regular underground dance house track using the Doctor Who theme tune... [but] we [then] realised it was in <a href="/wiki/Metre_(music)" id="w">triplet time</a> and you can&#39;t have house tracks in triplet time. The only beat that would work with it was the <a href="/wiki/Gary_Glitter" id="w">Glitter beat</a>. By Tuesday evening we realised we had a number one and we just went totally for the <a href="/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator" id="w">lowest common denominator</a>&#34;. Radio 1 interviewer <a href="/wiki/Richard_Skinner_(broadcaster)" id="w">Richard Skinner</a> called the record an &#34;aberration&#34;, to which Drummond pleaded &#34;guilty&#34;, adding that &#34;we justified it all by saying to ourselves &#39;We&#39;re celebrating a very British thing here... you know, something that <a href="/wiki/Timmy_Mallett" id="w">Timmy Mallett</a> understands&#39;&#34;.<sup id="_ref-skinner_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-skinner" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a KLF Communications information sheet, Drummond called &#34;Doctorin&#39; the Tardis&#34; &#34;probably the most nauseating record in the world&#34; but added that &#34;we also enjoyed celebrating the trashier side of pop&#34;.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

In promotional material for the single, credit for the talent behind the song (inspiration and authorship) was attributed not to Time Boy and Lord Rock but to Cauty&#39;s <a href="/wiki/1968" id="w">1968</a> <a href="/wiki/Ford_Galaxie" id="w">Ford Galaxie</a> American <a href="/wiki/Police_car" id="w">police car</a>, &#34;Ford Timelord&#34; (formerly known as the JAMsmobile). The car, which had previously appeared on the cover of The JAMs&#39; album <i><a href="/wiki/Who_Killed_The_JAMs%3F" id="w">Who Killed The JAMs?</a></i>, was thematically tailored to The JAMs, depicting their &#39;pyramid blaster&#39; emblem on its doors and the number <a href="/wiki/23_(numerology)" id="w">23</a> on its roof.  Drummond and Cauty claimed the car spoke to them, giving its name as Ford Timelord, and advising the duo to become &#34;The Timelords&#34;. Ford featured prominently on the sleeve of &#34;Doctorin&#39; the Tardis&#34;, where it is quoted as saying &#34;Hi! I&#39;m Ford Timelord. I&#39;m a car, and I&#39;ve made a record&#34;, and &#34;...I mixed and matched some tunes we all know and love, got some mates down and made this record. Sounds like a hit to me&#34;.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The &#34;Timelord&#34; component of Ford&#39;s name arrives from the <a href="/wiki/Time_Lord" id="w">Time Lords</a>, a fictional alien race from the planet <a href="/wiki/Gallifrey" id="w">Gallifrey</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who" id="w">Doctor Who</a></i>. Its appearance as a <a href="/wiki/Police_car" id="w">police car</a> is interesting considering that the TARDIS looks like a <a href="/wiki/Police_box" id="w">police box</a>.</p>
<p>The &#34;Doctorin&#39; the Tardis&#34; <a href="/wiki/Music_video" id="w">music video</a> features Ford Timelord driving around the countryside in pursuit of some rather crudely designed Daleks, his wailing siren audible throughout. The video was filmed in part at the now defunct <a href="/wiki/RAF_Yatesbury" id="w">RAF Yatesbury</a>, a Royal Air Force base in <a href="/wiki/Wiltshire" id="w">Wiltshire</a>, and - according to The Timelords - cost in the region of Â£8,000 to make.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Reaction" name="Reaction"></a><h2>Reaction</h2>
<p>While the music-buying public of the UK embraced the single, taking it to the number 1 spot within three weeks of its release, the <a href="/wiki/Music_journalism" id="w">music press</a> were strongly negative. <i><a href="/wiki/Melody_Maker" id="w">Melody Maker</a></i> described it as &#34;pure, unadulterated agony ... excruciating&#34;;<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Sounds_(magazine)" id="w">Sounds</a></i> reasoned that it was &#34;a record so noxious that a top ten place can be its only destiny&#34;, calling it a &#34;rancid reworking of ancient discs&#34;.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  The record also reached the Top 10 in <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Norway" id="w">Norway</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup><i><a href="/wiki/Select_(magazine)" id="w">Select</a></i> magazine later reported that &#34;Doctorin&#39; the Tardis&#34; sold over a million copies.<sup id="_ref-select92_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-select92" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a restrospective look at novelty records and a defence of the genre, Peter Paphides wrote in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Observer" id="w">The Observer&#39;s</a></i> music monthly that &#34;the one novelty record most people admit to liking is &#39;Doctorin&#39; The Tardis&#39; by The Timelords... The reason for this, presumably, is that it&#39;s nice to be in on the same joke as arch pop ironist Bill Drummond. Fine, but let&#39;s not forget that if The KLF weren&#39;t passionate about how brilliantly dumb pop can be they wouldn&#39;t have got to Number One.&#34; The &#34;reason we purport to hate novelty records&#34;, he argued, &#34;is because we continue to romanticise the creative process. We feel that our intelligence is insulted by novelty.&#34;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>A 1994 piece in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" id="w">The Guardian</a></i> called &#34;Doctorin&#39;&#34; a &#34;piss-take&#34;. &#34;It was a triumph for Trash Art and it spent exactly one week at the top of the chart. Perfect.&#34;<sup id="_ref-trash_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trash" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>The Timelords released one other product on the strength of &#34;Doctorin&#39; the Tardis&#34;, a 1989 book called <i><a href="/wiki/The_Manual" id="w">The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)</a></i>, in which they candidly described the logistical processes and efforts that sealed the record&#39;s commercial success.</p>
<p>After The Timelords, Drummond and Cauty became The KLF. An American reissue of the single in the mid-1990s lists the artist as The Timelords/The KLF, and features both a KLF track (the original uncut version of &#34;<a href="/wiki/What_Time_Is_Love%3F" id="w">What Time Is Love?</a>&#34;) and &#34;Gary Joins The JAMS&#34;, a version of &#34;Doctorin&#39; the Tardis&#34; with new vocals by Gary Glitter referencing his own songs.</p>
<p>Later attempts of Drummond and Cauty to top the charts were less successful: The KLF&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/Kylie_Said_to_Jason" id="w">Kylie Said to Jason</a>&#34; failed to achieve the chart success for which it was designed,<sup id="_ref-info8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-info8" title="">[12]</a></sup> peaking outside the Top 100, and Cauty&#39;s novelty project <a href="/wiki/I_Wanna_1-2-1_With_You" id="w">Solid Gold Chartbusters</a> with <a href="/wiki/Guy_Pratt" id="w">Guy Pratt</a>, which was designed to be a <a href="/wiki/Christmas_number_one_single" id="w">Christmas number one single</a>, did not reach the UK Top 10. However, The KLF&#39;s string of &#34;Stadium House&#34; singles, beginning with &#34;<a href="/wiki/What_Time_Is_Love%3F" id="w">What Time Is Love?</a>&#34;, found popular appeal and worldwide chart success while dispensing with the opportunistic sheen of &#34;Doctorin&#39; the Tardis&#34;.</p>
<p>In 2005, &#34;Doctorin&#39; the Tardis&#34; was mixed with <a href="/wiki/Green_Day" id="w">Green Day</a>&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/Holiday_(Green_Day_song)" id="w">Holiday</a>&#34;, to create a track called &#34;Dr. Who on Holiday&#34;. The song was part of the Green Day mash-up project <i><a href="/wiki/American_Edit" id="w">American Edit</a></i>.</p>
