<b><i>The Four Stages of Cruelty</i></b> is a series of four printed <a href="/wiki/Engraving" id="w">engravings</a> published by <a href="/wiki/William_Hogarth" id="w">William Hogarth</a> in 1751. Each print depicts a different stage in the life of the fictional Tom Nero. Beginning with the <a href="/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals" id="w">torture of a dog</a> as a child in the <i>First stage of cruelty</i>, Nero progresses to beating his horse as a man in the <i>Second stage of cruelty</i>, and then to <a href="/wiki/Robbery" id="w">robbery</a>, <a href="/wiki/Seduction" id="w">seduction</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Murder" id="w">murder</a> in <i>Cruelty in perfection</i>. Finally, in <i>The reward of cruelty</i>, he receives what Hogarth warns is the inevitable fate of those who start down the path Nero has followed: his body is taken from the <a href="/wiki/Gallows" id="w">gallows</a> after his <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment" id="w">execution</a> as a murderer and is mutilated by <a href="/wiki/Surgery" id="w">surgeons</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Anatomical_theatre" id="w">anatomical theatre</a>.</p>
<p>The prints were intended as a form of <a href="/wiki/Morality" id="w">moral</a> instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the <a href="/wiki/Working_class" id="w">lower classes</a>. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the humorous touches common in Hogarth&#39;s other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>In common with other prints by Hogarth, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Beer_Street" id="w">Beer Street</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Gin_Lane" id="w">Gin Lane</a></i>, <i>The Four Stages of Cruelty</i> was issued as a warning against immoral behaviour, showing the easy path from childish thug to convicted criminal. His aim was to correct &#34;that barbarous treatment of animals, the very sight of which renders the streets of our metropolis so distressing to every feeling mind&#34;.<sup id="_ref-H1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Hogarth loved animals, picturing himself with his <a href="/wiki/Pug" id="w">pug</a> in a self-portrait, and marking the graves of his dogs and birds at his home in <a href="/wiki/Chiswick" id="w">Chiswick</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hogarth deliberately portrayed the subjects of the engravings with little subtlety since he meant the prints to be understood by &#34;men of the lowest rank&#34;<sup id="_ref-H1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H1" title="">[1]</a></sup> when seen on the walls of workshops or <a href="/wiki/Tavern" id="w">taverns</a>.<sup id="_ref-hs_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hs" title="">[3]</a></sup> The images themselves, as with <i>Beer Street</i> and <i>Gin Lane</i>, were roughly drawn, lacking the finer lines of some of his other works. Fine engraving and delicate artwork would have rendered the prints too expensive for the intended audience, and Hogarth also believed a bold stroke could portray the passions of the subjects just as well as fine lines, noting that &#34;neither great correctness of drawing or fine engraving were at all necessary&#34;.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>To ensure that the prints were priced within reach of the intended audience, Hogarth originally commissioned the block-cutter J. Bell to produce the four designs as <a href="/wiki/Woodcut" id="w">woodcuts</a>. This proved more expensive than expected, so only the last two of the four images were cut and were not issued commercially at the time.<sup id="_ref-hs_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hs" title="">[3]</a></sup> Instead, Hogarth proceeded to create the engravings himself and announced the publication of the prints, along with that of <i>Beer Street</i> and <i>Gin Lane</i>, in the <i><a href="/wiki/London_Evening_Post" id="w">London Evening Post</a></i> over three days from <a href="/wiki/14_February" id="w">14 February</a> – <a href="/wiki/16_February" id="w">16 February</a>, <a href="/wiki/1751" id="w">1751</a>.<sup id="_ref-Paul1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Paul1" title="">[5]</a></sup> The prints themselves were published on <a href="/wiki/21_February" id="w">21 February</a> 1751<sup id="_ref-gordon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gordon" title="">[6]</a></sup> and each was accompanied by a moralising commentary, written by the Rev. <a href="/wiki/James_Townley" id="w">James Townley</a>, a friend of Hogarth&#39;s.<sup id="_ref-gordon_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gordon" title="">[6]</a></sup> As with earlier engravings, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Industry_and_Idleness" id="w">Industry and Idleness</a></i>, individual prints were sold on &#34;ordinary&#34; paper for <i>1s.</i> (one <a href="/wiki/Shilling" id="w">shilling</a>), cheap enough to be purchased by the lower classes as a means of moral instruction. &#34;Fine&#34; versions were also available on &#34;superior&#34; paper for <i>1s. 6d.</i> (one shilling and <a href="/wiki/Sixpence" id="w">sixpence</a>), for collectors.<sup id="_ref-H1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Variations on plates III and IV exist from Bell&#39;s original woodcuts, bearing the earlier date of <a href="/wiki/1_January" id="w">1 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1750" id="w">1750</a>,<sup id="_ref-H1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and were reprinted in 1790 by <a href="/wiki/John_Boydell" id="w">John Boydell</a>, but examples from either of the woodcut printings are uncommon.<sup id="_ref-hs_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hs" title="">[3]</a></sup>{{Ref_label}}</p>

In the first print Hogarth introduces Tom Nero, whose name may have been inspired by the <a href="/wiki/Nero" id="w">Roman Emperor of the same name</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Contraction_(grammar)" id="w">contraction</a> of &#34;No hero&#34;.<sup id="_ref-GU_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GU" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-BMJ_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BMJ" title="">[8]</a></sup> Conspicuous in the centre of the plate, he is shown being assisted by other boys to insert an arrow into a <a href="/wiki/Dog" id="w">dog</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Rectum" id="w">rectum</a>, a torture apparently inspired by a devil punishing a sinner in <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Callot" id="w">Jacques Callot</a>&#39;s <i>Temptation of St. Anthony</i>.<sup id="_ref-Paul1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Paul1" title="">[5]</a></sup> An initialled badge on the shoulder of his light-hued and ragged coat shows him to be a pupil of the <a href="/wiki/Charity_school" id="w">charity school</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Parish" id="w">parish</a> of <a href="/wiki/St_Giles%26%2339%3B_Circus" id="w">St Giles</a>. Hogarth used this notorious <a href="/wiki/Slum" id="w">slum</a> area as the background for many of his works including <i>Gin Lane</i> and <i>Noon</i>, part of the <i><a href="/wiki/Four_Times_of_the_Day" id="w">Four Times of the Day</a></i> series. A more tender-hearted boy, perhaps the dog&#39;s owner,<sup id="_ref-SS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SS" title="">[9]</a></sup> pleads with Nero to stop tormenting the frightened animal, even offering food in an attempt to appease him.

The other boys carry out equally barbaric acts: the two boys at the top of the steps are burning the eyes out of a bird with a hot needle heated by the <a href="/wiki/Link-boy" id="w">link-boy</a>&#39;s torch; the boys in the foreground are <a href="/wiki/Cock_throwing" id="w">throwing at a cock</a> (perhaps an allusion to a nationalistic enmity towards the <a href="/wiki/Early_Modern_France" id="w">French</a>, and a suggestion that the action takes place on <a href="/wiki/Shrove_Tuesday" id="w">Shrove Tuesday</a>, the traditional day for cock-shying);<sup id="_ref-H2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H2" title="">[10]</a></sup> another boy ties a bone to a dog&#39;s tail—tempting, but out of reach; a pair of fighting <a href="/wiki/Cat" id="w">cats</a> are hung by their tails and taunted by a jeering group of boys; in the bottom left-hand corner a dog is set on a cat; and in the rear of the picture another cat tied to two <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Bladder">bladders</a> is thrown from a high window. In a foreshadowing of his ultimate fate, Tom Nero&#39;s name is written under the chalk drawing of a man hanging from the gallows; the meaning is made clear by the schoolboy artist pointing towards Tom. The absence of parish officers who should be controlling the boys is an intentional rebuke on Hogarth&#39;s part; he agreed with <a href="/wiki/Henry_Fielding" id="w">Henry Fielding</a> that one of the causes for the rising crime rate was the lack of care from the overseers of the poor, who were too often interested in the posts only for the social status and monetary rewards they could bring.<sup id="_ref-Paul1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Paul1" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Below the text the authorship is established: <i>Designed by W. Hogarth, Published according to Act of Parliament.

Many of Hogarth&#39;s earlier works had been reproduced in great numbers without his authority or any payment of <a href="/wiki/Royalties" id="w">royalties</a>, and he was keen to protect his artistic property, so had encouraged his friends in <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Parliament</a> to pass a law to protect the rights of engravers. Hogarth had been so instrumental in pushing the Bill through Parliament that on passing it became known as the &#34;Hogarth Act&#34;.<sup id="_ref-gordon2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gordon2" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

In the second plate, the scene is <a href="/wiki/Thavies_Inn_Gate" id="w">Thavies Inn Gate</a> (sometimes ironically written as Thieves Inn Gate), one of the <a href="/wiki/Inns_of_Chancery" id="w">Inns of Chancery</a> which housed associations of lawyers in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Tom Nero has grown up and become a <a href="/wiki/Hackney_carriage" id="w">hackney</a> <a href="/wiki/Coachman" id="w">coachman</a>, and the recreational cruelty of the schoolboy has turned into the professional cruelty of a man at work.  Tom&#39;s horse, worn out from years of mistreatment and overloading, has collapsed, breaking its leg and upsetting the carriage. Disregarding the animal&#39;s pain, Tom has beaten it so furiously that he has put its eye out. In a satirical aside, Hogarth shows four corpulent <a href="/wiki/Barrister" id="w">barristers</a> struggling to climb out of the carriage in a ludicrous state. They are probably <a href="/wiki/Caricature" id="w">caricatures</a> of eminent jurists, but Hogarth did not reveal the subjects&#39; names, and they have not been identified. Elsewhere in the scene, other acts of cruelty against animals take place: a <a href="/wiki/Drover_(Britain)" id="w">drover</a> beats a <a href="/wiki/Domestic_sheep" id="w">lamb</a> to death, an <a href="/wiki/Donkey" id="w">ass</a> is driven on by force despite being overloaded, and an <a href="/wiki/Bull-baiting" id="w">enraged bull</a> tosses one of its tormentors. Some of these acts are recounted in the moral accompanying the print:

<p>The cruelty has also advanced to include abuse of people. A <a href="/wiki/Dray" id="w">dray</a> crushes a playing boy while the <a href="/wiki/Drayman" id="w">drayman</a> sleeps, oblivious to the boy&#39;s injury and the beer spilling from his barrels. Posters in the background advertise a <a href="/wiki/Cockfight" id="w">cockfight</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Boxing" id="w">boxing</a> match as further evidence of the brutal entertainments favoured by the subjects of the image. The boxing match is to take place at Broughton&#39;s Amphitheatre, a notoriously tough venue established by the &#34;father of pugilism&#34;, <a href="/wiki/Jack_Broughton" id="w">Jack Broughton</a>: a contemporary bill records that the contestants would fight with their left leg strapped to the floor, with the one with the fewest bleeding wounds being adjudged the victor.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> One of the advertised participants in the boxing match is <a href="/wiki/James_Field" id="w">James Field</a>, who was hanged two weeks before the prints were issued and features again in the final image of the series; the other participant is <a href="/wiki/George_Taylor_(boxer)" id="w">George &#34;the Barber&#34; Taylor</a>, who had been champion of England but was defeated by Broughton and retired in 1750.

By the time of the third plate, Tom Nero has progressed from the mistreatment of animals to theft and murder. Having encouraged his pregnant lover, Ann Gill, to rob and leave her mistress, he murders the girl when she meets him. The murder is shown to be particularly brutal: her neck, wrist, and <a href="/wiki/Index_finger" id="w">index finger</a> are almost severed. Her trinket box{{Ref_label}} and the goods she had stolen lie on the ground beside her, and the index finger of her partially severed hand points to the words &#34;God&#39;s Revenge against Murder&#34; written on a book that, along with the <i><a href="/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer" id="w">Book of Common Prayer</a></i>, has fallen from the box.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> A woman searching Nero&#39;s pockets uncovers pistols, a number of <a href="/wiki/Pocket_watch" id="w">pocket watches</a>—evidence of him having turned to highway robbery (as Tom Idle did in <i><a href="/wiki/Industry_and_Idleness" id="w">Industry and Idleness</a></i> ), <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> and a letter from Ann Gill which reads:</p>

<p>Various features in the print are meant to intensify the feelings of dread: the murder takes place in a graveyard, said to be <a href="/wiki/St_Pancras%2C_London" id="w">St Pancras</a> but suggested by <a href="/wiki/John_Ireland_(biographer)" id="w">John Ireland</a> to resemble <a href="/wiki/Marylebone" id="w">Marylebone</a>;<sup id="_ref-H2_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H2" title="">[10]</a></sup> an <a href="/wiki/Owl" id="w">owl</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Bat" id="w">bat</a> fly around the scene; the moon shines down on the crime; the clock strikes one for the end of the <a href="/wiki/Witching_hour" id="w">witching hour</a>.

Having been tried and found guilty of murder, Nero has now been <a href="/wiki/Hanging" id="w">hanged</a> and his body taken for the ignominious process of <a href="/wiki/Public_dissection" id="w">public dissection</a>. The year after the prints were issued, the <a href="/wiki/Murder_Act_1752" id="w">Murder Act 1752</a> would ensure that the bodies of murderers could be delivered to the surgeons so they could be &#34;dissected and anatomised&#34;. It was hoped this further punishment on the body and denial of burial would act as a deterrent.<sup id="_ref-OB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OB" title="">[20]</a></sup> At the time Hogarth made the engravings, this right was not enshrined in law, but the surgeons still removed bodies when they could.<sup id="_ref-Paul1_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Paul1" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Tattoo" id="w">tattoo</a> on his arm identifies Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown to have as much feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse&#39;s was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one of its kind in the first plate.<sup id="_ref-Paul1_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Paul1" title="">[5]</a></sup> Nero&#39;s face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience.

<p>While the surgeons working on the body are observed by the <a href="/wiki/Square_academic_cap" id="w">mortar-boarded</a> academics in the front row, the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves.<sup id="_ref-FH_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FH" title="">[21]</a></sup> The president has been identified as <a href="/wiki/John_Freke" id="w">John Freke</a>, president of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England" id="w">Royal College of Surgeons</a> at the time.<sup id="_ref-H2_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H2" title="">[10]</a></sup>{{Ref_label}} Freke had been involved in the high-profile attempt to secure the body of condemned rioter <a href="/wiki/Bosavern_Penlez" id="w">Bosavern Penlez</a> for dissection in 1749.<sup id="_ref-Paul1_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Paul1" title="">[5]</a></sup>

Both men were hanged shortly before the print was published. The skeletons seemingly point to one another.

<p>Hogarth was pleased with the results. <i>European Magazine</i> reported that he commented to a bookseller from <a href="/wiki/Cornhill" id="w">Cornhill</a> (a Mr. Sewell):<sup id="_ref-Paul1_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Paul1" title="">[5]</a></sup>

In his 1817 book <i>Shakespeare and His Times</i>, <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Drake" id="w">Nathan Drake</a> credits the representation of &#34;throwing at cocks&#34; in the first plate for changing public opinion about the practice, which was common at the time, and prompting magistrates to take a harder line on offenders.
Others found the series less to their liking. <a href="/wiki/Charles_Lamb" id="w">Charles Lamb</a> dismissed the series as mere caricature, not worthy to be included alongside Hogarth&#39;s other work, but rather something produced as the result of a &#34;wayward humour&#34; outside of his normal habits.<sup id="_ref-CL_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CL" title="">[23]</a></sup> Art historian <a href="/wiki/Allan_Cunningham_(author)" id="w">Allan Cunningham</a> also had strong feelings about the series:<sup id="_ref-Cunningham_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cunningham" title="">[24]</a></sup>

The <a href="/wiki/Anatomy_Act_1832" id="w">Anatomy Act 1832</a> ended the dissection of murderers, and most of the animal tortures depicted were outlawed by the <a href="/wiki/Cruelty_to_Animals_Act_1835" id="w">Cruelty to Animals Act 1835</a>, so by the 1850s <i>The Four Stages of Cruelty</i> had come to be viewed as a somewhat historical series, though still one with the power to shock,<sup id="_ref-cassell_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cassell" title="">[25]</a></sup> a power it retains for a modern audience.<sup id="_ref-finlay_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-finlay" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

<p><b>a.</b> {{Note_label}}A pair of impressions from Bell&#39;s original printing were acquired for <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" id="w">£1600</a> by the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Glasgow" id="w">University of Glasgow</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Hunterian_Museum_and_Art_Gallery" id="w">Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery</a> in 2005.<sup id="_ref-NMS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NMS" title="">[26]</a></sup>

<b>b.</b> {{Note_label}}There is some confusion over the date of George &#34;The Barber&#34; Taylor&#39;s career and death. In his earlier work Paulson puts him as a pupil of Broughton, killed in a fight with him in 1750, and the Tate Gallery dates Hogarth&#39;s sketches to c.1750.<sup id="_ref-Tate_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tate" title="">[27]</a></sup> In <i>Hogarth&#39;s &#34;Harlot&#34;</i>, he states that Taylor retired in 1750 but came out of retirement in 1757 for a final fight in which he was badly beaten, dying from his injuries several months later. Most records date Taylor&#39;s championship to the middle 1730s.

<b>c.</b> {{Note_label}}The initials on the box are normally read as A. G. for Ann Gill, but the G resembles a D, suggesting the box too may have been stolen.

<b>d.</b> {{Note_label}}John Ireland identifies the president as &#34;Mr Frieake, the master of <a href="/wiki/Edward_Nourse" id="w">Nourse</a>, to whom <a href="/wiki/Percival_Pott" id="w">Mr Potts</a> was a pupil&#34;. Since Ireland identifies him as the master of Nourse, he undoubtedly means John Freke, an acquaintance of Hogarth&#39;s and surgeon at <a href="/wiki/St_Bartholomew%26%2339%3Bs_Hospital" id="w">St Bartholomew&#39;s Hospital</a> from 1729–1755 and a Governor 1736–1756. The dissection could be taking place at St Bartholomew&#39;s Hospital, where all three surgeons were based, but it also has features of the Cutlerian Theatre of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_College_of_Physicians" id="w">Royal College of Physicians</a> near <a href="/wiki/Newgate" id="w">Newgate</a> (particularly the throne, which bears their arms, and its curved wall resembling a <a href="/wiki/Cockpit_(gambling)" id="w">cockpit</a>) and the niches of the <a href="/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Barbers" id="w">Barber-Surgeons&#39; Hall</a> (which was not used for dissection after the Surgeons split away to form the <a href="/wiki/Company_of_Surgeons" id="w">Company of Surgeons</a> in 1745).
