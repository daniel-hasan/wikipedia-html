The Manitoba Legislature

History and construction

In 1911, the Manitoba government announced an architectural competition to all architects in the British Empire, with a grand prize of $10,000 was offered for the best design for the new Manitoba Legislative Building;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. The third building used by Manitoba's legislative assembly;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. The first, the home of A.G.B. Bannatyne, the second stood on the same grounds as the current Legislative building;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. Of the 67 submissions, Frank Worthington Simon, a former student at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, had his design chosen for the construction of the impressive structure;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;;&quot;[http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000057 Frank Lewis Worthington Simon]&quot;, at Dictionary of Scottish Architects.;. 

Construction began in 1913, with Tyndall stone, quarried at Garson, about 20 kilometers northeast of Winnipeg;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. On June 3, 1914 the north-east cornerstone ceremony, which was commonly done by masons, was laid by Thomas Kelly, the contractor.Due to World War I in 1914 causing a shortage of material, labor and funds, the construction of the massive building was slowed and was not ready for partial occupancy until 1919;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. On July 15, 1920, the province's 50th anniversary date, opening ceremonies were performed by Sir James Aikins, then Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;.

The base of the building forms the letter ''H'';&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. The total square footage of the building is 250,000 square feet, with a total height of 242 feet above ground level toped with a 21.5-karat gold statue of the Greek God Hermes or the Romans God Mercury;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. The Legislative grounds cover 30 acres of landscaped grounds;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. Throughout the exterior and interior of the building are examples of Fibonacci Sequence, Golden Ratio and Sacred Geometry.

Exterior

The Golden Boy, &quot;Eternal Youth&quot;, or Mercury

Coming up to the north side of the Legislative Building, above the 6 main columns, is the main pediment;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. In the bottom-left corner of the pediment is the Indolent Man, with a half-kneeling woman, the spirit of progress, beckoning the Indolent Man into the new land of promise;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. Next is the goddess Europa leading a bull, symbolizing Canada's European heritage and immigration;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;.To the right of Europa, a man, woman and child symbolizing the colonization of a new land;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. Seated in the center is Lady Manitoba with the rays of the sun behind her;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;.She closely resembles the fertility goddesses Ishtar and Demeter, both patron deities of agriculture, with Neptune's trident symbolizing the Pacific Ocean, and to the left and to the right are ships wheels symbolizing the Atlantic Ocean. Next to the right of Lady Manitoba are a man and a woman laden with wheat and fruit, products of the soil;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;.Then next is a muscular male figure with a team of powerful horses and a primitive plow tilling the soil;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. Finally in the bottom right corner are two entwined female figures representing the Red and Assiniboine Rivers;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;.

Above the main pediment, flanking both sides are two Egyptian sphinxes facing both east and west;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. Carved onto a flat piece of stone, just below the chin, in Egyptian hieroglyphics, is &quot;The everlasting manifestation of the Sun God Ra, the good God who gives life.&quot;

Each one of the four corners of the copper dome supporting the Golden Boy has a stonework grouping representing the four elements of alchemy, earth, air, fire and water. They are identified as Agriculture, Science, Industry and Art;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. The dome is 223 feet 7 inches above the main floor. The height of the central tower without the Golden Boy is 242 feet. The Golden Boy was sculpted by Georges Gardet and cast in bronze at the Barbidienne foundry in France in 1918.;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/golden.html Golden Boy]&quot;, at the''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.; Modeled after the 16th century sculpture of Mercury by Giovanni da Bologna. The true name of the Golden Boy is &quot;Eternal Youth&quot;. Originally painted gold, &quot;Eternal Youth&quot; was gilded in 1951 in 23.5-karat gold leaf. He stands 17.2 feet tall from toe to torch; and weighs 1,650 kg (3,640 pounds).; He carries a sheaf of golden grain in his left arm,; while his right hand holds high a torch.; The gold is a symbol of alchemy and those who searched for ways to turn lead into gold.

On both the east and west porticos sit figures representing war and peace. On the east side, with engraved images of weapons of war, are two male figures, one a native warrior with an eagle head-dress, another a Roman soldier, and on the west side there are two female figures for peace. Each pair guards a chest, rumored to represent the Ark of the Covenant because of the proper proportions as mentioned in the ancient Hebrew texts.

The figure was sculpted by Charles Gardet of Paris, and cast in 1918 at the Barbidienne foundry in France. The foundry was partially destroyed by bombs during the First World War, but the Golden Boy emerged unharmed. The figure was rushed to a seaport and put aboard a French ship carrying wheat. Before the ship could put out to sea, it was commandeered for the transport of troops.

 The boy lay in the hold of the ship, travelling many miles, constantly in danger. When the war was over, the figure arrived at Halifax and was shipped to Winnipeg and finally hoisted to the top of Manitoba's then-new Legislative Building.

Grand Staircase

The Grand Staircase, North side
The Grand Staircase, South side

Within the main entrance is the Grand Staircase.This is a perfectly square room measuring 66.6 feet on each side, which is meant to represent the numerological number 666, which are all the numbers added from one to 36, which is the square of 6, in mathematics, geometry, and arithmetic. The stair case is composed of three flights of steps each with 13 steps.;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/grand.html The Interior]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.; The steps are brown-veined Carrara marble,; the finest marble in the world.Flanking the steps are life size North American bison.; Made of solid bronze,; they were modeled by Charles Gardet, creator of the Golden Boy,; and cast at the Roman Bronze Works in New York City.; Each bison weighs 2,268 kilograms (2½ tons).; Legend has it that to install the bison safely without damaging the marble floors, the main entrance was flooded and left to freeze. Both bison were then placed on enormous slabs of ice cut from the Assiniboine River, and safely slid into the building.; The bison are one example of apotropaic icons in the Grand Staircase. 

The bison, a symbol of the Province of Manitoba, are meant to represent the sacred bulls which guard temple entrances. Above the south entrance to the legislature lobby is the Medusa's head, and over the north entrance facing Medusa is the bust of Athena, Greek goddess of war, embodiment of democracy and also the protector of cities.Around the perimeter of the room are 14 lion heads and 8 cattle skulls at the edge of the ceiling.Around the second floor balcony, lamps rise from the balustrades,; each containing 13 bulbs, 12 around 1 (Twelve Apostles and Jesus). The third floor facing the Grand Staircase is supported by two pairs of columns, reproductions of the caryatids,; sculpted female figures serving as an architectural support taking the place of a column or a pillar. Each figure holds a scroll and key. The figures located on the third floor were sculpted by the Piccirilli Brothers of New York,; using models prepared by Albert Hodge of London, England. The ceiling is made of a glass atrium to allow natural sunlight to illuminate the room.;

Rotunda

Rotunda, North side
Rotunda, South side

The antechamber at the head of the grand staircase provides a formal approach to the legislative chamber;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The Rotunda]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. 8 Corinthian columns rise from the floor to the cornice surrounding the base of the dome;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The Rotunda]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. Between each pair of columns are busts of Hermes. The floor of the dome rotunda is Tennessee marble bordered with black Vermont and verde antique marble;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The Rotunda]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. The height to the eye of the dome is 87 feet and the diameter is 54 feet. Within the dome above are four panels containing 5 gold rosettes. In the center of the Rotunda is an Italian marble balustrade 13 feet across surrounding the Pool of the Black Star on the floor of the level below, a representation of the altars of the ancient Greeks.The diameter of the circle above the balustrade is also 13 feet, and both align with the Golden Boy above these.Above the doorway to the Manitoba Assembly is a mural by Frank Brangwyn depicting World War I;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The Rotunda]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. In the center of the painting is a man in tattered rags with his left chest and arm exposed, being helped along by a comrade. Above the men are a faint depiction of The Madonna and child.

Pool of the Black Star

Pool of the Black Star

The Pool of the Black Star is the room below the Rotunda with four entrances and marked by 3 steps forming a circumference of the room. The room is a perfect circle with a radius of 27 feet, and the number 27 is the cube of 3 in geometry.Carved in marble on the floor is an 8 pointed star. Directly above in alignment with the Pool of the Black Star is the dome of the building on which the Golden Boy is mounted. The alignment of the two markers is one degree off the longitudinal center of Canada. The Black Star is said to represent the underworld of Ishtar and the Golden Boy, Hermes, is the messenger of the Heavens. The design of the building allows sounds and harmonics from all over the building to be caught, distorted, and magnified in the circular room at the star. The design of the Pool is so perfect that when you stand at the centre of the star and speak you can hear your own echo returning to you from all directions equally and if you whistle up to the golden boy a perfect harmonic 5th is created (the sound of Hermes).

Lieutenant-Governor's Reception Room

In the east corridor of the Manitoba Legislative Building is the Lieutenant-Governor's Reception Room. This finely decorated room is used by the Lieutenant-Governor on state occasions to receive visiting royalty and foreign dignitaries and general public is barred from entry. During such events, scarlet-coated Royal Canadian Mounted Police are posted on either side of the door and military aides assist the Lieutenant-Governor with official duties. The room is paneled in black American walnut inlaid with ebony, and decorated with hand-carved ornaments around the ceiling and along the four corner pillars.Pictures of sovereigns grace the walls and a French gilt chandelier hangs from the ceiling. The floor features a carpet specially handwoven in Donegal, Ireland. Facing across from each other on the north and south wall are two elaborate mirrors in gilt frames. The room measures 24 feet in both directions. Directly above the Lieutenant-Governor's Reception Room are the two male warriors (War), one native in full eagle feathered head dress, and one Roman, guarding the representation of the Ark of the Covenant.

Legislative Chamber

The Legislative Chamber

The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and the Lieutenant Governor form the Legislature of Manitoba, the legislative branch of government in the Canadian Province of Manitoba. Fifty-seven members are elected to this assembly in provincial general elections, all in single-member constituencies with first-past-the-post voting;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. Originally, in 1870, there were 24 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs);&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;.As the province grew in population and size, more electoral divisions were added;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;.Winnipeg was once the third largest city in Canada, and often named Chicago of the North;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;.

Manitoba's Legislative chamber is unique among Provincial Legislatures in that the Members' benches are grouped in a horseshoe shape;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. The Speaker's Chair of the House is located on the south wall below the press gallery of 13 seats;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;.All debate is addressed to the Speaker, who rules on points of order and procedure and has the responsibility of maintaining order and decorum.

When the Legislature is in session, each day begins in accordance with procedures that have origins in the early beginnings of Parliamentary rule;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. The speaker enters the Legislative Chamber followed by the clerks of the Legislative Assembly and preceded by the Sergeant-at-arms bearing the Manitoba's Mace;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;.

The original desks and chairs of the Chamber are fashioned of walnut with inlaid ebony;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. They are arranged in three tiers rising from a sunken floor in the center of the Chamber;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. Each desk is equipped with a microphone connected to a public address system and a recording machine used in the publication of Hansard, a verbatim report of debates and proceedings in the Legislature;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. During question period, translators provide simultaneous translation from French to English;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. The Chamber is also equipped for video and internet broadcasts of question period and special events such as throne and budget speeches;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. Yet even as such changes have brought the assembly into the future, the original inkwells employed by an earlier generation of Manitoban politicians are still visible;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;. To the right of the speaker is a statue of Moses holding the Ten Commandments, to the left is Solon, a famous lawmaker of ancient Athens. Each statue is made of bronze and sculpted by Gardet.

Today

The Manitoba Legislative Building is by far the most expensive building in Manitoba, and it is irreplaceable.The cost of construction today would be impossible, especially considering the lack of very skilled mason workers that would be capable enough;&quot;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]&quot;, at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.;.

A very popular book was published in 2007 entitled ''The Hermetic Code'', by Frank Albo;;, which uncovers a lot of the Masonic and classical history incorporated into the building.
