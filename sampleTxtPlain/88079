Film and television career
The 6 ft 4 inch (193 cm) Frakes moved to New York City and became a member of &quot;The Impossible Ragtime Theater.&quot; In that company, Frakes did his first off-Broadway acting inEugene O'Neill's ''The Hairy Ape''. His first Broadway appearance was in ''Shenandoah''. At the same time, he landed a role in the NBC soap opera ''The Doctors''. When his character was dismissed from the soap, Frakes moved to Los Angeles, California and played guest spots in many of the top television shows of the 1970s and 1980s, including ''The Waltons'', ''The Dukes of Hazzard'',''Matlock'', and Steven Bochco's ''Hill Street Blues''. He played the part of Charles Lindbergh in a 1983 episode of ''Voyagers!'' titled &quot;An Arrow Pointing East&quot;.In 1983, he had a role in the short-lived NBC prime time soap opera ''Bare Essence'' (which also starred his future wife Genie Francis).

He has done animation voice acting, most notably voicing the recurring role of David Xanatos in the animated series ''Gargoyles'', and he provided the voice of his own head in a jar in the ''Futurama'' episode &quot;Where No Fan Has Gone Before.&quot; He hosted ''Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction'' and had a small, uncredited role in the 1994 movie ''Camp Nowhere''. He also reprised his role of Riker for a ''Next Generation'' cutaway on an episode of ''Family Guy'' that also featured his co-stars Patrick Stewart and Michael Dorn as their respective roles of Jean-Luc Picard|Picard and Worf.

Frakes is one of only two ''Star Trek'' regulars to appear on four different ''Star Trek'' series (''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'', ''Star Trek: Voyager'' and ''Star Trek: Enterprise'').(The only other regular to match or exceed that number is Majel Barrett-Roddenberry who appeared in all six television series.)He has also directed episodes in three of them (''TNG'', ''DS9'' and ''VOY'') and was a popular and innovative director on the Star Trek set, often finding completely new ways to shoot the show's familiar sets.His directing career has included the films ''Star Trek: First Contact'' and ''Star Trek: Insurrection''.Additionally, Frakes was an executive producer for the WB show ''Roswell'', directed several episodes and guest-starred in three episodes.His relationship with Star Trek is made light of in the episode &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot;, in which the alien character Max ironically auditions for a guest role as an alien for ''Star Trek: Enterprise''.

Outside of acting, Frakes appeared on the Phish album ''Hoist'', playing trombone on the track titled &quot;Riker's Mailbox.&quot; Frakes would occasionally perform on the trombone during his tenure as Commander Riker.
