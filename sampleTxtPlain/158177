;Condoleezza Rice (born November 14 1954) is the 66th United States Secretary of State, and the second in the administration of President George W. Bush to hold the office. Rice is the first black woman, second black person (after Colin Powell, who served before her from 2001 to 2005), and second woman (after Madeleine Albright who served from 1997 to 2001) to serve as Secretary of State. Rice was President Bush's National Security Advisor during his first term, but before joining the Bush administration, she was a Professor of political science at Stanford University where she served as Provost from 1993 to 1999. During the administration of George H.W. Bush, Rice also served as the Soviet and East European Affairs Advisor during the dissolution of the Soviet Union and German reunification.

When beginning as Secretary of State, Rice pioneered a policy of Transformational Diplomacy, with a focus on democracy in the greater Middle East. Her emphasis on supporting democratically elected governments faced challenges as Hamas captured a popular majority in Palestine yet supported Islamist terror, and influential countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt maintained non-democratic systems with U.S. support. Her policies and strong diplomatic style gained her recognition as a powerful leader by mainstream media. She chairs the Millennium Challenge Corporation's board of directors.;http://www.millennium.az:8101/mcaccount.htm;

In addition to English, she speaks, with varying degrees of fluency, Russian, German, French, and Spanish.;Sullivan, Andrew.[http://www.andrewsullivan.com/people.php Bush-Rice 2004? The rise and rise of Condi], The Sunday Times, March 24, 2002.;

She was instructed to walk proudly in public and to use the facilities at home rather than subject herself to the indignity of &quot;colored&quot; facilities in town.

She was a specialist on the former Soviet Union and gave lectures on the subject for the Berkeley-Stanford joint program led by UC Berkeley Professor George Breslauer in the mid-1980s.

Provost promotion
Former Stanford President Gerhard Casper said the university was &quot;most fortunate in persuading someone of Professor Rice's exceptional talents and proven ability in critical situations to take on this task. Everything she has done, she has done well; I have every confidence that she will continue that record as provost.&quot;;http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/93/930519Arc3267.html; Rice’s Stanford appointment was considered, by Casper, an effort to address concerns about alleged bias at Stanford University.

Balancing school budget

Rice's Transformational Diplomacy involves five core elements:
* Relocating American diplomats to the places in the world where they are needed most, such as China, India, Brazil, Egypt, Nigeria, Indonesia, South Africa, and Lebanon.
* Requiring diplomats to serve some time in hardship locations such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, and Angola; gain expertise in at least two regions; and become fluent in two foreign languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, or Urdu.
* Focusing on regional solutions to problems like terrorism, drug trafficking, and diseases.
* Working with other countries on a bilateral basis to help them build a stronger infrastructure, and decreasing foreign nations' dependence on American hand-outs and assistance.
* Creating a high-level position, Director of Foreign Assistance, to oversee U.S. foreign aid, thus de-fragmenting U.S. foreign assistance.

Rice also pressed for finding transnational solutions as well, stating that &quot;in the 21st century, geographic regions are growing ever more integrated economically, politically and culturally. This creates new opportunities but it also presents new challenges, especially from transnational threats like terrorism and weapons proliferation and drug smuggling and trafficking in persons and disease.&quot;;
Rice unveils her plan for restructuring American foreign policy, which she calls &quot;Transformational Diplomacy,&quot; during a January 18, 2006 speech at Georgetown University
Another aspect of the emphasis on regional solutions is the implementation of small, agile, &quot;rapid-response&quot; teams to tackle problems like disease, instead of the traditional approach of calling on experts in an embassy. Rice explained that this means moving diplomats out of the &quot;back rooms of foreign ministries&quot; and putting more effort into &quot;localizing&quot; the State Department's diplomatic posture in foreign nations. The Secretary emphasized the need for diplomats to move into the largely unreached &quot;bustling new population centers&quot; and to spread out &quot;more widely across countries&quot; in order to become more familiar with local issues and people.;

Rice restructured U.S. foreign assistance, naming Randall L. Tobias, an AIDS relief expert, as administrator of USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development).

Rice says these initiatives are necessary because of the highly &quot;extraordinary time&quot; in which Americans live. She compares the moves to the historic initiatives taken after World War II, which she claims helped stabilize Europe as it is known today.

Rice negotiated differences between Israel and Palestine that included a proposed blacklist of Palestinians that had been detained by Israel and a concern that future violence would induce a renewed closure of the border crossings. By November 15, Rice announced an agreement to open Gaza's borders, with a system of transportation between Gaza and the West Bank, defining operations for transporting cargo and people across the border and allowing Gaza to reopen its international airport and begin work on a seaport. This included the Rafah border crossing, Palestine's only land link to a country other than Israel. It also included monitoring of the crossings by officials from the European Union.;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/15/AR2005111500144_2.html &quot;Rice Negotiates Deal to Open Gaza Crossings&quot;], ''The Washington Post'', November 16, 2005.;

Gideon Levy, reporter for an Israeli newspaper, complained Rice had accomplished little: &quot;in what was considered the &quot;achievement&quot; of the current visit, Israel also promised to open the Karni crossing.

Hamas, Palestinian elections
Map showing electoral districts and areas of formal Palestinian control (green)
Rice pushed for peaceful, democratic elections in Palestine following the death of Yasser Arafat. Rice asserted that &quot;there should be the ability of Palestinian people to participate in the elections&quot; and claimed that democratic elections would represent &quot;a key step in the process of building a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state.&quot; Rice, alluding to the U.S.-labeled terrorist organization Hamas, stated that &quot;there should be no place in the political process for groups or individuals who refuse to renounce terror and violence, recognize Israel's right to exist, and disarm,&quot; saying, &quot;You cannot have one foot in politics and the other foot in terror.&quot;;[http://www.voanews.com/uspolicy/archive/2006-01/2006-01-18-voa2.cfm &quot;Rice on Palestinian Elections&quot;], ''Voice of America'', January 18, 2006, News.;

Rice persuaded a reluctant Israel to allow Israeli Palestinians in East Jerusalem to vote in the Palestinian Authority elections. Israel allowed Palestinians in East Jerusalem to vote in the January 25, 2006 parliamentary elections, while banning Hamas, which officially calls for Israel's destruction, from campaigning there. Rice lauded the turnout and congratulated President Abbas, while informing the victorious Hamas that it would &quot;have to make some difficult choices,&quot; saying, &quot;Those who win elections have an obligation to govern democratically. … It now inherits the obligations of a Palestinian government, authority, that go back now for more than a decade to recognize the right of Israel to exist, to renounce violence, to disarm militias, as is the case in the roadmap, and to find a peaceful solution in two states.&quot;;[http://usinfo.state.gov/is/Archive/2006/Jan/31-340686.html &quot;Rice Lauds Peaceful Palestinian Elections, Decries Terrorism&quot;], ''usinfo.state.gov'', January 30, 2006.;

In response to the Hamas victory, Israel withheld funds belonging to the Palestinian Authority, and reinforced restrictions on movement in and out of the Gaza Strip and within the West Bank. Rice stated: “Clearly, [Hamas] cannot govern in a circumstance in which they cannot represent a responsible government before the international system.” Rice told her Israeli counterpart that “the economic boycott on the Hamas-led Palestinian government is effective and in the international community will continue to maintain the boycott.”;Geoffrey Aronson, [http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=3460 &quot;A Bush policy of 'Après moi, le deluge’&quot;], ''Daily Star Egypt'', October 16, 2006, retrieved March 15, 2007.;

Immediately following Hamas' victory in the elections, Rice attempted to garner international support in demanding that Hamas recognize Israel's right to exist.

2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict
Rice delivers a special briefing on Middle East Peace in the State Department Briefing Room, July 21, 2006
In mid-July 2006, the Middle East peace process encountered a new obstacle on a different front when Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon launched rocket attacks into Israel and ambushed Israeli convoys, kidnapping two soldiers and killing three, sparking what has become known as the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. Rice immediately condemned the act, calling Hezbollah a &quot;terrorist organization&quot; and saying that the action &quot;undermines regional stability and goes against the interests of both the Israeli and Lebanese people,&quot; specifically calling on Syria to &quot;use its influence to support a positive outcome.&quot;;[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/68902.htm &quot;Actions in Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon&quot;], ''United States Department of State'', online posting, ''state.gov'', July 12, 2006.; That day, Rice was one of the first to speak directly to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni concerning the incident. Israel initiated aerial bombardments against Lebanon on July 13 and sent in land troops on July 23 to take out rocket launching sites that were shelling Northern Israeli cities, as well as to look for and recover the two kidnapped Israeli soldiers.

During the conflict, Rice supported Israel's right to defend itself from Hezbollah attacks, she repeatedly cautioned Israel to be responsible in minimizing collateral damage. Before the major fighting began, Rice demanded that both Israel and Lebanon &quot;act with restraint to resolve this incident peacefully and to protect innocent life and civilian infrastructure.&quot; She also continued to pressure Syria to take a more active positive role throughout the crisis, accusing Syria of &quot;sheltering the people who have been perpetrating these acts&quot; and calling on it &quot;to act responsibly and stop the use of its territory for these kinds of activities[,] to bring all pressure on those that it is harbouring to stop this and to return these soldiers and to allow the situation to be de-escalated.&quot;;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L13880934.htm &quot;U.S.'s Rice Urges Israel to Exercise Restraint&quot;], online posting, ''alertnet.org'', July 13, 2006, The News (newsdesk).;

Rice, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi work to lay the foundation for Resolution 1701, which ultimately imposed a ceasefire on the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict
When Rice arrived in the Middle East in July 2006, one of her first moves was an unannounced visit to Lebanese Prime Minister Siniora to praise Siniora's &quot;courage and steadfastness&quot; and show U.S. support for the Lebanese people.;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/5209778.stm Rice holds key talks in Lebanon]. July 24, 2006.; Rice stated that the conflict was part of &quot;the birth pangs of a new Middle East,&quot; stating that Israel, Lebanon, and the international community had to &quot;be certain that we're pushing forward to the new Middle East not going back to the old one.&quot;;[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/69331.htm &quot;Special Briefing on Travel to the Middle East and Europe&quot;], United States Department of State, online posting, ''state.gov'', July 21, 2006.;

At a time when progress appeared possible in the region, the Israeli military launched an airstrike on a suspected Hezbollah hideout in Qana, Lebanon, that killed 20–60 civilians. The airstrike seemed to sour support for Israel's endeavor and Lebanon cancelled a visit by Rice as a result.;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L30778296.htm Israel strike kills at least 54, Lebanon shuns Rice]. July 30, 2006.; While the tragedy was a setback in the negotiation process, it seemed to be a turning point for Israel, who, afterward, began taking a path toward a cease-fire. Before Rice left the region on July 27, she was able to negotiate a 48-hour halt on Israeli air-raids.

Rice appears with former UN Secretary General Annan to announce the successful passage of Resolution 1701, which imposed a ceasefire on the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict
Rice returned to the Mideast on July 29, where the outlines of the ceasefire to come began to take shape. Rice demanded that the global community do what it could to ensure that the Mideast region would never again return to the &quot;status quo ante.&quot; Rice saw the situation as an opportunity to create a new environment in which Israel and Lebanon could live in peace, and in which Lebanon could have full control over all its territories without Hezbollah acting as a &quot;state within a state,&quot; being able to launch terrorist attacks on Israel. Building on the two resolutions that came out of the G8 Conference and the steps that had been taken at the conference in Rome, Italy in late July, Rice worked with other leaders at the United Nations to pass UN Security Council Resolution 1701 on August 11, 2006, which sought to resolve the crisis. The ceasefire went into effect on August 14. The ceasefire that Rice helped broker provided for a full cessation of hostilities, a Lebanese-led international force to take the place of the Israeli forces, the disarmament of Hezbollah, full control of the Lebanese government to Lebanon, and an absence of paramilitary forces (including and implying Hezbollah) south of the Litani River; it also emphasizes the need for the immediate release of the two kidnapped Israeli soldiers. Rice lauded the outcome and expressed pleasure that the hostilities in the area had been brought to an end. Though there were sporadic, but small, spurts of violence after the ceasefire took effect, it has ultimately sustained, while international peacekeeping forces began to replace Israeli forces. On October 2, 2006, the last Israeli forces were withdrawn, allowing the UN and the Lebanese military to take over.;[http://www.metro.co.uk/home/article.html?in_article_id=20428&amp;in_page_id=1 &quot;Israel Leaves Lebanon to UN&quot;], online posting, ''metro.co.uk'', July 24, 2006.;

In recent years, Iran has also begun to pursue nuclear technology through uranium enrichment, which has been one of the most pertinent issues that Rice has dealt with during her tenure at the State Department. Iran maintains that its nuclear program only seeks to develop the capacity for peaceful civilian nuclear power generation.;; Rice, along with other nations, has contended that Iran's record of sponsoring terrorism and threatening the safety of other nations, along with its defiance of its treaty obligations, of the United Nations Security Council, and of the International Atomic Energy Agency, have not proven Iran to be responsible enough to conduct uranium enrichment without outside supervision. Under Rice, the official State Department consensus on the matter is that &quot;[t]he United States believes the Iranian people should enjoy the benefits of a truly peaceful program to use nuclear reactors to generate electric power ...

Rice has focused international attention on North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Beginning in 2003, a series of talks featuring China, North Korea, South Korea, the United States, Russia, and Japan, dubbed &quot;The Six Party talks,&quot; have been aimed at denuclearization.

On February 10 2005, North Korea withdrew from the talks after President George W.

She identified six such &quot;outposts&quot; in which she said the United States has a duty to foster freedom: Cuba, Zimbabwe, Burma and Belarus, as well as Iran and North Korea.

Abortion
Rice said &quot;If you go back to 2000 when I helped the president in the campaign. I said that I was, in effect, kind of libertarian on this issue. And meaning by that, that I have been concerned about a government role in this issue. I am a strong proponent of parental choice -of parental notification. I am a strong proponent of a ban on late-term abortion. These are all things that I think unite people and I think that that's where we should be. I've called myself at times mildly pro-choice.&quot;;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30282-2005Mar12.html Washington Post, March 2005]; She would not want the federal government &quot;forcing its views on one side or the other.&quot;;[http://www.4condi.com/issuequotation.htm Washington Times, March 2005];

Rice said she believes President Bush &quot;has been in exactly the right place&quot; on abortion, &quot;which is we have to respect the culture of life and we have to try and bring people to have respect for it and make this as rare a circumstance as possible&quot; However, she added that she has been &quot;concerned about a government role&quot; but has &quot;tended to agree with those who do not favor federal funding for abortion, because I believe that those who hold a strong moral view on the other side should not be forced to fund&quot; the procedure.;[http://www.4condi.com/issuequotation.htm Washington Times, March 2005];

Public perception and criticisms
Rice makes an appearance at Boston College, where she is greeted by Father William P. Leahy|William Leahy
Rice has been criticised for her involvement in the George W. Bush administration both in the United States and abroad. Protesters have sought to exclude her from appearing at schools such as Princeton University;Michael Juel-Larsen. [http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2005/09/30/news/13275.shtml Students, community members protest Rice's visit]. Daily Princetonian, September 30, 2005.; and Boston College,;Steve Almond.

There has also been an effort to protest her public speeches abroad.;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2006/03/30/news_condvisit_messageboard_feature.shtml Rice visit meets with protests] BBC News, March 31, 2006.

=''Time'' and ''Forbes'' magazines=
Rice has appeared on Time magazine's list of the world's 100 most influential people four times. Rice is one of only three people in the entire world considered influential enough to have made the list so frequently. However Time magazine has also accused her of squandering her influence, stating in February 1, 2007, that her &quot;accomplishments as Secretary of State have been modest, and even those have begun to fade&quot; and that she &quot;has been slow to recognize the extent to which the U.S.'s prestige has declined.&quot;;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1584810,00.html &quot;Rice's Toughest Mission&quot;], ''Time'', February 1, 2007.; However, in its March 19, 2007 issue it followed up stating that Rice was &quot;executing an unmistakable course correction in U.S. foreign policy.&quot;;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1597516-2,00.html &quot;Cheney In Twilight&quot;], ''Time'', March 19, 2007.;

In 2004 and 2005, she was ranked as the most powerful woman in the world by ''Forbes'' magazine and number two in 2006 (following the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel).;MacDonald, Elizabeth and Chana R. Schoenberger.[http://www.forbes.com/2006/08/31/most-powerful-women_cz_em_06women_0831intro.html &quot;The World's Most Powerful Women&quot;], ''Forbes'', September 1, 2006.;

=Criticisms from Senator Boxer=
California Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer has also criticized Rice in relation to the war in Iraq: &quot;I personally believe — this is my personal view — that your loyalty to the mission you were given, to sell the war, overwhelmed your respect for the truth.&quot;;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27818-2005Jan21.html Why the Crass Remarks About Rice?]. The Washington Post, January 22, 2005.;

On January 11, 2007, Boxer, in a debate over the war in Iraq, said, &quot;Now, the issue is who pays the price, who pays the price? I’m not going to pay a personal price. My kids are too old, and my grandchild is too young. You’re not going to pay a particular price, as I understand it, within immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families, and I just want to bring us back to that fact.”

The ''New York Post'' and White House Press Secretary Tony Snow considered this an attack on Rice's status as a single, childless female and referred to Boxer's comments as &quot;a great leap backward for feminism.&quot;;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,243359,00.html &quot;White House Spokesman Blasts Sen. Boxer's Exchange With Secretary Rice&quot;], FOX News, January 12, 2006.; Rice later echoed Snow's remarks, saying &quot;I thought it was okay to not have children, and I thought you could still make good decisions on behalf of the country if you were single and didn’t have children.&quot; Boxer responded to the controversy by saying &quot;They’re getting this off on a non-existent thing that I didn’t say. I’m saying, she’s like me, we do not have families who are in the military.&quot;;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/washington/12cnd-rice.html?ex=1176350400&amp;en=b000ac5ebcd6d164&amp;ei=5070 &quot;Exchange Turns Into Political Flashpoint&quot;], ''The New York Times'', January 12, 2007;

=Views within the black community=
Rice's approval ratings from January 2005 to September 2006
Rice and Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer participate in a news conference at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, May 23, 2007

Rice's ratings saw decreases following a heated battle for her confirmation as Secretary of State and following Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Rice's rise within the George W. Bush administration initially drew a largely positive response from many in the black community. In a 2002 survey, then National Security Advisor Rice was viewed favorably by 41% of black respondents, but another 40% did not know Rice well enough to rate her and her profile remained comparatively obscure.;Jonathon Tilove. [http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/tilove031104.html For Black America, The Thrill of Powell and Rice Is Gone]. Newhouse News Service, March 11, 2004.; As her role increased, some black commentators began to express doubts concerning Rice's stances and statements on various issues. In 2005, ''Washington Post'' columnist Eugene Robinson asked, &quot;How did [Rice] come to a worldview so radically different from that of most black Americans?&quot;;Eugene Robinson. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/24/AR2005102401370.html What Rice Can't See]. The Washington Post, October 25, 2005.;

Other writers have also noted what they perceive to be a distance between Rice and the black community. ''The Black Commentator'' magazine described sentiments given in a speech by Rice at a black gathering as &quot;more than strange — they were evidence of profound personal disorientation. A black woman who doesn’t know how to talk to black people is of limited political use to an administration that has few black allies.&quot;;[http://www.blackcommentator.com/84/84_cover_condi.html Condoleezza's Crimes]. The Black Commentator, April 1, 2004.; When Rice invoked the civil rights movement to clarify her position on the invasion of Iraq, Margaret Kimberley, another writer for ''The Black Commentator'', felt that her use of the rhetoric was &quot;offensive.&quot; Stan Correy, an interviewer from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, characterized many blacks involved with civil rights and politics as viewing this rhetoric as &quot;cynical.&quot;;Stan Correy. [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s1338813.htm Condoleezza, Condoleezza]. ABC Radio National, April 3, 2005.; Rice was also described by Bill Fletcher, Jr., the former leader of the TransAfrica Forum, a foreign policy lobbying organization in Washington, D.C., as &quot;very cold and distant and only black by accident.&quot;; In August 2005, American musician, actor, and social activist Harry Belafonte, who serves on the Board of TransAfrica, referred to blacks in the Bush administration as &quot;black tyrants.&quot;;Marc Merano. [http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewSpecialReports.asp?Page=%5CSpecialReports%5Carchive%5C200508%5CSPE20050808a.html Harry Belafonte Calls Black Republicans 'Tyrants']. Cybercast News Service, August 8, 2005; Belafonte's comments received mixed reactions.;

Rice has defended herself from such criticisms on several occasions. During a September 14, 2005 interview, she said: &quot;Why would I worry about something like that? ... The fact of the matter is I've been black all my life. Nobody needs to tell me how to be black.&quot;;[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/53155.htm Interview With Bill O'Reilly of the O'Reilly Factor on Fox News]. September 14, 2005.;
