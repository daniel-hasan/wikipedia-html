Dachau was a Nazi German concentration camp, and the first one opened in Germany, located on the grounds of an abandoned munitions factory near the medieval town of Dachau, about 16 km (10 miles) northwest of Munich in southern Germany.

Opened on 22 March 1933, the Dachau concentration camp was the first regular concentration camp established by the coalition government of National Socialist (Nazi) NSDAP party and the catholic Zentrum party (dissolved at 6 July 1933). Heinrich Himmler, in his capacity as police president of Munich, officially described the camp as &quot;the first concentration camp for political prisoners.&quot;;http://www.mazal.org/archive/DACHPHO/Dach02.htm Translation: The Munich Chief of Police, Himmler, has issued the following press announcement: On Wednesday the first concentration camp is to be opened in Dachau with an accommodation for 5000 persons. ''All Communists and—where necessary—Reichsbanner and Social Democratic functionaries who endanger state security are to be concentrated here, as in the long run it is not possible to keep individual functionaries in the state prisons without overburdening these prisons, and on the other hand these people cannot be released because attempts have shown that they persist in their efforts to agitate and organise as soon as they are released.'';

Dachau served as a prototype and model for the other Nazi concentration camps that followed. Its basic organization, camp layout as well as the plan for the buildings were developed by Kommandant Theodor Eicke and were applied to all later camps. He had a separate secure camp near the command center, which consisted of living quarters, administration, and army camps. Eicke himself became the chief inspector for all concentration camps, responsible for molding the others according to his model.;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. &quot;The Holocaust.&quot; Holocaust Encyclopedia. http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005214;

In total, over 200,000 prisoners from more than 30 countries were housed in Dachau of which nearly one-third were Jews.; ;25,613 prisoners are believed to have died in the camp and almost another 10,000 in its subcamps,;That Was Dachau 1933 - 1945 by Stanislav Zámečník Page 377 and 379; primarily from disease, malnutrition and suicide. In early 1945, there was a typhus epidemic in the camp followed by an evacuation, in which large numbers of the weaker prisoners died.

Together with the much larger Auschwitz, Dachau has come to symbolize the Nazi concentration camps to many people. Konzentrationslager (KZ) Dachau holds a significant place in public memory because it was the second camp to be liberated by British or American forces. Therefore, it was one of the first places in which the West was exposed to the reality of Nazi brutality through firsthand journalist accounts and through newsreels.;Among the most famous inmates of the Dachau concentration camp were [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Litten Hans Litten], Fred Rabinowitz (a.k.a. Fred Roberts), Stefan Starzynski, the composer Blaž Arnič and Alfred Gruenebaum, the father of a prominent U.S. obstetrician, Amos Grunebaum.;

Prisoners' barracks in 1945

The camp was divided into two sections: the camp area and the crematorium. The camp area consisted of 32 barracks, including one for clergy imprisoned for opposing the Nazi regime and one reserved for medical experiments. The courtyard between the prison and the central kitchen was used for the summary execution of prisoners. An electrified barbed-wire gate, a ditch, and a wall with seven guard towers surrounded the camp.;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. &quot;The Holocaust.&quot; Holocaust Encyclopedia. http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005214;

In early 1937, the SS, using prisoner labor, initiated construction of a large complex of buildings on the grounds of the original camp. Prisoners were forced to do this work, starting with the destruction of the old munitions factory, under terrible conditions. The construction was officially completed in mid-August 1938 and the camp remained essentially unchanged and in operation until 1945. Dachau thus was the longest running concentration camp of the Third Reich. The area in Dachau included other SS facilities beside the concentration camp—a leader school of the economic and civil service, the medical school of the SS, etc. The KZ at that time was called a &quot;protective custody camp,&quot; and occupied less than half of the area of the entire complex.

Dachau also served as the central camp for Christian religious prisoners. According to records of the Roman Catholic Church, at least 3,000 religious, deacons, priests, and bishops were imprisoned there.;Particularly notable among the Christian residents are Karl Leisner (Catholic priest ordained while in the camp, beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1996) and Martin Niemöller (Protestant theologian and Nazi resistance leader).;

In August 1944 a women's camp opened inside Dachau. Its first shipment of women came from Auschwitz Birkenau. Only nineteen women guards served at Dachau, most of them until liberation.;''THE CAMP WOMEN, The Female Auxiliaries who Assisted the SS in Running the Nazi Concentration Camp System'' by Daniel Patrick Brown.; ;Sources show the names of sixteen of the nineteen women guarding the camp; Fanny Baur, Leopoldine Bittermann, Ernestine Brenner, Anna Buck, Rosa Dolaschko, Maria Eder, Rosa Grassmann, Betty Hanneschaleger, Ruth Elfriede Hildner, Josefa Keller, Berta Kimplinger, Lieselotte Klaudat, Theresia Kopp, Rosalie Leimboeck, and Thea Miesl. Women guards were also staffed at the Augsburg Michelwerke, Burgau, Kaufering, Muhldorf, and Munich Agfa Camera Werke subcamps. In mid-April 1945 many female subcamps at Kaufering, Augsburg and Munich closed, and the SS women stationed at Dachau. It is reported that female SS guards gave prisoners guns before liberation to save them from postwar prosecution.;

In the last months of the war, the conditions at Dachau became even worse. As Allied forces advanced toward Germany, the Germans began to move prisoners in concentration camps near the front to more centrally located camps. They hoped to prevent the liberation of large numbers of prisoners. Transports from the evacuated camps arrived continuously at Dachau. After days of travel with little or no food or water, the prisoners arrived weak and exhausted, often near death. Typhus epidemics became a serious problem as a result of overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, insufficient provisions, and the weakened state of the prisoners.

Owing to continual new transportations from the front, the camp was constantly overcrowded and the hygiene conditions were beneath human dignity. Starting from the end of 1944 up to the day of liberation, 15,000 people died, about half of all victims in KZ Dachau. Five hundred Soviet POWs were executed by firing squad.

On 27 April 1945 Victor Maurer, delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross, was allowed to enter camps and distribute food. In the evening of the same day a prisoner transport arrived from Buchenwald. Only 800 survivors were brought from the original 4,480 to 4,800 prisoners in transit. Over 2,300 corpses were left lying in and around the train. The last regular commander of the KZ, Obersturmbannführer Eduard Weiter, had fled on 26 April. He probably followed Obersturmbannführer Martin Weiss, who had led the camp from September 1942 until November 1943.

On 28 April 1945, the day before the surrender, Camp Commandant Martin Weiss had left the Dachau camp, along with most of the regular guards and administrators in the camp. On that same day, Victor Maurer, a representative of the Red Cross, had tried to persuade Untersturmführer Johannes Otto, the adjutant of Commandant Weiss, not to abandon the camp, but to leave guards posted to keep the prisoners inside until the Americans arrived. Maurer feared that the prisoners would escape ''en masse'' and spread the active typhus fever epidemic. Lt. Otto declined to remain and fled.

Liberation of the camp
Corpses lie in one of the open railcars of the Dachau death train

On 29 April 1945 the watchtowers of the Dachau camp remained occupied and a white flag was hoisted. Red Cross representative Maurer persuaded SS-Sturmscharführer Heinrich Wicker, an officer in the SS-Totenkopfverbände, to accompany him to the main gate of the complex to surrender the camp formally.

Late in the afternoon of 29 April 1945 KZ Dachau was surrendered to the American Army by SS-Sturmscharführer Heinrich Wicker.; http://www.scrapbookpages.com/Dachauscrapbook/DachauLiberation/Wicker.html; A vivid description of the surrender appears in Brig. Gen. Henning Linden's official &quot;Report on Surrender of Dachau Concentration Camp&quot;:

;As we moved down along the west side of the concentration camp and approached the southwest corner, three people approached down the road under a flag of truce. We met these people about 75 yards north of the southwest entrance to the camp. These three people were a Swiss Red Cross representative and two SS troopers who said they were the camp commander and assistant camp commander and that they had come into the camp on the night of the 28th to take over from the regular camp personnel for the purpose of turning the camp over to the advancing Americans. The Swiss Red Cross representative acted as interpreter and stated that there were about 100 SS guards in the camp who had their arms stacked except for the people in the tower. He said he had given instructions that there would be no shots fired andit would take about 50 men to relieve the guards, as there were 42,000 half-crazed prisoners of war in the camp, many of them typhus infected. He asked if I were an officer of the American army, to which I replied, &quot;Yes, I am Assistant Division Commander of the 42d Division and will accept the surrender of the camp in the name of the Rainbow Division for the American army.&quot; ;

General Dwight D. Eisenhower, issued a communique over the capture of Dachau concentration &quot;Our forces liberated and mopped up the infamous concentration camp at Dachau. Approximately 32,000 prisoners were liberated; 300 SS camp guards were quickly neutralized.&quot;;Staff, quoting Abram Sachar on [http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/camps/dachau/dachau-01.htmlThe Liberation of Dachau], Nizkor Project.;

Tablet dedicated to the 42nd Division. A tablet at the camp commemorates the liberation of Dachau by the 442nd Infantry Division of the U.S. Seventh Army on 29 April 1945. Other claim that the first forces to enter the main camp were a battalion of the 157th Infantry Regiment of the 45th Infantry Division commanded by Felix L. Sparks. There is an on-going disagreement as to which division, the 42nd or the 45th, actually liberated Dachau because they seem to have approached by different routes and by the American Army's definition, anyone arriving at such a camp within forty-eight hours was a liberator.;Albert Panebianco (ed). [http://www.45thinfantrydivision.com/index14.htm Dachau its liberation] 57th Infantry Association, Felix L. Sparks, Secretary 15 June 1989. ([http://www.remember.org/witness/sparks2.html backup site]) Cites a letter by James R. Bird to Joseph I. Lieberman; General Patton visited the Buchenwald camp after it was liberated, but not Dachau. 

The Americans found approximately 32,000 prisoners, crammed 1,600 to each of 20 barracks, which had been designed to house 250 people each. US troops also found almost forty railroad cars, each filled with one hundred or more corpses.; 

The Americantroops that captured the camp were so horrified by conditions at the camp that a few shot some of the camp guards after they had surrendered in what is called the Dachau massacre. The number massacred is disputed as some Germans were killed in combat, some were killed while attempting to surrender, and others were killed after their surrender was accepted. Felix L. Sparks the commander of a battalion that captured the camp has stated that &quot;The total number of German guards killed at Dachau during that day most certainly not exceed fifty, with thirty probably being a more accurate figure. The regimental records [of the 57th Infantry Regiment] for that date indicate that over a thousand German prisoners were brought to the regimental collecting point. Since my task force was leading the regimental attack, almost all the prisoners were taken by the task force, including several hundred from Dachau&quot;.;Albert Panebianco (ed). [http://www.45thinfantrydivision.com/index14.htm Dachau its liberation] 57th Infantry Association, Felix L. Sparks, Secretary 15 June 1989. ([http://www.remember.org/witness/sparks2.html backup site]); The &quot;[American Army] Investigation of Alleged Mistreatment of German Guards at Dachau&quot; found that about fifteen Germans were killed (with another four or five wounded) after their surrender had been accepted.Two other reports collated years after the incident put the figure between 122 and 520 Germans killed after their surrender had been accepted.;Staff. A review of[http://www.scrapbookpages.com/dachauscrapbook/DachauLiberation/BuechnerAccount.html Col. Howard A. Buechner's account of execution of Waffen-SS soldiers during the liberation of Dachau], [http://www.scrapbookpages.com/AboutUs.html Scrapbookpages.com], 28 July, 2006 ;

As a result of the American Army investigation court-martial charges were drawn up against Sparks and several other men under his command, but as George S. Patton|General Patton, the recently appointed military governor of Bavaria chose to dismiss the charges so the witnesses to the massacre were never cross examined in court and no one was found guilty.;

The U.S. troops also forced citizens of the local community to come to the camp, observe the conditions, and help clean the facilities. Many local residents were indignant about the experience and claimed no knowledge of the camp's activities.

Post-liberation Easter at Dachau
Liberated Dachau camp prisoners cheer U.S. troops

A few days after the liberation of the camp was the day of Pascha, Orthodox Easter. In a cell block used by Catholic priests to say daily mass, several Greek, Serbian, and Russian priests and one Serbian deacon, wearing makeshift vestments made from towels of the SS guard, gathered with several hundred Greek, Serbian and Russian prisoners to celebrate the Paschal Matins and Liturgy. A prisoner named Rahr described the scene: 

;''In the entire history of the Orthodox Church there has probably never been an Easter service like the one at Dachau in 1945. Greek and Serbian priests together with a Serbian deacon adorned the make-shift 'vestments' over their blue and gray-striped prisoners' uniforms. Then they began to chant, changing from Greek to Slavonic, and then back again to Greek. The Easter Canon, the Easter Sticheras—everything was recited from memory. The Gospel—'In the beginning was the Word'—also from memory. And finally, the Homily of Saint John—also from memory. A young Greek monk from the Holy Mountain stood up in front of us and recited it with such infectious enthusiasm that we shall never forget him as long as we live. Saint John Chrysostomos himself seemed to speak through him to us and to the rest of the world as well!'';
Crowd of cheering survivors

There is a Russian Orthodox chapel at the camp today, and it is well known for its exquisite icon of Christ leading the prisoners out of the camp gates.

The U.S. 7th Army's version of the events of the Dachau Liberation are available in ''Report of Operations of the Seventh United States Army,'' Vol. 3, page 382.

After liberation
After liberation, the camp was used by the US Army as an internment camp. In 1948 the Bavarian government established housing for refugees on the site, and this remained for many years.;[http://www.gedenkstaettenpaedagogik-bayern.de/ausstellungstexte.htm Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site (pedagogical information)] ;

The memorial site
The commemorative mass grave dedicated to the unknown dead at Dachau &quot;Never again&quot; written in several languages
Between 1945 and 1948 when the camp was handed over to the Bavarian authorities, many accusedwar criminals and members of the SS were imprisoned at the camp.After this period, due to a severe housing shortage and the arrival of many thousands of refugees from Eastern Germany, the camp was used as temporary housing until the 1950s. During this time, former prisoners banded together to erect a memorial on the site of the camp, finding it unbelievable that there were still people (refugees) living in the former camp.

The display, which was reworked in 2003, takes the visitor through the path of new arrivals to the camp. Special presentations of some of the notable prisoners are also provided. Two of the barracks have been rebuilt and one shows a cross-section of the entire history of the camp, since the original barracks had to be torn down due to their poor condition when the memorial was built. The other 28 barracks are indicated by concrete foundations.

The memorial includes four chapels for the various religions represented among the prisoners.

The local government resisted designating the complete site a memorial. The former SS barracks adjacent to the camp are now occupied by the Bavarian Bereitschaftspolizei (rapid response police unit).;;
