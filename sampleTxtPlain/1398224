The Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (; often abbreviated as HKCEC or 會展) is one of the two major convention and exhibition venues in Hong Kong, along with AsiaWorld-Expo. It is located in Wan Chai North, Hong Kong Island. Built along the Victoria Harbour, it is linked by covered walkways to nearby hotels and commercial buildings. 

Construction

The original building was built on reclaimed land off Gloucester Road in 1988. The glass curtain was the world's largest at the time, overlooking the Victoria Harbour on three sides. 

The second phase of the centre, located on an artificial island, was constructed from 1994 to 1997, and features a bird-like rooftop (also referred to as a turtle by some critics). It is connected to the old phase with an atrium link - a sky bridge, and to Convention Road with two road bridges. The project took only 48 months from reclamation to completion, which is extremely fast for a building project of this size. The main constructor of the extension was a joint venture named Hip Hing Construction Co Ltd Dragages et Travaux Publics.
The atrium link will be rebuilt and expanded.[http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/infrastructureandlogistics/051021/html/051021en06005.htm]

The complex's construction was financed by New World Development, with the [http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/HKGHV Renaissance Harbour View Hotel], Grand Hyatt Hong Kong and Harbour View Apartments on top of it.

The HKCEC has a total internal exhibition area of more than 28,000 square metres with 16-metre headroom and spans ranging from 26 m to 81 m. Its multi-curved steel roof has a total area of 40,000 m², while the 7,000 m² fully glazed main entrance foyer has a clear headroom of about 60 metres.

Management

The Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (Management) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of NWS Holdings Ltd (新創建集團有公司), is contracted by the HKTDC for the day-to-day management and operation of the HKCEC. The Managing Director of the company is Cliff Wallace.

There have been comments that the management of HKCEC provided preferential treatment to some client with regards to booking dates at the HKCEC. Cliff Wallace rebutted this allegations in a meeting with the Legislative Councilors in the 2003-2004 session. He reiterated during the meeting that his company did not provide preferential treatment, that dates were offered on a first-come-first-served basis and standard industry practices were exercised with regards to booking and scheduling at the HKCEC as required by the operating agreement with HKTDC.[http://www.legco.gov.hk/lcsearch/showdoc.htm?mylink=/search/marker?s=9&amp;o=2&amp;t=2&amp;a=15&amp;r=2&amp;k=1,&amp;g=0&amp;PROPERTY=2;&amp;MERGEFIELD=-&amp;CODECONVERT=-&amp;SORTFIELDS=-&amp;SIM_START=1&amp;SIM_NUM=10&amp;REL_START=1&amp;REL_NUM=10&amp;LINK=-&amp;REDIRECTTO=-&amp;PATHLINK=-&amp;p=Convention%20and%20Exhibition%20Centre&amp;c=16,1&amp;i=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.legco.gov.hk%2Fyr03-04%2Fenglish%2Fpanels%2Fci%2Fpapers%2Fci0423cb1-1602-7e.pdf&amp;j=3553&amp;v=&amp;n=&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.legco.gov.hk%2Fyr03-04%2Fenglish%2Fpanels%2Fci%2Fpapers%2Fci0423cb1-1602-7e.pdf]

With its strategic location near the city's financial heart and its comprehensive facilities, the HKCEC has become one of Hong Kong's competitive assets. It raises city's profile by providing a world-class venue for hosting major international trade fairs and conferences.

In recent years, the HKCEC has attracted an increasing number of local, mainland and overseas companies to market their products, services and ideas to the world on its premises. Buyers and sellers meet here and a large number of business transactions are made during these fairs, such as the Hong Kong International Film and TV market and the Hong Kong Food expo.They regard organising events at the HKCEC as a convenient and cost-effective way to source or sell in the region.
