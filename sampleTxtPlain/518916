The Royal Rumble is an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view event, produced every January by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).;; The event's main featured match is a Battle Royal-type match,;; entitled the Royal Rumble match. The pay-per-view is part of WWE's &quot;Big Four&quot;, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series.;Ian Hamilton. ''Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition'' (p.160); The Royal Rumble is also one of WWE's more popular pay-per-views.;;

The Rumble was originally aired on the USA Network before it was rebranded as a pay-per-view.;; The rules and format of the Rumble match have changed since the match's debut.; Now, the winner of the Rumble match receives a title match at that year's WrestleMania.;

Pay-per-view
The Royal Rumble is a pay-per-view consisting of the Royal Rumble match, championship matches, and various other matches. The first Royal Rumble took place on January 24 1988 and was broadcast live on the USA Network.; The following year, the event was rebranded as a pay-per-view.;; It is part of WWE's &quot;classic five&quot; pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Survivor Series, SummerSlam, and King of the Ring.;

The Royal Rumble match is usually situated at the top of the List of professional wrestling slang#C|card.;; This, however, is not always the case, as the 2006 event had the match in the middle of the pay-per-view.;

The first Rumble match featured only twenty men,; and it was called the Rumble Royale.; It lasted approximately thirty-three minutes of the two-hour broadcast.;; The modern Rumble matches are much longer, with the longest match, at the 2002 event, lasting over one hour and nine minutes of an approximately three-hour pay-per-view.;

The 2008 Royal Rumble will be the first WWE pay-per-view to be available in high-definition and will cost $10 more than a standard-definition pay-per-view.;;;;

Match
Stone Cold Steve Austin has won three Royal Rumble matches, which is also the current record for most wins.;
=Rules=
The idea behind the Royal Rumble match is credited to Pat Patterson.;; Before the match begins, the contestants draw spots in the Rumble.; The match is comprised of 30 men, beginning with the two men who chose entry numbers one and two in the ring.; At regular timed intervals, usually two minutes, one of the remaining 28 wrestlers enters the ring.; Participants must eliminate all other opponents, and the winner of the event is the last wrestler remaining after all others have been eliminated.;;

Similar to a Battle Royal, a wrestler is eliminated when leaving the ring over the top rope, with both feet touching the floor.;;;; A referee, who is situated at ringside, must witness an elimination in order for it to be valid.;; It is commonplace for a wrestler who is eliminated without the referee noticing to sneak back into the match. For example, Stone Cold Steve Austin was eliminated during the 1997 event, but he re-entered without the referees' knowledge and eventually won the match.; Moreover, a wrestler who exits the ring without going over the top rope is not eliminated from the contest. During the 1999 Rumble match, both Vince McMahon and Steve Austin left the ring, only to return later in the match.;;

=Rewards for winning=
The reward for the 1992 Royal Rumble was the WWF Championship.; The tradition of granting a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania started in 1993.;; Beginning in 2004, the winner had their choice of a World Heavyweight Championship or WWE Championship match at WrestleMania.; Due to the revival of the ECW World Championship as a brand championship in mid-2006, the 2007 event added this championship as a choice to the winning stipulation.;; The Rumble winner has gone on to win a Championship title at WrestleMania every year since WrestleMania X-Seven in 2001.;

=Brand extension=
With the brand extension introduced in mid-2002, the 30 entrants from 2003 to 2006 consisted of 15 wrestlers from both the RAW and WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown! brands. At first, the winner of the match received a shot at his brand's champion.;; Starting in 2004, the Rumble winner had the option of challenging either brand's champion.; For instance, Chris Benoit switched brands in 2004 and won the World Heavyweight Championship.; The 2007 Royal Rumble marked the first year participants from the ECW brand competed along with the RAW and SmackDown! brands.;; The winner of the Royal Rumble now has the option to challenge for the ECW World Championship, as well.;
