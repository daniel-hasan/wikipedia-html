 is an action-adventure game developed and published by Konami. It is part of Konami's best-selling ''Castlevania'' video game series and the first ''Castlevania'' game to be released on the Nintendo DS. It is the sequel to Konami's ''Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow'' and incorporates many elements from its predecessor. The game was commercially successful, selling more than 15,000 units in its first week in Japan and 164,000 units in the United States three months after its initial release.;;;;

The game takes place in the fictional universe of the ''Castlevania'' series, where the vampire hunters of the List of Castlevania characters#The Belmont clan|Belmont clan wage an endless conflict against the immortal vampire Dracula. ''Dawn of Sorrow'' continues the storyline found in ''Aria of Sorrow'', in which Dracula has been completely defeated, and his powers assumed by his reincarnation, Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Soma Cruz|Soma Cruz. With the help of his allies, Soma avoids becoming the new dark lord. A cult forms to bring forth a new dark lord by killing Soma. Soma and his allies move to ensure that a new dark lord is not created.

''Dawn of Sorrow'' incorporates many features from previous ''Castlevania'' games: the combination of elements from platform games and console role-playing games, the &quot;Tactical Soul&quot; system featured in ''Aria of Sorrow'', and a dark, gothic atmosphere.;;;; ''Dawn of Sorrow'' also introduces new gameplay elements, such as the &quot;Magic Seal&quot; system, which requires the use of the Nintendo DS#Input and output|DS stylus to draw a pattern in order to defeat powerful enemies,; a distinctive anime character design,;; and a multiplayer mode, where two players compete for fastest times on a prerendered level.; The game received high scores from many video game publications, and was considered one of the best games on the Nintendo DS for 2005. The game was re-released in Japan on June 29, 2006 in the &quot;Konami the Best&quot; line.;;

Gameplay
An image of gameplay, with the primary character, Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Soma Cruz|Soma Cruz, using the Flame Demon soul. The upper screen shows the character's statistics and information on the enemy.
During the game, the player controls the onscreen character from a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series and most role-playing games, characters experience point#Level-based progression|level up each time they earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies; each &quot;level&quot; gained increases the character's Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics, thus improving their performance in battle.;; Statistics include, but are not limited to, hit points, the amount of damage a character can receive; magic points, which determine the amount of times a character can use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells.;; Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon choices are largely medieval, including but not limited to swords, axes, and spears, although handguns and a rocket propelled grenade are available.; These weapons differ in their damage output, the range of the weapon, and the speed of the attack.;;

''Dawn of Sorrow'', similar to most games in the ''Castlevania'' series, is set in a castle, which is further subdivided into various areas.;Areas of the castle differ in their composition, including monsters and terrain features. In addition, each area has its own unique piece of theme music that plays while the player remains in that area.; The character moves around the environment based on the player's choices; however, the areas the character can move into are restricted based upon the items the player has, similar to most platform games.; Progression, however, is not linear, as the player is free to explore the parts of the castle they have access to, and can backtrack or move forward as they see fit.;

=Tactical Soul=
The primary method for the player to gain additional abilities in the game is the absorption of souls via the Tactical Soul system, which was originally featured in ''Aria of Sorrow''.; Except for human enemies and the game's final opponent, all enemies' souls can be absorbed by the player. The chances for absorbing a soul varies on the enemy, as certain enemies will release souls more regularly than others.;; The player can absorb multiple copies of the same soul; many of these souls will increase in effectiveness depending on the number of the same soul a player possesses.; These souls provide a variety of effects, and are separated into four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant, and Ability souls. The player can only have one type of Bullet, Guardian, and Enchant soul equipped at any given time. However, when the player acquires the &quot;Doppleg√§nger&quot; soul, the player can have two different weapon and soul setups, and switch between them at will.; Players can trade souls wirelessly using two ''Dawn of Sorrow'' game cards.;

Bullet souls are often projectiles, and consume a set amount of magic points upon use.;; Guardian souls provide continuous effects, including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning of familiars.; The movement and attacking of familiars can be directly controlled with the Nintendo DS#Input and output|stylus.; Guardian souls continually drain magic points so long as they are activated.; Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are passive, and require no magic points to remain active.;; Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore not equipped, nor do they consume magic points.; Some examples include the ability to break ice blocks with the stylus, and the ability to double-jump.;

Souls can alternatively be used to permanently transform a character's weapon.; At Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Yoko Belnades|Yoko Belnades' shop, the player can remove certain souls from their inventory in order to change their weapon into a stronger form.; Certain weapons can only be acquired through using souls to strengthen a lesser form of the weapon.; Souls are also used in the &quot;Enemy Set&quot; mode, where a player builds a custom scenario.;; The player can place monsters inside rooms if the player has acquired the monster's soul in the main game, but boss enemies cannot be added to any scenario, even if the player has the boss' soul.; Two players, using two Nintendo DS consoles, can compete in these scenarios, with the winner being the one with the fastest time in completing the course.;

A Magic Seal presented after defeating a boss. In this case, the player would use the Nintendo DS#Input and output|DS stylus to draw a &quot;V&quot; connecting the dots in order to defeat the boss.

=Magic Seal=
The Magic Seal system is a new feature introduced in ''Dawn of Sorrow'', and makes use of the Nintendo DS#Input and output|DS stylus.; Once the player reduces the hit points of a &quot;boss&quot; enemy to zero, a circle will appear, and the game will automatically draw a pattern connecting any number of smaller circles on the circumference of the larger circle.;; After this, the player will be prompted to draw the same pattern using the DS stylus in a set amount of time.; If the player fails to draw the pattern in time or correctly, then the boss will regain health and the battle will resume.;; If successful, the boss will be defeated.; More powerful boss enemies require higher level Magic Seals, which have more intricate and complex patterns as the level increases and are found over the course of the game.

=Julius Mode=
After the player completes the game, Julius Mode is unlocked, similar to the Julius Mode in ''Aria of Sorrow''.; Julius Mode, in storyline terms, follows the assumption that Soma succumbed to his dark power, and became the new dark lord.; Julius Belmont: &quot;So...Soma has become the dark lord. I have no other choice...The battles of the past are to be waged once again...&quot; / Genya Arikado: &quot;I had assumed that he would have equipped the talisman from Mina... It would have protected him. But alas, I will have to unleash my power...&quot; ; A new game can then be started from the main menu in Julius Mode.;; In Julius Mode, the playable characters include Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Julius Belmont|Julius Belmont, Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Yoko Belnades|Yoko Belnades, and Alucard.;; Each character has a weapon and an assortment of abilities unique to them, and although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters' statistics can improve by acquiring enough experience points to level up.; The castle layout and enemies are the same, with the exception of the final battle, which is against Soma.; Julius Belmont: &quot;Soma... It's time I fulfilled my promise to you.&quot; / Yoko Belnades: &quot;I'm sorry, Soma. I will free you from your torment.&quot; / Alucard: &quot;Soma...I never wanted it to end this way...But I can't allow you to wreak havoc anymore...&quot; ;

Plot
=Setting=
''Dawn of Sorrow'' is set in the fictional universe of the ''Castlevania'' series. The primary premise of the series is the eternal struggle of the vampire hunters of the List of Castlevania characters#The Belmont clan|Belmont clan against the immortal vampire Dracula. Before the events of ''Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow'', Dracula was defeated and his castle sealed within a solar eclipse.;; A prophecy relating to who would inherit Dracula's powers drove the events of ''Aria of Sorrow'', with the protagonist, Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Soma Cruz|Soma Cruz, realizing that he was Dracula's reincarnation.; Soma: &quot;So...you are trying to tell me now that Dracula has been resurrected?&quot; / Graham: &quot;No. Dracula perished in 1999. You do know of the prophecy of 1999, don't you?&quot; / Soma: &quot;Nostradamus' great prophecy?&quot; / Graham: &quot;That's right. Dracula resurrected exactly as he predicted. But vampire hunters destroyed him completely. They ended his regeneration cycle by sealing his castle...the symbol of his demonic power, inside the darkness of an eclipse.&quot; / Soma: &quot;And that eclipse is where we are now?&quot; / Graham: &quot;Yes, but there's still more to the story.&quot; / Soma: &quot;There's more?&quot; / Graham: &quot;In the year 2035, a new master will come to the castle, and he will inherit ALL of Dracula's powers.&quot; ;;; Soma manages to escape his fate of becoming the new dark lord with the help of his allies.; ''Dawn of Sorrow'' takes place one year after the events of ''Aria of Sorrow'', where Soma believes that his inherited powers have been lost.; Mina Hakuba: &quot;And what was it called? You know, the ability to use the power of monsters?&quot; / Soma Cruz: &quot;You mean the power of dominance? I lost it when we escaped Dracula's Castle, remember?&quot; ; The majority of the game is played inside a copy of Dracula's castle, which is further subdivided into several areas that the player must venture through over the course of the game.; The futuristic setting of both ''Aria of Sorrow'' and ''Dawn of Sorrow'', as well as starting a storyline after Dracula's defeat, was a result of Koji Igarashi wanting to take a &quot;different route&quot; with ''Aria of Sorrow''.; Although ''Dawn of Sorrow'' is set in 2036, the castle and weaponry encountered in the game are medieval in nature.;

Soma Cruz, the protagonist of ''Dawn of Sorrow''. The anime design used here is a significant departure from the designs usually used in the series.

=Characters=

The primary playable character in ''Dawn of Sorrow'' is Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Soma Cruz|Soma Cruz, the reincarnation of Dracula, the longtime antagonist of the ''Castlevania'' series.;; He is supported in his quest by Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Mina Hakuba|Mina Hakuba, the daughter of the priest of the Hakuba shrine; Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Genya Arikado|Genya Arikado, a mysterious government agent dealing primarily with the supernatural; Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Julius Belmont|Julius Belmont, the latest member of the List of Castlevania characters#The Belmont clan|Belmont clan of vampire hunters featured in the series; Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Yoko Belnades|Yoko Belnades, a witch in the service of the Roman Catholic Church; and Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Hammer|Hammer, a vendor of military material who retains a large information network.;

A cult, dedicated to the resurrection of the dark lord, serves as the game's antagonists. Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Celia Fortner|Celia Fortner is a shadow priestess at the head of the cult, and seeks to revive the dark lord in order to prevent the loss of her magical powers.; Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Dmitrii Blinov|Dmitrii Blinov and Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Dario Bossi|Dario Bossi are Celia's primary lieutenants, the former a ruthless manipulator and the latter a vicious firebrand.; They are the &quot;dark lord's candidates,&quot; born on the day Dracula was slain, and thus can assume the mantle of dark lord by destroying Dracula's soul, which is present in Soma Cruz.; Soma Cruz: &quot;So those two are the dark lord's candidates...&quot; / Celia Fortner: &quot;Correct. They were born at the same time as Dracula's demise. They are inheritors of Dracula's dark powers.&quot; / Soma Cruz: &quot;But that's no guarantee that they can become the dark lord.&quot; / Celia Fortner: &quot;They can. By shattering Dracula's soul.&quot; ;

Unlike most recent ''Castlevania'' games, Ayami Kojima did not participate in the character designs for ''Dawn of Sorrow''.; Instead, the characters were drawn in a distinctive anime style. This was done due to influence from producer Koji Igarashi, who wanted to market the game to a younger audience.; Kojima's hiatus was to allow her to concentrate upon her character designs for ''Castlevania: Curse of Darkness''.;

=Story=
One year after the events in ''Aria of Sorrow'', Soma is living peacefully, and believes that his powers have been lost.; A woman who identifies herself as Celia Fortner, appears and summons several monsters. Arikado arrives to help Soma defeat the monsters, after which Soma absorbs their souls. Celia retreats, proclaiming that she will destroy Soma. Soma expresses disbelief at the return of his powers, but Arikado reveals that he never lost them.; Soma Cruz: &quot;Yeah, I'm fine. But that power...It returned! Arikado, what's going on?&quot; / Genya Arikado: &quot;The power didn't &quot;return.&quot; It was always with you. You just never had a need for it since you fled the castle. And that set free all the souls that you had gained dominance over.&quot; ; He informs Soma that Celia is the head of a cult that seeks the resurrection of the dark lord.; Genya Arikado: &quot;They want to resurrect the lord of darkness. Like some sought to do with Dracula.&quot; / Soma Cruz: &quot;I guess they don't like the fact that I didn't become the 'lord of darkness'.&quot; / Genya Arikado: &quot;Not only that, they intend to create a new lord by eliminating you.&quot; ; He leaves, instructing Soma not to pursue Celia.

Soma, however, uses information acquired from Hammer to locate the cult's base, a facsimile of Dracula's castle.; Soma Cruz: &quot;So, the cult's base is here. Hammer's info wasn't so iffy after all.&quot; ; Hammer arrives, and as he has left the military, agrees to be Soma's vendor.; Hammer: &quot;Aw, man... Well, since I'm here, I'd better make the best of it. I guess I'm back in business, and you're my customer!&quot; ; After entering the castle, Soma encounters Yoko and Julius Belmont. As Julius leaves, Soma escorts Yoko to a safe location. During this time, she instructs him in the use of a Magic Seal, which is necessary to defeat certain monsters in the castle.; Yoko Belnades: &quot;The cult leader appears to create gates that draw the power of darkness. Monsters exposed to that power are said to be invincible.&quot; Soma Cruz: &quot;So how am I supposed to destroy them?&quot; / Yoko Belnades: &quot;That's where this Magic Seal comes in.&quot; ; As Soma travels farther into the castle, he meets Celia, who is flanked by two men, Dmitrii Blinov and Dario Bossi. Celia explains their nature as the &quot;dark lord's candidates,&quot; who can become the dark lord by destroying Soma.; He later encounters Dmitrii and is able to defeat him. Soma gains dominance over his soul, although he acquires no abilities.; Soma Cruz: &quot;Unh! What was that? Did I gain dominance over a human soul? No, I gained no power... But...what was that light?&quot; ; As Soma travels further, he comes upon Dario. Soma bests him, and Celia teleports Dario away from harm.

Soma meets Arikado, who is initially angered by Soma's presence, but accepts the situation. He gives Soma a letter and a talisman from Mina. Soma briefs Arikado on the current situation, and Arikado leaves to locate Dario. Soma comes upon Dario and Julius, with the latter defeated due to his inability to use a Magic Seal.; Julius Belmont: &quot;Watch it. He's tough. Especially for me, since I can't use Magic Seals.&quot; ; Dario retreats, instructing Soma to fight him in the castle's throne room. Soma does so, lambasting Dario for only desiring power, and promising to defeat him.; Soma Cruz: &quot;Was there ever any doubt? Power is nothing if you don't know how to use it. I'll never lose to a fool dominated by his own power like you.&quot; ; Before the battle begins, Soma uses one of his souls to transport himself into the mirror in the room, revealing Aguni, the fire demon sealed to Dario's soul. Soma defeats Aguni, leaving Dario powerless. As Dario flees, Celia arrives, and instructs Soma to come to the castle's center.

Upon arriving, Soma is forced to watch Celia kill Mina. Furious, he begins to succumb to his dark power.; Soma Cruz: &quot;If it means getting Mina's revenge, I'll do it. Make me the dark lord.&quot; ; The talisman that Mina gave Soma is able to slow the transformation, enabling Arikado to arrive in time to inform Soma that the &quot;Mina&quot; that Celia killed was a doppleg√§nger.; Genya Arikado: &quot;That Mina is a fake!&quot; / Celia Fortner: &quot;Arikado! Why must you always get in the way?&quot; / Genya Arikado: &quot;How clever of you to use a Doppelganger. Ah, but you haven't won just yet...&quot; ; This aborts the transformation, but a soul exits Soma and enters the doppleg√§nger, which takes on the appearance of Dmitrii. Dmitrii states that he died as a gambit to copy Soma's power of dominance, and leaves with Celia to increase his strength by absorbing the souls of additional demons.; Genya Arikado: &quot;You copied the power of dominance from Soma?&quot; / Dmitrii Blinov: &quot;Ah, so you understand. I touched the boy's soul and copied his ability.&quot; ; Soma and Arikado chase after the two, and find them in the castle's basement. Dmitrii, using Celia as a sacrifice, seals Arikado's powers, and engages Soma. However, his soul is unable to bear the strain of controlling the demons he has absorbed, and they erupt out of him, combining into a gargantuan creature. Soma manages to defeat the creature, but the souls that composed the demon begin to fall under Soma's dominance. He rejects them, and flees the castle with Arikado. Soma is conflicted over the present situation, as he believes it is fated that he will become the dark lord, but Arikado convinces him that his fate is not fixed.; Soma Cruz: &quot;Then that means there will always be a need for a dark lord. All because I ducked out from becoming the next in line!&quot; / Genya Arikado: &quot;Don't misconstrue me! Perhaps there is a need for the dark lord...But there is no reason at all for you to become the dark lord.&quot; / Soma Cruz: &quot;But if it weren't for me, none of this would have happened!&quot; / Genya Arikado: &quot;You're neither a god nor a demon. You're only human. You have no chance at ever achieving perfection. Or are you saying you want to be the dark lord?&quot; / Soma Cruz: &quot;No...Of course not.&quot; ; Soma then shares a tender moment with Mina, much to the amusement of the onlookers.

Development
The production of ''Dawn of Sorrow'' was announced on January 6, 2005 as the first ''Castlevania'' game to be released on the Nintendo DS.;; Longtime ''Castlevania'' producer Koji Igarashi was in charge of the production.;In an interview, Igarashi commented that he felt that the storyline with Soma Cruz and the Tactical Soul system were a waste to only use in one game, contributing to his desire to make a sequel.;; The choice to use the Nintendo DS in favor of the Sony PlayStation Portable was due to ''Aria of Sorrow'';';s success on Nintendo's Game Boy Advance, and Igarashi's observations during the 2005 E3 Media and Business Summit of both consoles.;; The original design team from ''Aria of Sorrow'', as well as numerous new additions from Konami#Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo|Konami Tokyo, was involved in the production of ''Dawn of Sorrow''.;

The use of the technical features of the Nintendo DS was one of the production team's principle concerns during development.; The DS touch screen was a primary point of interest, and several functions, such as picking up items on the screen and moving them, were originally intended to be incorporated.; However, scheduling problems forced the development team to abandon many of these ideas.; Igarashi's primary concern with using the touch screen was that it would detract from &quot;the ''Castlevania'' pure action gameplay,&quot; in which the player would have to slow down play in order to use the stylus.;; The Nintendo DS#Input and output|DS microphone was looked at during development, but Igarashi noted that although he found humorous uses for it, it was never seriously considered for inclusion into the game.;

The change from the traditional dark, gothic character design of many previous ''Castlevania'' games to a new anime style was a choice made by Igarashi, who wished to market the game to a younger audience.; Igarashi believed that the Nintendo DS inherently attracted a younger audience, and he was working to court them with the anime style.;; Furthermore, Igarashi considered the anime style a litmus test for whether future ''Castlevania'' games would incorporate it.;; Igarashi had additionally intended to include a white collar Japanese worker in the game.; This worker would be a manager in a Japanese firm and have a family as well.; However, the development team's opposition to this idea forced him to drop this prospect.; For the graphical representations of the numerous enemies featured in the game, Igarashi had sprites from previous ''Castlevania'' games such as ''Castlevania: Symphony of the Night'' reused, and the development team redesigned them for use on the Nintendo DS.;

=Audio=
The game's music was composed by Michiru Yamane and Masahiko Kimura.; Yamane, a longtime composer of music for the ''Castlevania'' series, had previously worked on the music of ''Castlevania'' games such as ''Symphony of the Night'' and ''Aria of Sorrow'',;; while Kimura had developed the music for ''Castlevania'' on the Nintendo 64.;; In an interview, Yamane noted that she made the music &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;easy to recognize,&quot; similar to her work on previous ''Castlevania'' games, and she specifically drew a parallel between her work on ''Castlevania'' games for the Game Boy Advance and her music in ''Dawn of Sorrow''.;; Igarashi, present in the interview, asserted that making music for handheld game consoles, regardless of the type, is largely the same, although he accepted that the DS's sound capabilities were much better than those of the Game Boy Advance's.;

;
''Dawn of Sorrow'' has received critical acclaim from many video game publications, with several hailing it as the best Nintendo DS game of 2005. Metacritic, a site that compiles scores from many video game publications, gave ''Dawn of Sorrow'' a composite score of 89/100 based on 52 reviews.;; ''Famitsu'', considered to be the most respected video game news magazine in Japan,;;;; as well as notorious for its &quot;extremely harsh&quot; reviews,;
;;
; gave ''Dawn of Sorrow'' a 33/40.;; In Japan, the game sold over 15,000 units in its first week, acquiring the number ten slot in software sales.; The game was re-released on June 29, 2006 as part of Konami's &quot;Konami the Best&quot; line.; The game sold well in the United States, garnering over 164,000 total sales three months after its release.; 

Many reviewers noted that despite being highly similar to ''Aria of Sorrow'', it managed to define itself as a standalone title. GameSpot commented that ''Dawn of Sorrow'' succeeded in continuing 2D games as a definite genre, and that it &quot;keeps that flame burning as bright as ever.&quot;; In addition, GameSpot considered it for the accolade of best Nintendo DS game of 2005, with the prize ultimately going to ''Mario Kart DS''.;; Editors at IGN awarded ''Dawn of Sorrow'' the prize of best adventure game on the DS for 2005.;; 

The gameplay, the Tactical Soul system in particular, received praise from reviewers. The sheer depth of abilities from the numerous souls found in the game was lauded, and IGN believed that the ability to have two customizable &quot;profiles&quot; of different abilities was &quot;an extremely handy idea.&quot;;; The necessity of finding multiple souls in order to strengthen abilities was criticized, with G4's ''X-Play'' claiming it was &quot;something more along the lines of ''Pok√©mon video game series|Pok√©mon'' than ''Castlevania'',&quot; and that &quot;[the soul collecting system] is not for everyone.&quot;;; The relative difficulty of the game and its length was also brought into question, with GameSpot noting that the game could be finished in five hours and &quot;is fairly easy as far as ''Castlevania'' games go.&quot;;

GameSpot extolled the game's animation and graphics, describing the backgrounds as &quot;intricate and gorgeous&quot; and the individual animation, especially of enemies, as one of the game's &quot;highlights.&quot;; IGN echoed this assessment, calling the animation &quot;stunning and fluid,&quot; and noted the differences in graphics between ''Aria of Sorrow'' and ''Dawn of Sorrow'', stating that the latter was on a &quot;broader and more impressive scale.&quot;; The utilization of an anime style of drawing the characters, as versus the traditional gothic presentation of illustrator Ayami Kojima in previous ''Castlevania'' games, was lambasted by reviewers. GameSpy deplored the &quot;shallow, lifeless anime images&quot; used for the characters and Kojima's absence from the production.; IGN believed the new images were &quot;down to the level of 'generic Saturday morning Anime' quality.&quot;; The audio by Michiru Yamane and Masahiko Kimura was highly regarded, with GameSpot stating that it was &quot;heads and shoulders above [''Aria of Sorrow''].&quot;; IGN noted that the DS dual speaker system presented the audio &quot;extraordinarily well.&quot;; In the review from 1UP.com, the game's score was compared to the soundtrack of ''Symphony of the Night'', and the sound quality and compositions considered &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;exceptional&quot; respectively.;

The functionality associated with the Nintendo DS, namely the use of the touch screen and the Magic Seal system, was subject to criticism from reviewers. GameSpot noted that it was difficult to use the stylus immediately after the game prompted the player to draw the Magic Seal, thus forcing the player to use their fingernail on the touch screen.; Other functions using the touch screen, including clearing ice blocks, were viewed as trivial, with GameSpy labeling it as a &quot;gimmick.&quot;; However, IGN dismissed the lack of DS functionality as a major issue, claiming that it &quot;doesn't hurt the product in the slightest.&quot;;
