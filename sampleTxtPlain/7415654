&quot;Wind It Up&quot; is apop rap song written by Gwen Stefani and Pharrell Williams originally for inclusion on Stefani's Harajuku Lovers Tour 2005.Because of favorable reception, the song was later recorded for her second solo album ''The Sweet Escape'' (2006).The track includes an interpolation of ''The Sound of Music'' song &quot;The Lonely Goatherd&quot;.

&quot;Wind It Up&quot; was panned by music critics, who criticized the song's use of yodeling and found the track to be over the top.The track was released as the album's lead single in late 2006 (see 2006 in music) and reached the top twenty in most music markets.
