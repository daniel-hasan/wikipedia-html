The lawful definition of pornography in the US evolved through decades, from 1960s. In this period, recognizing ambiguities, it was chosen to use the term &quot;sexually explicit content&quot; as one of the pornography's euphemisms,;''Youth, Pornography and the Internet'', National Academy Press, 2002.

Overview
American pornography refers mainly to the internet, adult movies, publications (with mainstream journals ''Playboy'', ''Penthouse'' and ''Hustler'') and pay-per-view broadcasting. The so-called portable porn market is in its initial stage in the US.;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/14/AR2005111401456_pf.html WashingtonPost.com Mini-Porn Could Be Mega-Business]; Cellphone companies are reluctant to become partners with the adult entertainment for fear of being stigmatised by community standards.;[http://iafrica.com/loveandsex/features/558204.htm Porn industry goes high tech (15 Feb 2006)];

The 1979 Revision of the Federal Criminal Code stated that &quot;in Los Angeles alone, the porno business does $100 million a year in gross retain volume&quot; while &quot;the average porno magazine sells for between $6 and $10 each&quot;. According to the 1986 Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, American adult entertainment industry has grown considerably over the past thirty years by continually changing and expanding to appeal to new markets, though the production is considered to be low-profile and clandestine.;Louis Fisher. ''American Constitutional Law''. 1995, ISBN 0-07-021223-6; The total income of modern country's adult entertainment is often rated at $10-13 billion,;CBS, [http://www.washprofile.org/en Washington ProFile]; of which 4-6 billion are legal. The figure is often credited to a study by Forrester Research and was lowered in 1998.;[http://www.forbes.com/2001/05/25/0524porn.html Forbes.com How Big Is Porn?]; Other sources, quoted by Forbes (Adams Media Research, Veronis Suhler Communications Industry Report, IVD), even taking into consideration all possible means (video networks and pay-per-view movies on cable and satellite, web sites, in-room hotel movies, phone sex, sex toys and magazines) mention the $2.6-3.9 billion figure (without the cellphone component). ''USA Today'' claimed in 2003 that websites such as [http://www.danni.com/ Danni's Hard Drive] and [http://www.cybererotica.com/ Cybererotica.com] generated $2 billion in revenue in that year, which was allegedly about 10% of the overall domestic porn market at the time.;[http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2004-03-09-onlineporn_x.htm USATODAY.com Online porn often leads high-tech way]; The adult movies income (from sale and rent) was once estimated by &quot;AVN Publications&quot; at $4.3 billion but the figure obtaining is unclear.

''The Online Journalism Review'', published by the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Southern California, weighed in with an analysis that favored Forbes' number. The financial extent of adult films, distributed in hotels, is hard to estimate — hotels keep statistics to themselves or don't keep them at all.;[http://www.usatoday.com/travel/hotels/2006-09-06-hotel-pornography_x.htm USATODAY.com Groups protest porn on hotel TVs]; A CBS News investigation in November, 2003 claimed that 50% of guests at the Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, Sheraton and Holiday Inn hotel chains purchased adult movies, contributing to 70% of in-room profits. The income of cellphone porn is low, being compared with other countries. The absence of V-chip-style parental controls largely has kept American consumers from using cellphones to access explicit content. Porn star Ron Jeremy licensed his name to &quot;RJ Mobile&quot;, which offers adult content in Britain and The Netherlands.

The term &quot;pornography&quot; (from Greek πόρνη (pórnē), a prostitute) first comes from an 1857 British medical dictionary, which defined it as &quot;a description of prostitutes or of prostitution, as a matter of public hygiene&quot;,;Walter Kendrick.

The dictionary introduced the entry in 1864, defining it primarily as a &quot;treatment of, or a treatise on, the subject of prostitutes or prostitution&quot;. Early charges used the term &quot;obscenity&quot; as well as after ''Miller v. California'', though the term &quot;pornography&quot; remained as a reference entry:

During the Warren Court (1953-1969), the first notable to face the cases of such kind, justices Potter Stewart, Byron White and Arthur Goldberg shared the opinion that only hardcore pornography was not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.;Michal R.

Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. Report. 1970; In this period the Court considered pornography to have two major dimensions. The first can be defined as dealing with sexual representations that are offensive to public morality or taste, which concerned the Court notably in the 1966 Ginzburg v. United States case. The second centers on the effect of pornography on specific individuals or classes, which is the focus of most public discussions and prior Court pornography decisions. This dimension was mentioned only twice in the array of decisions made in 1966. A frustration was expressed notably by Justice Hugo Black in the 1966 Mishkin v. New York: &quot;I wish once more to express my objections to saddling this Court with the irksome and inevitably unpopular and unwholesome task of finally deciding by a case-by-case, sight-by-sight personal judgment of the members of this Court what pornography (whatever that means) is too hard core for people to see or read.&quot;;[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/speech/adultent/topic.aspx?topic=pornography FirstAmendmentCenter.org Adult Entertainment in Speech]; In the 1974 Hamling v.

Since determining what is pornography and what is &quot;soft core&quot; and &quot;hard core&quot; are subjective questions to judges, juries and law enforcement officials, it is difficult to define, since the law cases cannot print examples for the courts to follow.;''The People's Law Dictionary''; The Rehnquist Court further enhanced the power of community controls on pornography.;Robert Singh.

This kind of material is often labeled as &quot;adult&quot; and the appropriate disclaimers are common.

The so-called &quot;sex wars&quot; of the late seventies;Henry L. Minton. ''Gay and Lesbian Studies''. 1993, ISBN 1-56024-307-4; challenged the traditional understanding of the gender role.

Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon became well-known often-cited anti-pornography authors. Many debates have attended their political intervention into the law by way of their advocacy of anti-pornography ordinances in several midwestern cities. Other notable American anti-pornography activists to belong to this camp are Robin Morgan and Susan Griffin. Ordinary libertarians, who separate sex and violence, take MacKinnon and Dworkin to task for their refusal to leave sexual expression alone.;Thomas L. Dumm. ''United States''. 1994, ISBN 0-8014-3002-X; This was done particularly by Gillian Rodgerson and Elizabeth Wilson in ''Pornography and Feminism: The Case Against Censorship'': &quot;Yet this theoretical cocktail of biologism and behaviourism is lethal. To see men as naturally programmed for violence is to endorse the most conservative views on human nature, and to see it as unchanging and unchangeable&quot;. Rodgerson and Wilson argue that pornography plays a relatively minor role in the wider regime of sexist practices pervading women's lives.;Per ''Approaches to Popular Film'', ed. by Joanne Hollows and Mark Jancovich. 1995, ISBN 0-7190-4393-X;

The famous Indianapolis definition of pornography by Dworkin and MacKinnon paralleled their Minneapolis ordinance. The first was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for several reasons. The ordinance did not use any of the accepted terms that the Supreme Court had developed over time for determining when material is obscene, including &quot;prurient interest&quot;, &quot;offensiveness&quot; or &quot;local community standarts&quot;.;''Moral Controversies In American Politics: Cases in Social Regulatory Policy'', ed. by Raymond Tatlovich and Byron W. Daynes. 2004, ISBN 0-7656-1420-0; Another concern was the way the women were depicted in the work. If women were referred to in the approved fashion stressing equality, the activity involved would be regardless of how sexually explicit it was.; The Court also indicated that if women were referred to in a disapproving way depicting them as subversive or as enjoying humiliation, the activity would be unlawful regardless of the &quot;literary, artistic or political qualities of the work taken as a whole&quot;.; Judge Frank Easterbrook said: &quot;We accept the premises of this legislation. Depictions of subordination tend to perpetuate subordination. The subordinate status of women in turn leads to affront and lower pay at work, insult and injury at home, battery and rape on the streets... but... this simply demonstrates the power of pornography as speech.&quot;;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pornography-censorship/notes.html#2 Plato.Stanford.edu ''Pornography and Censorship'' by Caroline West first published Wed 5 May, 2004]; ''Conceptions of Democracy in American Constitutional Argument: The Case of Pornography Regulation'' by Frank Michelman, issued by Tennessee Law Review (vol. 56, no. 291, 1989) partially consented that &quot;pornography is political expression in that it promulgates a certain view of women's natures and thus of women's appropriate relations and treatment in society&quot;, but also concluded that the Indianopolis ordinance was precisely designed to suppress that particular view by censoring pornography. Minneapolis ordinance was struck down on the grounds that it was ambiguous and vague, however despite of its failure the proposal influenced other communities across America.;

Another matter, which frequently circulates in American anti-pornography movement is a close bond of pornography with rape. According to ''Porn Up, Rape Down'' by Northwestern University Law Professor Anthony D’amato, &quot;the incidence of rape in the United States has declined 85 per cent in the past 25 years while access to pornography has become freely available to teenagers and adults&quot;. Recognizing that the Nixon and Reagan Commissions tried to show that exposure to pornographic materials produced social violence, D'amato concludes that &quot;the reverse may be true: that pornography has reduced social violence&quot;. D'amato suggests there are two predominant reasons why an increase in the availability of pornography has led to a reduction in rape. First, using pornographic material provides an easy avenue for the sexually desirous to &quot;get it out of their system&quot;. Second, D'amato points to the so-called &quot;Victorian effect&quot;. It dates back to the British Victorian era where people covered up their bodies with an immense amount of clothing, generating a greater mystery as to what they looked like naked. D'amato suggests that the free availability of pornography since the 1970s, and the recent bombardment of internet pornography, has de-mystified sex, thus satisfying the sexually curious.;[http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=4845 ''Pornography has its benefits'' by James McConvill; posted Friday, 29 September 2006];

Movies and pay-per-view

Much of the pornography produced in the United States is in the form of movies and the branch acutely competes with the internet. The market is very diverse and ranges from the mainstream heterosexual content to the rarefied S/M, BDSM, interracial sex, ethnic, etc. through enduringly popular gay porn.

Early American stag films included ''Wonders of the Unseen World'' (1927), ''An Author's True Story'' (1933), ''Goodyear'' (1950s), ''Smart Alec'' (1951) and ''Playmates'' (1956-58). The breakthrough films such as 1972 ''Deep Throat'' and 1978 ''Debbie Does Dallas'', that launched the so-called porno chic, put the adult movies production onto the commercialization. ; Dubious-->; In this period America's most notorious pornographer was Reuben Sturman. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, throughout the 1970s Sturman controlled most of the pornography circulating in the country.

The country now houses over 40 adult movies studios featuring heterosexual scenes;List_of_pornographic_film_studios;, more than any other country. The branch, according to founder and president of ''Adult Video News'' Paul Fishbein involves the manufacturers of adult products, distributors, suppliers, retail store owners, wholesalers, distributors, cable TV buyers and foreign buyers. The production is concentrated in San Fernando Valley (mainly in Chatsworth and Reseda) and Las Vegas, where more than 200 adult entertainment companies gather to network, schmooze and show off their latest wares.;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/11/21/60minutes/main585049.shtml CBSNews.com Porn In The U.S.A.];; The world's largest adult movies studio, Vivid Entertainment generates an estimated $100 million a year in revenue, cranking out 60 films annually;[http://www.forbes.com/business/2005/03/07/cz_bp_0307vivid.html Forbes.com The Porn King]; and selling them in video stores, hotel rooms, on cable systems and on the Internet. Vivid's two largest regional competitors are Wicked Pictures and Digital Playground. Colorado-based New Frontier Media, a leading distributor of adult movies (at NASDAQ since November, 2000) is one of the two adult video companies traded publicly, the another one being Spanish Private Media Group.

The industry's decision to embrace VHS in the early 1980s, for example, helped to do away with Sony Betamax, despite the latter format's superior quality. Video rentals soared from just under 80 million in 1985 to half-billion by 1993.;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2003/06/01/343376/index.htm Money.CNN.com Prime-Time Porn Borrowing tactics from the old Hollywood studios...]; Suffering at the hands of video warez tended not be publicly stressed by country's film industry.;Peter Drahos, John Braithwaite. ''Information Feudalism: Who Owns the Knowledge Economy?'' 2002.

In the recent years, according to Fishbein, there are well over 800 million rentals of adult videotapes and DVDs in video stores across the country. 

Now there is a debate on two future formats: the Blu-ray Disc and HD-DVD. Digital Playground said it is choosing the Blu-ray Disc for all of its &quot;interactive&quot; films because of its greater capacity.;[http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/05/02/pornhd/index.php?lsrc=mwrss Macworld.com Porn industry may be decider in Blu-ray, HD-DVD battle]; The female demographic is considered to be the biggest catalyst for pornographic cultural crossover.;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/07/25/CMGF77DFT31.DTL ''San Francisco Chronicle'', July 25, 2004 ''Porn Plague: Has porn's proliferation desensitized us to its power?'' by Andi Zeisler]; According to Adella O'Neal, a Digital Playground publicist, in 2000 roughly 9% of the company's consumers were women while four years later that figure has bloomed to 53%.

American adult pay-per-view television is presently unregulated since it is not technically &quot;broadcasting&quot; as defined in the Federal Communications Act. Cable and satellite television networks host about six main adult-related channels. Most of them (particularly Playboy TV, Penthouse TV and Hustler TV (there is also a &quot;Hustler Video&quot;, a line of raunchy films created by Larry Flynt)) are maintained by three mainstream porn magazines. In 1999 Playboy Enterprises sold to Vivid Entertainment a small channel which was renamed to Hot Network. Since that Vivid launched two more channels - the Hot Zone and Vivid TV. The viewers paid close to $400 million a year to tune in to Vivid's hardcore content and the company soon overtook Playboy as operator of the world's largest adult-TV network. However, after passing the 2000 United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group case Playboy bought all three networks from Vivid in 2001 and folded them into &quot;Playboy's Spice&quot; brand. Operators then shunned &quot;Playboy's Spice Platinum&quot;, a new group of channels with graphic hardcore fare.;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DIZ/is_21_13/ai_75120095 ''Cable World'', May 21, 2001 ''Playboy's New Porn Channels Are Too Spicy For Some'' by Andrea Figler];

Some subsidiaries of major corporations are the largest pornography sellers, like News Corporation's Direct TV. Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, once pulled in $50 million from adult programming. Revenues of companies such as Playboy and Hustler were small by comparison.;[http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/commercial-alert/2000/000042.html ''New York Times'', October 23, 2000 ''Wall Street Meets Pornography'' by Timothy Egan];
 
=HIV encounter=
With the onset of AIDS in the 1980s, HIV transmission between performers resulted in a number of deaths, including that of the famous porn actor John Holmes. Although the pornography industry did not promote safe sex, it instituted a system of HIV testing designed to prevent the spread of the virus within the industry. Following an HIV outbreak in 1998 claiming several of her coworkers, a former porn actress Sharon Mitchell, who reports earning a Ph.D. in &quot;human sexuality' on her website, has founded the Adult Industry Medical (AIM) Health Care Foundation to serve the health care needs of industry workers, including HIV and gynecological testing, and psychological counseling. However, in April 2004, the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services received several reports of work-related exposure to HIV in the heterosexual segment of the adult film industry in California. The source was apparently in Brazil.;[http://www.hivdent.org/mmwr/mmwrHTAF0905.htm HIVdent.org HIV Transmission in the Adult Film Industry - Los Angeles, California, 2004];

Publications
American adult magazines which have the widest distribution do not violate the Miller test and can be legally distributed.;[http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/probe/docs/pornplag.html ''The Pornography Plague'' by Kerby Anderson]; Adult magazines have been largely put into mainstream by the pioneer ''Playboy''. However during the so-called Pubic Wars in 1960s and 1970s ''Penthouse'' established itself as a more explicit magazine. By the mid-'90s magazines like ''Playboy'' had become noncompetitive and even hardcore publications like ''Penthouse'' and ''Hustler'' struggled. According to Laura Kipnis, a cultural theorist and critic, &quot;the ''Hustler'' body is an unromanticized body - no vaselined lens or soft focus: this is neither the airbrushed top-heavy fantasy body of ''Playboy'', nor the ersatz opulence, the lingeried and sensitive crotch shots of ''Penthouse'', transforming female genitals into ''objets d'art''. It's a body, not a surface or a suntan: insistently material, defiantly vulgar, corporeal&quot;.;Per ''Photography: A Critical Introduction'', ed. by Liz Wells. Routledge, 2000, p. 230. ISBN 0-415-19058-4;

Many adult magazines in the United States are now highlighted by special features and are usually sold wrapped to avoid their look-see by the under-age persons. A primarily softcore ''Barely Legal'' focuses on models between 18 and 23 years. ''Hustler's Leg World'' is focused on the female legs and feet. ''Perfect 10'' publishes the images of women, untouched by plastic surgery or airbrushing.

Pornographic bookstores have been subject to zoning laws in the US.;Susan Easton. ''The Problem of Pornography: Regulation and the Right to Free Speech''. 1994, ISBN 0-415-09182-9;

Video games and Japanese influence

Microsoft has long declined to license development software to game makers whose titles include sexual content. Wal-Mart, America's largest distributor of video games, maintains the policy of selling no games with an AO rating.;[http://money.cnn.com/2004/05/11/technology/e3_nekkidgames/index.htm Money.CNN.com Video games get raunchy]; However in recent years the pornographic content in video games has been promoted particularly by Playboy. ''Playboy: The Mansion'' became the first game built around the &quot;Playboy&quot; license.;[http://money.cnn.com/2004/08/25/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/ Money.CNN.com Video game gals take it off for Playboy]; In ''Playboys softcore line of the video games heroines Rayne was the only featured undressed atop (October, 2004 issue).

A downloadable mod -- &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; -- developed by Dutch hacker Patrick Wildenborg in 2004, according to Jason Della Rocca, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, accelerated the need to discuss the challenges faced in creating games with pornographic content. The two-day San Francisco gathering was held in June, 2006 to delve into the design, development and technology of sex in video games, also in the United States.;[http://www.sexinvideogames.com/ Sexinvideogames.com];

The much-anticpated and wildy popular video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; was pulled from shelves by Rockstar Games after it became public knowledge that, with the use of a Gameshark, a scene can be unlocked portraying the protagonist having sex with another character.In the scene both characters have their clothes on.

Playstation 2 video game ''God of War'' features an event in the first part of the game where protagonist Kratos can have sex with two topless prostitutes, who reside in a bedroom on his boat. Although no sexual acts are depicted (they occur off-screen and are indicated by sound effects), the women are shown topless. The player interacts by performing button and joystick commands that appear on screen which results in an experience reward for the player.

The adult sections of American comic book stores carry a large number of translations of Japanese hardcore comics, as well as an increasing number of home imitations.;''Porn Studies'', ed. by Linda Williams, 2004. ISBN 0-8223-3312-0; 

One of the anime porn movies, which started the American adult video market, was ''Urotsukidoji''. The adult anime market exists primarily through direct sales: mail-order to customers, and wholesale to specialty shops which cater to anime and to comic-book fans.;[http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.4/3.4pages/3.4patten.html Fred Patten.

Notes
aIn the 1969 ''Stanley v. Georgia'' case (later followed by the 1971 ''United States v. Reidel'') the Supreme Court ruled that private possession of pornography (except child pornography as determined in 1990 by a 6 to 3 decision;;''Proliferation of Child Pornography on the Internet''. 1997, ISBN 0-16-055747-X;) in the home was not a crime, nor was it subject to government regulation. Technically why people have a constitutional right to watch hardcore pornography privately has never been explained,;Jethro Koller Lieberman, ''A Practical Companion to the Constitution'', 1999, ISBN 0-520-21280-0; but in the 1973 ''Paris Adult Theatre v. Slaton'' Chief Justice Burger wrote: &quot;We categorically disapprove the theory... that obscene, pornographic films acquire constitutional immunity... simply because they are exhibited for consenting adults only&quot;.;Stephen L. Newman. ''Constitutional Politics in Canada and the United States''. 2004, ISBN 0-7914-5937-3; ''Miller v. California'' held 5-4 that the state may outlaw the showing of hardcore pornographic films, even if the &quot;adult theatre&quot; is clearly labeled and warns.

b.The sex tourism involving minors outside the U.S. is also illegal.;18 U.S.C. 2423B;

c.The term &quot;dial-a-porn&quot; was used at the federal level e.g. by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ;Robert E. Emeritz. ''Telecommunications Act of 1996'', section 228 (h). ISBN 0-937275-07-7;, but it was partially voided by federal courts over subsequent years.;Robert Singh. ''American Government and Politics''. 2003, ISBN 0-7619-4094-4; Another term usage includes the 1996 ''Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium v. Federal Communications Commission'' certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=u20031 Caselaw.lp.FindLaw.com Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium, Inc., et al. v. Federal Communications Commission et al.];

dThe transportation of pornography in interstate commerce was banned in the 1973 case of ''United States v. Orito''. The Supreme Court upheld zoning restrictions that either quarantine or disperse pornography merchants, leaving it to local officials to determine whether local interests are best served by restricting all porn merchants to a single district. Though the Court has also upheld zoning that prohibits pornographic entertainment within a certain distance of a school, the legitimate primary purpose excludes the preventing of access by minors which can be achieved much more directly by simple restrictions.;''The Place of Law'', ed. by Austin Sarat, Lawrence Douglas, Martha Merrill Umphrey. 2003, ISBN 0-472-11350-X; On May 13, 2002 writing for the majority in ''Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union'', Justice Clarence Thomas stated that using community standards to identify material that could be harmful to minors does not make the law overly broad and therefore unconstitutional under the First Amendment.;[http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=209 Research.Yale.edu ''Supreme Court Upholds Portions of Net Pornography Law'' posted by Raul Ruiz];

eUtah uses the legal term &quot;pornography&quot; for the same illegal sexually explicit material.;[http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/pornography/obscenpornlaws.htm AttorneyGeneral.Utah.gov Office of the Utah Attorney General Obscenity/Pornography Laws];
