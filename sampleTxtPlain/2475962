''Gray Lady Down'' is a 1978 disaster film by Universal Studios which starred Charlton Heston, David Carradine, Stacy Keach, Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, and featured the first film role for a young Christopher Reeve.

Plot
An aging, respected commander (Charlton Heston) is on his final submarine tour before his retirement. Returning to port, the submarine, USS ;Neptune; (possibly a Skate-class or Nautilus-class attack submarine), is struck by a Norwegian freighter and sinks to the ocean floor. A US Navy rescue force commanded by Stacy Keach arrives on scene, but ;Neptune; is perched on the edge of a precipice, at an angle that does not allow the Navy's Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) rescue submarine to complete its work.

A small experimental submersible, &quot;;Snark;,&quot; is brought in to assist with the rescue. ;Snark; is very capable, but run by a nonconformist navy misfit (David Carradine). The submersible is the only hope for a rescue and pulls off a miraculous rescue.

Ronny Cox plays Neptune's executive officer, scheduled to take over command from Charlton Heston, Ned Beatty plays the ;Snark;'s second crewman, and Christopher Reeve appears in his first film role in a bit part for the sharp-eyed viewer.

The movie re-used submarine special-effect footage from ''Ice Station Zebra'', with that film's submarine (''Tigerfish'') appearing as the USS ''Neptune''.

The movie is adapted from the novel ;Event 1000; by David Lavallee (1971).
