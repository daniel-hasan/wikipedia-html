DevilDriver is a death metal-influenced groove metal band from Santa Barbara, California. Coal Chamber vocalist Dez Fafara was not happy with the direction Coal Chamber was going in musically, and met musicians who had a similar music interest at a barbecue and bar. Fafara, guitarists Evan Pitts and Jeff Kendrick, bassist Jon Miller, and then-guitarist John Boecklin formed Deathride. Due to copyright issues and the name being taken by several bands, Deathride changed its name to DevilDriver, which refers to bells Italian witches used to drive evil forces away.

The band's self-titled album was not well received by some music critics. The primary writer of the album, Pitts, left the band and was replaced by Mike Spreitzer. Their second album, ''The Fury of Our Maker's Hand'' received a better reception with critics, and entered the Billboard 200 at number 117. The band embarked on several tours including Ozzfest and a Guinness world record was attempted at the 2007 Download Festival for the &quot;largest circle pit&quot;.

Biography
=Formation=
At the age of 15, bassist Jon Miller had formed a band with drummer John Boecklin and guitarist Jeff Kendrick in high school. The band was called Area-51 and played cover versions of Metallica, Slayer, Sepultura and Pantera.;; Miller, Boecklin and Kendrick met Coal Chamber vocalist Dez Fafara while he was in the process of recording the album ''Dark Days'' with Coal Chamber in 2002. The three were playing in a local band and talked to Fafara who said he was thinking about leaving Coal Chamber. Fafara said &quot;Hey you guys write some heavy shit, and I want to get out of Coal Chamber&quot;.;; Fafara hosted several barbecues after moving from Orange County to Santa Barbara and would jam with musicians he met, which lead to the formation of the band.;; Guitarist Evan Pitts met Fafara in a restaurant and gave him his phone number for a jam session, while John Boecklin who originally played guitar then played drums, met Fafara at a bar.;;

The band was originally known as Deathride, which was changed as Fafara felt there were too many bands with that name; a band in Norfolk, Virginia, and a bicycle racing team.;; Another problem was that the band's label, Roadrunner Records were unable to secure copyright.;; The members compiled a list of roughly two hundred names to go for a more original approach. Fafara's wife had a book by Italian witchcraft author Raven Grimassi on Stregheria, and came across the term 'devil driver'. The term 'devil driver' refers to bells Italian witches used to drive evil forces away. Fafara thought it was appropriate because it sounded &quot;evil&quot;, and thought the term &quot;suits his life&quot;.;; The band's logo is the Cross of Confusion, which has existed for thousands of years and refers to &quot;question religion, question authority, question everything around you&quot;. Fafara was brought up to &quot;question everything&quot; and was exposed to Italian witchcraft through his grandparents.;

DevilDriver's debut record was originally going to be called ''Thirteen'',;; and then ''Straight to Hell''. However, Fafara claims it was changed &quot;for so many reasons that I can't even go into&quot;.;; The band's self-titled debut ''DevilDriver'', was released on October 23, 2003 under Roadrunner Records, and entered the Top Heatseekers chart at number 117.; Guitarist Pitts wrote roughly 90% of the music, according to Mike Spreitzer, who replaced Pitts after his departure from the band.; Music critics response to the album was generally negative. ''All Music Guide'' reviewer Johnny Loftus commented that elements in the songs &quot;Die (And Die Now)&quot; and &quot;Swinging the Dead&quot; redeem an otherwise disappointing album and hoped the band would focus less on the mainstream.;;

=''The Fury of Our Maker's Hand'' (2005–2006)=
The band returned to the studio in 2005 to record their follow-up to ''DevilDriver''. The album was produced at Sonic Ranch Studios, apecan ranch,away from El Paso, Texas. The band members wanted to be isolated when recording the album so they could solely focus on the music as friends, family, managers and girlfriends would constantly interrupt. Roughly 30 songs were written which were narrowed down to 15 by the band. The 15 songs were then played for producer Colin Richardson who wanted to begin tracking immediately.

The name of the album was thought of by Fafara who believed that ''The Fury of Our Maker's Hand'' refers to the &quot;storm&quot; his life has been the past 10 years, &quot;You have your maker's hand and I have my maker's hand and we both living in our fury, the fury of our maker's hand. It explains my life&quot;.; The album was released on June 28, 2005 and debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number 117, with sales of 10,402 in its first week.;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=38915 &quot;Soundscan report DevilDriver&quot;] Blabbermouth.net, (July 6, 2005). Retrieved on November 11, 2007; The album also debuted at number 1 on the Top Heatseekers chart.;; Johnny Loftus of All Music Guide described the album as &quot;a severe turn away from the falter of their first album&quot; and said that the band made their &quot;true debut the second time around&quot;.;; Dom Lawson of ''Kerrang!'' gave the album a positive review describing the album as a &quot;fresh and exhilarating approach to modern metal&quot;.;;

The band toured extensively in support of the album, which included shows in the United States, Europe, and Australia in support of bands such as In Flames, Fear Factory, and Machine Head. The band played for the first time as a headliner in the Burning Daylight Tour. On October 31, 2006, ''The Fury of Our Maker's Hand'' was re-released to include three new studio tracks, including &quot;Digging up the Corpses&quot; which was featured on the soundtrack to ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''. The release also contained three live recordings of previously released, a DVD of all of the band's music videos, new cover art, and inside liner notes.;;

DevilDriver released their third studio effort titled ''The Last Kind Words'', which was released on June 16 in Australia, and June 19 in the United Kingdom. It was released on July 31 in the United States. The band reunited at Sonic Ranch Studios to isolate themselves to record the album. The album's first single &quot;Not All Who Wander Are Lost&quot; was directed by Nathan Cox for free. Cox's career began when he created Coal Chamber's music video &quot;Loco&quot;, so he re-paid a favor to the band. Cox now directs music videos for bands such as Linkin Park and Korn.; The first song to be previewed was &quot;Horn of Betrayal&quot; which debuted on Sirius Satellite's Hard Attack channel on May 16. ''The Last Kind Words'' entered the German charts at number 92,;; and peaked at number 48 on the Billboard 200,;; with over 14,000 copies sold.;;

A Guinness world record was attempted by the band for the &quot;largest circle pit&quot; at the festival. Guinness responded to the query and denied the request stating they receive over 60,000 requests a year and there is no way to physically define where a circle pit starts and ends. They considered the proposal fully in the context of the subject area and stated that &quot;our decision is final in this matter&quot;.;;;;

On July 28, 2007, the band announced on their MySpace that they would join the 2007 free Ozzfest on August 2, stating they would play the 3:30pm non-rotating slot in the afternoon. Fafara believed he was going to take the first six weeks off in 11 years until he received a call from John Fenton and Sharon Osbourne. Osbourne managed Fafara's previous band, Coal Chamber so he agreed to take a slot.;; DevilDriver was part of the Gigantour, which included Lacuna Coil, Static X and headliners Megadeth that toured through Australia in November 2007. Guitarist Spreitzer says the band is planning to release a DVD next year, which will include a live show.;; DevilDriver's songs &quot;Devil's Son&quot; and &quot;Driving Down the Darkness&quot; were featured in the TV show ''Scrubs''.;;
