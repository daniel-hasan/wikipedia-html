USS ''L. Y. Spear'' (AS-36) was the lead ship of her class of submarine tenders, in service to the United States Navy from 1970 through 1996. She was named for Lawrence York Spear, a former Navy lieutenant who played an integral role in submarine design at Electric Boat Company before and during World War II.

''L. Y. Spear'' was laid down by General Dynamics Corp. at Quincy, Massachusetts on 5 May 1966; launched on 7 September 1967; sponsored by the wife of Vice Admiral Schade, Commander, Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet; and commissioned on 22 February 1970.

Designed primarily to service nuclear attack submarines, ''L. Y. Spear'' was assigned to Submarine Squadron 6 with Norfolk, Virginia as her home port. She had the capability to provide logistic and technical support for as many as 12 submarines and service four of them alongside simultaneously.
