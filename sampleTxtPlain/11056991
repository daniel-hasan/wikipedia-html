The ''Jurassic Park'' franchise is a series of books, films and video games centering on a disastrous attempt to create a theme park of cloned dinosaurs. It began in 1990 when Universal Studios bought the rights to the novel by Michael Crichton before it was even published. 

The book was very successful, as was the 1993 film adaptation which led to two sequels, although the last was not based on a novel as was the previous films. The software developers Ocean Software, BlueSky Software and Sega of America have had the rights to developing video games since the 1993 film, and numerous games have been produced. 

Currently a #Future|fourth feature film is in the works, but it has been lingering in development hell since a year after the third film. Many rumors have surrounded the project since it was first reported, many surrounding plot and script ideas, and new logos. 

Development

Michael Crichton originally conceived a screenplay around a pterodactyl being cloned from fossil DNA. After wrestling with this idea for a while, he came up with ''Jurassic Park''.;; Steven Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the TV series ''ER''. Before the book was published, Crichton put up a non-negotiable fee for $1.5 million as well as a substantial percentage of the gross. Warner Bros. and Tim Burton, Columbia Tristar and Richard Donner, and 20th Century Fox and Joe Dante bid for the rights,;DVD Production Notes; Universal further paid Crichton $500,000 to adapt his own novel,;; but Universal eventually acquired them in May 1990 for Spielberg.;DVD Production Notes; Universal desperately needed money to keep their company alive, and partially succeeded with ''Jurassic Park'', as it became a critical;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jurassic_park; and commercial;http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=jurassicpark.htm; success. 

After Jurassic Park was released to home video, Chrichton was pressured from many sources for a sequel novel. Chrichton declined all offers until Spielberg himself told him that he would direct the sequel, if one would ever occour. Production then began almost immediately. After the novel was published in 1995, ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' began production in September 1996.;;

Before the production of the second film, Joe Johnston approached Steven Spielberg about directing the project. While Spielberg wanted to direct the first sequel, he agreed that if there was ever a third film, Johnston could direct.;; Production began on August 30 2000,;;

Books


Michael Crichton began an idea for a techno-thriller novel in 1983, with the premise centering around a pterodactyl being cloned from fossil DNA.;http://www.michaelcrichton.com/books-jurassicpark.html; After working on this premise of many years, his idea evolved into a creation of a theme park of cloned dinosaurs, with the dinosaurs escaping, all from a young boy's point of view.;http://www.michaelcrichton.com/books-jurassicpark.html; After submitting ideas to a few of his colleagues, he kept receiving the same negative response. After reworking the novel into an adult level from many points of view, Crichton received positive response. The novel was first published in 1990, later becoming a bestseller and Michael Crichton's signature novel. A #Jurassic Park|film entered production before the novel was even published, and was also a box-office success.

A sequel novel began production after readers and Steven Spielberg himself pressured Michael Crichton for a sequel novel. Michael Crichton confirmed that his novel had elements taken from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel of the same name.;http://www.michaelcrichton.com/books-lostworld-history.html; The book was also an outstanding success, both with professional and mediocre critics. A film adaptation was released in 1997.

Current films
=Jurassic Park=

''Jurassic Park'' is a 1993 science fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. The film centers on the island of Isla Nublar, where scientists have created an amusement park of cloned dinosaurs. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) invites a group of scientists, played by Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern, to visit the park. Sabotage sets the dinosaurs on the loose, and technicians and visitors attempt to escape the island.

Development of the film began before the novel was even published, and Crichton was hired to contribute to a script that cut much of its story. Spielberg hired Stan Winston Studios' puppets and worked with Industrial Light and Magic to develop cutting-edge Computer-generated imagery|CGI to portray the dinosaurs. ''Jurassic Park'' was well received by critics, although they criticized the characterization. During its release, the film grossed $914 million, becoming the most successful film yet released, and it is currently the List of highest-grossing films|ninth-highest grossing feature film, significantly inspiring a new breed of films that primarily used CGI for special effects. The film was followed by ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' in 1997 and by ''Jurassic Park III'' in 2001, with ''#Future|Jurassic Park IV'' in development.

=The Lost World: Jurassic Park=

''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' is a 1997 science fiction film and sequel to ''Jurassic Park'' directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. After the success of the first film, fans and critics alike pressured Michael Crichton for a sequel novel. Having never done one before, Crichton originally declined, but when Steven Spielberg finally started pressuring Crichton, a sequel novel was announced. As soon as the novel was published, a film was in pre-production, with a target release date of mid-1997. The film was a commercial success, breaking many box-office records when released. The film had mixed reviews, similar to its predecessor in terms of characterization.

The film centers on the island of Isla Sorna, an auxiliary site for the main Jurassic Park island, where dinosaurs have taken over and live in the wild. Ian Malcolm leads a team to document the dinosaurs in their native habitat, while an InGen team attempts to capture them for a second Jurassic Park in San Diego.

=Jurassic Park III=

''Jurassic Park III'' is a 2001 science fiction film and sequel to ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park''. It is the first in the series not to be based on a book by Michael Crichton or directed by Steven Spielberg. Originally, a third Jurassic Park film was produced under the title ''Jurassic Park: Extinction'';''2001 DVD release, poster section under special features'';, with the script involving a killer disease that threatened to wipe out the dinosaurs on both islands. After numerous script changes, Universal decided to drop the idea in favor of the current plot, with the title ''Jurassic Park III''. Although the idea was dropped, it was to be reused for ''#Future|Jurassic Park IV'', but it instead involved a killer disease the dinosaurs created that threatened to wipe out humans.;http://www.movieweb.com/news/91/691.php; Another idea was proposed under the title ''Jurassic Park: Breakout''. It was never revealed what the plot was supposed to involve.

Joe Johnston had been interested in directing the sequel to ''Jurassic Park'' and approached friend Steven Spielberg about the project. While Spielberg wanted to direct the first sequel, he agreed that if there was ever a third film, Johnston could direct.;; Production began on August 30 2000;; with filming in California, Oahu, and Molokai.;; 
The film was a moderate success, and had mixed reviews from critics. Most were split on whether the third installment was better or worse than its predecessor. The film once again suffered reviews of little to no characterization. 

The setting takes place on Isla Sorna, the island from the second film, after a couple hires Dr. Alan Grant to help them find their son.

Future
= Jurassic Park IV=


In June 2002, director Steven Spielberg told ''Starlog'' magazine that he planned to produce ''Jurassic Park IV'', and director Joe Johnston, who helmed ''Jurassic Park III'', would direct it.;; In November 2002, screenwriter William Monahan was hired to write,;; with the film's release slated for summer 2005.;; In July 2003, Monahan completed the first draft, with the story no longer set in the jungle.;; Actor Sam Neill said he was returning as List of characters in Jurassic Park#Dr. Alan Grant|Dr. Alan Grant, with filming expected to begin in 2004 in California and Hawaii.;; In September 2004, screenwriter John Sayles was re-writing the script, with the film re-slated for a winter 2005 release.;; His second draft focused on the new character Nick Harris, who returns to Isla Nublar, the location of the first film, and retrieves Dennis Nedry's can of DNA. He is captured by the Grendel corporation, which now owns InGen, and he is hired to train five genetically modified ''Deinonychus'' as mercenaries.;;

In October 2004, paleontologist Jack Horner said he would return as technical adviser for the fourth film as he had done for previous ''Jurassic Park'' films.;; By April 2005, special effects artist Stan Winston explained that the delay in production was due to repeated revisions of the film's script, none of which satisfied Spielberg. According to Winston, &quot;He felt neither of [the drafts] balanced the science and adventure elements effectively. It's a tough compromise to reach, as too much science will make the movie too talky, but too much adventure will make it seem hollow.&quot;;*; In February 2006, producer Frank Marshall said filming would begin in 2007 for a 2008 release.;; In March 2007, Sam Neill said he was not asked to reprise his role as Dr. Alan Grant,;; while Laura Dern was asked to return for the new film, which Universal still wanted to release by 2008.;;Director Joe Johnston was also reported not to be directing the film.;; Richard Attenborough has been contacted about reprising the role of John Hammond.;; The film was delayed to 2009, because of the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike.;;

Video games


Ever since the announcement of the 1993 ''Jurassic Park'' feature film, developers Ocean Software, BlueSky Software and Sega of America were licensed to produce games to be sold to coincide with the release of the film on the popular platforms of the time.

Ocean Software released video games based on the 1993 film for NES, Super NES, Game Boy, PC:DOS, and Amiga. Sega of America released three games for Sega systems. Each game became substantial sellers, and spawned a second generation of video games for SNES and Game Boy. For the second film in the franchise, DreamWorks Interactive released 5 games for the most popular systems at the time. The third film had the biggest marketing push, spawning seven video games for PC and Game Boy Advance. A number of arcade games were also released for all three films.
