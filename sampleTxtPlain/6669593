History
Prior to 1980 the California Department of Forestry (now known as CAL-Fire) operated the Orange County Fire Department under contract. In 1980 then California Governor Jerry Brown cancelled theCalifornia Department of Forestry contract with the Orange County Fire Department against the wishes of Orange County. As a result, Orange County operated the Orange County Fire Department (OCFD) beginning May 16, 1980.Due to the incorporations of new cities and additional cities contracting with the County Fire Department, in 1991 the OCFD began exploring the possibility of reorganizing as a separate agency - first as a Special District and then as a Joint Powers Authority.The County filed for bankruptcy in 1994, which further encouraged Orange County Fire Department to reorganize as a JPA, known as the Orange County Fire Authority.
