A Christmas tree farmer in the U.S. state of Florida explains the pruning and shearing process of cultivation to a government employee.
Christmas tree cultivation is an agricultural, forestry, and horticultural occupation which involves growing pine, spruce, and fir trees specifically for use as Christmas trees. The first Christmas tree farm was established in 1901, but most consumers continued to obtain their trees from forests until the 1930s and 1940s. Christmas tree farming was once seen only as a viable alternative for low-quality farmland, but that perception has changed within the agriculture industry. For optimum yield and quality, land should be flat or gently rolling and relatively free of debris and undergrowth.

A wide variety of pine and fir species are grown as Christmas trees, although a handful of varieties stand out in popularity. In the United States, Douglas-fir, Scots Pine and Fraser Fir all sell well. Nordmann Fir and Norway Spruce sell well in the United Kingdom, the latter being popular throughout Europe. Like all conifers, Christmas trees are vulnerable to a range of pests. Aphids and adelgids are the most common problems among insect pests, and sudden oak death is a recent development in Californian tree farms. Christmas tree farming has also raised criticism from environmentalists due to the use of pesticides and the possible effects of farming on biodiversity.

The final stage of cultivation, harvesting, is carried out in a number of ways; one of the more popular methods is the pick-your-own tree farm, where customers are allowed to roam the farm, select their tree, and cut it down themselves. Other farmers cultivate potted trees, with balled roots, which can be replanted after Christmas and used again the following year. In the United States, research into Christmas tree genetics has produced better strains of tree seed, which has resulted in higher yields of quality Christmas trees. Jurisdictions in Canada and the United States have established quality grades for cut Christmas trees.

History

The practice of cultivating evergreens specifically to sell as Christmas trees dates back to 1901, when a 25,000&amp;nbsp;tree Norway Spruce farm was sown near Trenton, New Jersey.;Faber Harold. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30610FF3D5C0C718CDDAB0994D8494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fC%2fChristmas Off to the farm for a Christmas tree], ([http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=115682875&amp;sid=2&amp;Fmt=2&amp;clientId=8829&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP ProQuest]), ''The New York Times'', December 2 1990, p. 17. Retrieved September 5 2007.; The commercial market for Christmas trees had started fifty years earlier when a farmer from the Catskill Mountains brought trees into New York City to sell.;Summers, Will. [http://www.qualityinfo.org/olmisj/ArticleReader?itemid=00004645 From Seed to Santa – A Tale of a Christmas Tree], ''Oregon Employment Department'', November 28 2005.; Despite these pioneering efforts, most people still obtained wild-grown Christmas trees from forests into the 1930s and 1940s.; More trees were grown in plantations after World War II, and by the 1950s farmers were shearing and pruning trees to meet customer demands. The Christmas tree market burgeoned through the 1960s and 1970s, but from the late 1980s onward prices and the market for natural Christmas trees declined. In the early 21st century nearly 98&amp;nbsp;percent of all natural (non-artificial) Christmas trees sold worldwide were grown on tree farms.;

Cultivation
=Land and climate=
This Christmas tree farm in southern Virginia is situated in a gently rolling valley.
Christmas tree farms are best located on relatively level land which is free of obstructions. In the past, Christmas tree farmers established their plantations on less desirable agricultural plots or &quot;wastelands of agriculture&quot;.; However, emphasis in modern Christmas tree farming has shifted toward the production of higher-quality trees, increasing land quality expectations as well.; Indeed, some species of tree, such as the Fraser Fir, are unable to grow on low-quality, marginal farmland.;Leuty, Todd. [http://www.omaf.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/info_fir.htm Fraser Fir for Christmas Trees and Landscape Transplants], ''Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs'' (Ontario), May 1 2005. Retrieved September 6 2007.; Flat or gently rolling land is preferred to that with steep slopes and inclines, which is prone to erosion and fluctuations in fertility. Noticeable obstructions, such as rocks, fences or significant underbrush, are also undesirable.;Brown, et al., Bulletin 670: Choice of Lands for Christmas Trees.;
This Christmas tree farm in Iowa is located on flat ground and has well-mowed rows between the trees.
Like all crops and plants, Christmas trees require a specific set of nutrients to thrive.; There are 16&amp;nbsp;elements crucial for growth; of those, three are obtained through air and water: hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, chlorine, manganese, molybdenum, iron, and zinc are obtained from the soil. If the necessary elements are not available in the local soil, nutritious fertilizers are used.;Hart, et al., ''Christmas Tree Nutrient Management Guide for Western Oregon and Washington''.; Other important soil considerations include pH and drainage.;Johnson, et al., ''Tree Crops for Marginal Farmland: Christmas Trees With a Financial Analysis''.; Certain types of soil are preferable, depending on the type of tree. Pine trees are usually better adapted to a sandy or sandy loam soil,; while White Spruce trees and fir trees, such as the Douglas-fir, prefer fine-texture loams and clay loam soils.; Some trees grow well in all types of soil, but in any case, the land must be well-drained for a Christmas tree farm to have a chance of thriving.;Koelling and Dornbush, ''Growing Christmas Trees in Michigan''.;

The weather, as with other agricultural endeavors, plays a key outcome in the yield of a Christmas tree farm. Severe cold in the winter and extreme hot and dry conditions during and after harvest can cause irreparable damage to the crop.; Early snow can make both harvesting and shipping trees difficult or impossible.;Barney and Finnerty, ''Christmas trees is this the crop for you?''.;

=Labor and equipment=
Christmas tree farming is a labor-intensive process. Depending on the quality of the land, bulldozing may need to be undertaken prior to planting, in order to remove obstacles such as large trees or rocks.;Brown, et al., Bulletin 670: ''Plantation Establishment and Management: Preplanting Land Preparation''.; If the volume of undergrowth requires it, the soil may be tilled; tilling can help remove any debris remaining after tree or weed removal. Both woody plants and herbaceous weeds must be controlled prior to planting; this is most often done by application of a chemical herbicide.; In addition, some types of fertilizers must be introduced into the soil prior to planting.; The work done prior to planting tree seedlings plays an important role in the overall success of a Christmas tree crop.;

After the trees are in the ground, work on the crop continues. Animal pests (especially insects) and diseases must be monitored and controlled, and weed growth must also be minimized. Many species of pine and fir require pruning and shearing two to four years after planting to maintain the trademark Christmas tree shape.; Late or omitted pruning can result in trees that are unmarketable due to large gaps in needle coverage. Some species of pine, such as the Scots Pine, are susceptible to dormant season &quot;yellowing&quot;, which is generally countered with a green dye or paint.;;Lane, Pirjetta, et al. [http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1499.pdf Christmas tree production in Iowa], (PDF file), Cooperative Extension Service, ''Iowa State University'', December 1992. Retrieved September 6 2007.;

The outlay of money on equipment varies greatly. Some items commonly found on Christmas tree farms are insecticide sprayers, tractors, and shaper sheers.;Preston, For a Very Merry Christmas, Invest in Trees for the Season. ''International Herald Tribune''.; Mechanized planters, at a cost of about US$4,000, are not essential but a work-saving luxury for farmers.; Farmers can purchase seedlings, the lifeblood of a Christmas tree farm, from nurseries. One farmer in Oregon purchased seedlings for between US$200–300 per 1,000&amp;nbsp;plants. The farmer, a wholesaler, sold his final products for about $20&amp;nbsp;each; after the cost of the trees and other expenses, a profit of $2–3&amp;nbsp;per tree.;

Norway Spruce is a popular Christmas tree species in Europe.
In Great Britain, Nordmann Fir is a popular species, largely due to its needle-holding qualities.;Anonymous, ''Metro'' (London), ''Tree shortage threatens Christmas''.;;''BBC'', ''Gardening''.; Other popular trees in Britain are Norway Spruce, Serbian Spruce, and Scots Pine, the last of which is slightly rarer;; it has sharp needles which do not shed easily.;

In the U.S. Pacific Northwest, a major Christmas tree growing region, Douglas-fir has always been the primary species grown.; A full one-half of all trees produced in the Pacific Northwest are Douglas-fir.;Bondi, ''An Introduction to Growing Christmas Trees''.; Douglas-firs typically take five to seven years before they are mature enough to sell as Christmas trees.; Also common in the region are Noble Fir, a tree which commands a higher price than Douglas-fir, and Grand Fir, which accounts for about 10&amp;nbsp;percent of the annual harvest in the Northwest.; Other species collectively account for only 3–5&amp;nbsp;percent of the total Northwest harvest.;

In North America, Fraser Fir, grown in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, has been called the &quot;Cadillac of Christmas Trees&quot; as well as the &quot;most popular and most valuable of Christmas tree species&quot;.;Vukina, Tomislav, et al. (2001).

Christmas tree quality grades have been in place since 1965&amp;nbsp;in Ontario, Canada, and were included under the provincial Farm Products Grades and Sales Act.;Leuty, ''Christmas tree production''.; While the grades in Ontario are law, in the United States the grading system is not mandated. In fact, it is common for U.S. growers to develop their own grading systems.;Brown, James H., et al.

=Harvest=
Customers, armed with a saw, at a typical &quot;choose-and-cut&quot; Christmas tree farm

Christmas trees can be harvested and marketed in different ways. Some operations are known as &quot;choose-and-cut&quot; or pick-your-own farms, which allow customers to walk through the planted land, select their Christmas tree and cut down themselves.; Wholesale operations are more labor-intensive because they usually require the farmer to complete tasks such as baling, cutting, moving the trees to a roadside pick-up, and loading the harvest. In addition, this work must be completed during a very short period in November.; Growers also harvest trees by digging and balling the root and selling the trees as nursery stock or as live, reusable Christmas trees. This last option allows trees to be harvested earlier than the usual six to ten year period required to grow a mature Christmas tree.;

Larger farms began using helicopters to move tree harvests during the 1980s.;Chastagner and Benson, ''The Christmas Tree: Traditions, Production and Diseases''.; One 1200&amp;nbsp;acre (500&amp;nbsp;ha) farm in Oregon lacked road access, so it began using helicopters to move up to 200,000&amp;nbsp;Christmas trees per year.; Helicopters decrease the amount of time between harvesting and market, cutting it from up to two weeks down to as little as three days.;Kalkstein, ''KVAL News Channel 13'' (Eugene, Oregon), &quot;Christmas tree harvest&quot;.;

Environmental effect
Christmas tree farming affects the surrounding environment in a number of ways, and groups differ as to which effect to protest. In the United States, the National Christmas Tree Association (NCTA) touts the environmental benefits of live Christmas trees, especially over the competing artificial alternative.; The NCTA stated that every acre of Christmas trees in production produced the daily oxygen requirement for 18&amp;nbsp;people; with 500,000&amp;nbsp;acres (2,000&amp;nbsp;km²) in production in the U.S. alone, that amounts to oxygen for 9&amp;nbsp;million people per day.; The NCTA also stated that the farms help to stabilize the soil, protect water supplies and provide wildlife habitat.;''National Christmas Tree Association'', &quot;Real Christmas Trees are a Benefit to the Environment&quot;.; In addition, the industry points to the reduction of carbon dioxide through Christmas tree farming.;Hickman, &quot;Is it OK . . . to get a Christmas tree?&quot;;

A 1998 report from the Michigan State University Agricultural Experiment Station predicted increasing environmental concerns about tree production and use as one possible reason people may favor artificial trees in the future. The report cited the use of fertilizers and pesticides and increasing concerns regarding tree disposal as the chief elements in its prediction.;Koelling, Melvin R., et al.
