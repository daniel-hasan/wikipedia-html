''Love. Angel. Music. Baby.'' is the debut solo album by American pop rock singer Gwen Stefani, released by Interscope Records in November 2004 (see 2004 in music). The album originally began as a small side project for the No Doubt frontwoman, but grew into a large production with numerous collaborations and producers.

The album was designed as an updated version of an 1980s music record, and was influenced by artists such as Madonna, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, and Club Nouveau. Most of the songs on the record focus on fashion and wealth. The album introduced the &quot;Harajuku Girls&quot;, four backup dancers who dress in Stefani's interpretation of the youth fashion trends of Harajuku, a district in Tokyo.

Despite gathering mostly positive reviews, ''L.A.M.B.'' received criticism for its many collaborations and superficial lyrical content. The album yielded six singles and had high sales, going multi-platinum in several countries, and selling seven million copies. It earned Stefani several Grammy Award nominations in 2005 and 2006.

Conception and production
During Stefani's time with No Doubt, she began making solo appearances on albums by artists including Eve, Moby, and Prince. In the production of its 2001 album ''Rock Steady'', No Doubt collaborated with Prince, The Neptunes, and David A. Stewart on different songs and had Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent mix the album. While the band was on tour to promote the album, Stefani listened to Club Nouveau's 1987 single &quot;Why You Treat Me So Bad&quot; and considered recording material that modernized 1980s music.;Vineyard, Jennifer.

When the two began working on a song that Stefani stated was too personal, she left to visit Kanal. He played her a track on which he had been working and which became &quot;Crash&quot;, another single from the album. The two tried to write new material, but gave up after two weeks. They did not return to work until six months later, when Stefani began collaborating with other artists, commenting, &quot;If I were to write the chorus of 'Yesterday' by the Beatles, and that's all I wrote, that would be good enough to be part of that history.&quot;Stefani resumed work with Linda Perry, who invited Dallas Austin, and many other artists, including OutKast's André 3000, The Neptunes, and Dr. Dre.; Stefani announced the album's release in early 2004,;Orshoski, Wes.
