Overview

Suema Kazuko and Kirima Nagi (back) and Boogiepop, the protagonists of the series, along with Taniguchi Masaki (front)
To face the &quot;enemies of the world&quot;, the ''shinigami'' Boogiepop automatically rises to the surface.In Boogiepop's world, the Towa Organization, a shadowy group seeking to control humanity, managed to capture an alien organism who had taken the form of a highly-evolved human.By studying him, the Towa Organization was able to create synthetic humans, people who have been artificially enhanced with special abilities.The mission of the Towa Organization and its agents is to find and kill MPLS, people who are more evolved than others and possess special abilities. However, Boogiepop will not let the Towa Organization get its way and he is not alone in his efforts.

The Boogiepop series is very much about the characters: their relationships, their pasts, their memories.This is especially true for how their pasts moulded them into the people they are today.It can also be seen through scenes being presented from the perspective of different characters, and how the individual casts a different &quot;feel&quot; by how they relate to events.;DVD commentary featuring Jeff Thompson and Joe DiGiorgi (August 2001) ''Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 1'';Another important theme is change.How the world changes and our different perceptions of this change, especially how one's perception of things changes as they grow up.;DVD commentary featuring Jeff Thompson, Crispin Freeman, and Rachel Lillie (2001) ''Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 2'';''Boogiepop Phantom'' is also highly metaphorical, with a character or an image representing much more than face value.;DVD commentary featuring Jeff Thompson and Angora Deb (2002) ''Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 4'';It is also &quot;a show about the inter-related nature of people's lives and the concept that they know of as time.&quot;;;

Kadono has published fourteen light novels and has serialised short stories in ''Dengegi HP'',;; many of which have been published as a four-volume series about Pete Beat, a member of the Towa Organisation.Two manga serials have been drawn for this series, which were serialized in ''Dengeki Daiou'';; and ''Dengeki Animation''.; In 2000, the anime series ''Boogiepop Phantom'' aired on Japanese television; a drama CD, featuring Kaori Shimizu, was released to promote this series.; Later that year, the movie ''Boogiepop and Others'' was released.;

Characters

Each Boogiepop title has its own cast of characters, and many of these characters will make appearances in more than one title, but there are only four central characters that are consistently at the center of the plot.

The shinigami whispered of among the female students of Shinyo Academy, few people know that Boogiepop actually exists.Normally dormant, Boogiepop rises to the surface when enemies of the world appear.Boogiepop's appearance and voice are ambiguous: they seem both masculine and feminine at the same time.However, hidden beneath his signature black cloak and black, pipe-shaped hat, little is ever seen of him.Straight-faced and to the point, Boogiepop acts as mechanical as he claims to be.Boogiepop speaks in an archaic manner, and seems fond of whistling the overture to Wagner's ''Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg''.

Reception

''Boogiepop and Others'' won the Fourth Dengeki Novel Prize in 1997 and was released in the Dengeki Book Collection in 1998 where it gained popularity.;History of Boogiepop (2005-03-01) ''Boogiepop and Others'';It is credited with popularizing light novels,; as well as redefining young adult fiction in Japan.;; It was later adapted into a live action film by Ryu Kaneda, a two-volume manga by Kouji Ogata and served as the inspiration for a soundtrack composed by Yuki Kajiura.;''Boogiepop and Others'' also sets the scene for the anime, ''Boogiepop Phantom'', which has its backstory loosely based on the climax of the light novel.Having already gained a strong readership among High School and University age men, the release of ''Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1'' was met with overwhelming support.By the time the ''Boogiepop and Others'' film was released, the Boogiepop series was a bestseller, with over 2 million copies in print.;

=Reviews=
The Boogiepop series has received high praise from critics.''Boogiepop Phantom'' has received the most exposure, where it is often compared to ''Serial Experiments Lain'' and ''Paranoia Agent''.;;It has been noted that the series is &quot;not your average anime&quot;, and one that &quot;demands your attention&quot;.;;While the fine detail the animators went into with the visuals has received much praise, bland character designs have been noted as one of the series' flaws, though &quot;astute viewers may notice some rather interesting [...] differences between the various characters.&quot;;;The soundtrack has received much acclaim, not only for the background music and voice actor performances, but also the detail that went into the sound effects.;;The presentation of the storyline was well received, but it was acknowledged that not everyone would be interested in following the subtle clues in each episode.;;A common complaint, however, is that there are many loose ends, mainly relating to the back-story,;; leaving the series &quot;with more questions than answers&quot;.;

Far less critiqued, the ''Boogiepop and Others'' film fares less well than its sequel.Whilst the characters and plot were well received, the special effects and costumes have been described as &quot;campy&quot;, but &quot;par for the course of something of this level and budget&quot;.;;The movie is, however, cited as being easier to watch, and is recommended to fans of the anime, so as to gain &quot;a complete understanding of the Boogiepop events&quot;.;;

The ''Boogiepop and Others'' novel has received more favorable reviews, though these have mostly focused on the translation, which has been cited as &quot;a standard against which future Japanese novel translations are judged&quot;.;;It has also received praise for ripping &quot;the rules of narrative wide open&quot;,;; especially for how it allows the characters to grow on the reader.;;''Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1'' continues receiving positive feedback for its easy-to-read style and excellent translation, as well as its use of atmosphere and characters.The main flaw, however, is the briefness of the title, which has clearly been used to set-up the sequel.;

''Boogiepop Doesn't Laugh'' has received generally favourable reviews, particularly for capturing some of the more complicated scenes better than the original light novel.This makes the plot easier to follow, and captures the urgency of the climactic battle.;;However, it has been noted that breaking the complicated plot of ''Boogiepop and Others'' into a multi-volume manga results in individually weak volumes.;;As with ''Boogiepop Phantom'', the character designs have been noted as &quot;lookalike and nondescript&quot;, which can make some of the events difficult to follow.The art has also been described as &quot;washed out and dull&quot;.;
