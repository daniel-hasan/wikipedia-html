''Fundamental'' is the sixteenth album, the ninth of entirely new music, by the British band Pet Shop Boys. It was released in May 2006 in the United Kingdom, Europe, Japan, and Canada, and was released in late June 2006 in the United States. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number five on 28 May 2006 (see 2006 in British music).

The album was produced by the Pet Shop Boys and Trevor Horn and it features eleven new Pet Shop Boys compositions, and &quot;Numb,&quot; written by Diane Warren (Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe originally planned to have &quot;Numb&quot; be one of two new tracks on ''Pop Art: Pet Shop Boys - The Hits|PopArt'', but opted instead for &quot;Miracles&quot; and &quot;Flamboyant&quot;).

The liner notes shows that the album is dedicated to two executed Iranian teenagers, Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni, who were hanged on July 19, 2005.Some reports have suggested the two may have been executed for engaging in homosexual behavior, though others indicate they were hanged for raping a 13 year-old boy.

Overview
=Subject matter=
The album has been noted for being more political than any other of the duo's albums to date; even the title, in one sense, is a reference to religious fundamentalism &amp;mdash; portrayed here in a light, critical manner, which singer Neil Tennant attributes to the relatively relaxed status of religious freedom in the United Kingdom.;;

Specific contemporary issues discussed in the lyrics include tensions and fears in the United States caused by the War on Terrorism, addressed in songs such as &quot;Psychological&quot; and &quot;Luna Park&quot;.;; (&quot;Luna Park&quot; being the name of various amusement parks around the world; see Luna Park for a list of such places). Other songs refer to the politics of the band's home country; &quot;Indefinite leave to remain&quot; refers to an immigration status in the United Kingdom, while &quot;Integral&quot; criticizes the British national identity card plans. (A statement from a band spokesman cites the issue as the reason that Tennant ceased his well-publicized support of Tony Blair's Labour Party.) The lyrics are fully masked and converted to the homage to Yevgeny Zamyatin's legendary dystopian book &quot;We&quot;, in which the inhabitants of the future One State try to build The Integral in order to solve the cosmic equation and resolve all the problems in their One State. &quot;I'm with Stupid&quot;, meanwhile, touches upon both countries by satirizing Blair's Tony Blair#Special relationship with the United States of America|alliance with George W. Bush. (See also special relationship.);;

Other subject matters are dealt with as well. &quot;Casanova in Hell&quot; is about the 18th century historical figure Giacomo Casanova, and how he immortalized himself by writing memoirs about his history of sexual seduction of numerous women. Tennant refers to, specifically, the book ''Casanova's Homecoming'' by Arthur Schnitzler as his inspiration for the song.; (It was sung by Rufus Wainwright at its very first live performance, at a private concert recorded for BBC Radio 2 at the Mermaid Theatre on May 8, 2006.);; &quot;The Sodom and Gomorrah Show&quot; references two of the biblical cities of sin, Sodom and Gomorrah, in saying that to learn to 'go where angels fear to tread' (ie. to sin) is to learn to live freely.

=Music=
The album is Pet Shop Boys' first collaboration with Trevor Horn since the 1988 single &quot;Left to My Own Devices&quot;. Its sound bears the producer's heavily orchestral style (also present on that song), most frequently associated with the 1982 ABC album ''The Lexicon of Love'' as well as the 1984 Frankie Goes to Hollywood single &quot;Two Tribes&quot; and subsequent album ''Welcome to the Pleasuredome''. Horn was also musical director for the Radio 2 concert, which featured the BBC Concert Orchestra.;

The album's personnel included many of Horn's frequent musical collaborators, including Anne Dudley, Tessa Niles, Jamie Muhoberac, Phil Palmer, Steve Lipson, Lalo Creme, Tim Pierce, Earl Harvin, Frank Ricotti, Luis Jardim, Lucinda Barry.;;

=''Fundamentalism''=
&quot;In Private&quot;, here presented as a duet with Elton John, was originally a Dusty Springfield song written and produced by the Pet Shop Boys. First released as a single in 1989, it was later included on the 1991 album ''Reputation''.

=''Fundamental'' (original track listing)=
On December 22 2005, the official Pet Shop Boys website announced an early track listing for the album and gave a release date of April 17 2006 with new single &quot;Minimal&quot; arriving a few weeks beforehand. This was quickly followed up on December 23, when pop music fansite Popjustice gave the first review of the album [http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=146&amp;Itemid=138]. The original proposed tracklisting was:

On February 13 2006, it was announced that the release date of ''Fundamental'' had been pushed back to May 22, because EMI needed &quot;more set-up time&quot;. At the same time &quot;I'm with Stupid&quot; was announced to be the revised lead single. This was followed on April 4 2006, with news that there would be a limited edition of the new album that would include a bonus CD called ''Fundamentalism''.
