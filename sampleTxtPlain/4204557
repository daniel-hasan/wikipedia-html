This discography lists the key British and notable international releases of The KLF and the other pseudonyms of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty. It also details the other releases on their independent record label, KLF Communications, by KLF-spinoff Disco 2000 and Space (a Cauty solo work). In the United Kingdom—their home country—Drummond and Cauty released six albums and a wide array of 12&amp;nbsp;&quot; singles on KLF Communications;. In other territories their material was typically issued under licence by local labels.

Although the duo's early works as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs) aroused media interest, with many singles being awarded &quot;single of the week&quot; by various music publications,;See the Library of Mu: [http://search.atomz.com/search/?sp-a=sp1003324b&amp;sp-f=ISO-8859-1&amp;sp-q=%22single+of+the%22&amp;sp-p=all list of &quot;singles of the week&quot;]. Retrieved 31 May 2006.; Drummond and Cauty neither sought nor found mainstream chart success until the release of The Timelords' million-selling DIY release &quot;Doctorin' the Tardis&quot; in May 1988.;;; The KLF's single &quot;Kylie Said to Jason&quot;, from ''The White Room'' soundtrack, was designed for chart success, but failed to reach the UK Top 100.;;However, The KLF achieved international chart success with the string of pop-house singles that began with &quot;What Time Is Love?|What Time Is Love? (Live at Trancentral)&quot;, and they became the internationally highest-selling singles band of 1991.;;;;

Note that this is a not a ''complete'' list; compilation appearances of otherwise available tracks, bootleg recordings, and certain very limited edition remix and promotional singles have been excluded.;The KLF's complete discography is complex, and it contains many variants and obscure items of interest only to collectors. Limited edition and white label remix singles bearing the same basic catalogue numbers and no new ''songs'' (such as KLF 004Y, the Moody Boys and Echo &amp; The Bunnymen remixes of &quot;What Time Is Love?|What Time Is Love? (Live At Trancentral)&quot;); bootlegs; and overseas releases which offer no additional material to the definitive KLF Communications UK catalogue are all outside the scope of this article.

Readers interested in collecting KLF Communications releases should refer to [http://www.klf.de/discography/ Lazlo's KLF discography] which is the main source from which this article has been compiled.;

Unreleased
The following KLF projects were announced but not released. Some of these, but by no means all, circulate as bootleg recordings/videos; some may not have been recorded at all.;The following unreleased singles are not listed: &quot;Make It Rain&quot; and &quot;No More Tears&quot;, which feature on ''The White Room''. &quot;Go To Sleep&quot; was never scheduled, and featured on the scrapped ''White Room'' album. The &quot;Club Mix&quot; of &quot;Madrugada Eterna&quot; was released on a very limited edition white label; alternate mixes were released on ''Chill Out'' and &quot;Kylie Said to Jason&quot;. The club mix of &quot;It's Grim Up North&quot; (promo only). The ''Pure Trance'' LP is excluded because of insufficient sources; it was likely either disc 2 of ''Shag Times'' (sometimes called ''Towards the Trance'') or a compilation of the not-completed &quot;Pure Trance&quot; series of singles.;
