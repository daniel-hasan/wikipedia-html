''Another Perfect Day'' is the seventh album by the British heavy metal band Motörhead. The album was released in 1983 and reached number 20 in the UK charts.

After guitarist &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke left Motörhead on their second US tour, Brian &quot;Robbo&quot; Robertson (ex-Thin Lizzy) was drafted to complete the tour. On their return to the UK the band recorded their unique and controversial album - ''Another Perfect Day''.

Although it is the most melodic and unique album Motörhead had ever recorded, the fans were not pleased; Robertson and Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor went to form the band ''Operator'' and Lemmy went on with Motörhead, forming the new line-up of Lemmy, Phil Campbell, Würzel, Pete Gill.

The original vinyl release has a lyric-sheet insert, with a cartoon storyboard of the adventures of the new band, as it were.

In 1988 Castle Communications re-issued this albumalong with ''Overkill'' – in a gatefold sleeve.

The thrash metal band Sepultura named themselves after the third track from this album, &quot;Dancing on Your Grave&quot;.;Max Cavalera tells how this came to be after translating the lyrics to the &quot;Dancing on Your Grave&quot; on the video ''Third World Chaos''.;

Sleeve artwork
Joe Petagno, the sleeve artist, commented that the cover was borne of upheaval prevalent in the band and its members at the time:
;I didn't hear the music. I think I got a rough mix. It was different. But, I did it on a beer box, with a drawing board on my lap and some paints and a bucket of water by my side. And the reason it turned out the way it was – it was all chaos. Chaos in my life, and chaos in Lemmy's life. I brought it to London with me to deliver it personally to the guys and everyone was freaked over it. They'd never seen anything like it. And I remember Philthy said, &quot;Fuck man! If the kids see that on acid, they're just going to freak!&quot; It's one of my favourite sleeves.;''About Joe Petagno'' - interview section with Joe Petagno, bonus DVD with ''Inferno (album)#30th Anniversary DVD content|Inferno 30th Anniversary edition'' SPV69748.;;
