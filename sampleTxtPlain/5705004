Janice Moodie(31 May 1973 in Glasgow) is a Scottish golfer who plays mainly on the U.S.-based LPGA Tour but is also a member of the Ladies European Tour.

Amateur career

At age 11,Moodie was taught to play golf by her mother, a former 6-handicap amateur, at Windyhills Golf Club in Bearsden, Scotland.; 
; At age 16, she left school and started working in a grocery store and a sporting-goods shop.She had to postpone her college enrollment when her mother suffered a brain aneurysm that left her with tunnel-vision blindness and for the next three and a half years Moodie worked in the winter (including a few weeks in a nightclub) so she could play competitive amateur golf in the summer.; 
; During this period she won the 1992 Scottish Women's Strokeplay Championship; 
; and represented Great Britain and Ireland in the Curtis Cup in 1994 when her win over Carol Semple Thompson in the final singles match secured a 9- 9 tie keeping the Curtis Cup in GB&amp;I by virtue of the GB&amp;I win in 1992.; 
; She also played on the victorious 1996 team in Killarney, Ireland ; 
;; 

; and played in the 1996 Espirito Santo Trophy World Amateur Team Championship where she finished 2nd.; 
; ; 
; 

Moodie enrolled at San Jose State University to play collegiate golf for the Spartans, graduating in 1997 with a degree in psychology.; She won 12 collegiate tournaments including the 1995 GolfWorld/Palmetto Dunes,; 
; the 1996 Stanford Women's Intercollegiate and the 1997 Peg Barnard California Collegiate.; 
; She was Big WestChampion 1994-1996,; 
; Big West Athlete of the Year 1994-1996, was All-Big West 1994 and 1995 and finished in the top ten at the NCAA Championships each year 1994-1997 thus earning First-Team All-American honours each year during 1994-1997.; 
; She posted the lowest scoring average on her team from 1996-97 and won the Golfstat Cup in 1996.; 
; She turned professional in 1997 and qualified for the LPGA Tour by tying for 21st at the LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament to earn non-exempt status for the 1998 season.; 
;

;

In 2002, Moodie won her second LPGA title at the Asahi Ryokuken International Championship;

; Captain Catrin Nilsmark did pick Moodie for the 2003 Solheim Cup; 
; and she rewarded her captain by winning three and a half points and paved the way during the singles matches when she defeated Kelli Keuhne by 3&amp;2 in the top match.; 2003 also saw Moodie inducted into the San Jose State University Sports Hall of Fame.;

; and made it three appearance in a row when she paired with Mhairi McKay in the 2007 staging.;
