General Wesley Kanne Clark, GBE, MSC, (born December 23 1944) is a retired four-star general of the United States Army. Clark was valedictorian of his class at West Point, was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford where he obtained a degree in PPE (Philosophy, Politics &amp; Economics), and later graduated from the Command and General Staff College with a master's degree in military science. He spent 34 years in the Army and the Department of Defense, receiving many military decorations, several honorary knighthoods, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Clark commanded Operation Allied Force in the Kosovo War during his term as the Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO from 1997 to 2000. Some of Clark's command decisions during the conflict, such as his statements at press briefings and his actions at Priština International Airport, were heavily criticized. At times, he had a difficult relationship with Secretary of Defense William Cohen and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Hugh Shelton, which led to rumors Clark was forced into retirement, though both he and the Department of Defense said his retirement was merely standard personnel movement.

Clark joined the 2004 race for the Democratic Party presidential nomination as a candidate on September 17, 2003, but withdrew from the primary race on February 11, 2004 in favor of campaigning for the eventual Democratic nominee, John Kerry. Clark currently leads a political action committee — &quot;WesPAC: Securing America&quot; — which was formed after the primaries,;[http://www.securingamerica.com/ WesPAC — Securing America], [http://securingamerica.com/history WesPAC History].

Early life and education
Clark's paternal great-grandfather was a Belarusian Jew who immigrated to the United States in response to the Pale of Settlement and anti-Semitic violence from Russian pogroms. Clark's father, Benjamin J. Kanne, graduated from the Chicago-Kent College of Law and served in the U.S. Naval Reserve as an Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign during World War I, although he was never assigned to a combat mission. Kanne, living in Chicago, Illinois, became involved with ward politics in the 1920s as a prosecutor and served in local offices. He went on to serve as a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention that nominated Franklin D. Roosevelt as the party's presidential candidate;Felix, Antonia, ''Wesley Clark: A Biography''. Newmarket Press; New York, New York, 2004. pp. 7–9.; (though his name does not appear on the published roll of convention delegates;Official Report of the Proceedings of the Democratic National Convention, held at Chicago, Illinois, June 27th to July 2nd, inclusive, 1932;).

Kanne came from the Kohen family line,;Felix, pp. 12–13.; and Clark's son has characterized his grandparents' marriage, between Jewish Benjamin and Methodist Veneta Kanne,;[http://www.clark04.com/about/ Clark 2004 biography] by Clark For President.

Produced by Linda Burstyn, Cathee Weiss and Douglas Jackson; edited by Gregg Featherman.;

Clark was born Wesley Kanne in Chicago on December 23 1944. His father Benjamin died on December 6, 1948, following which his mother then moved the family to Little Rock, Arkansas. This move was made for a variety of reasons, including escaping the greater cost of living in a large city such as Chicago, the support Veneta's family in Arkansas could provide, and her feeling of being an outsider to the remaining Kanne family as she did not share their religion.;Felix, pp. 14–15.; Once in Little Rock, Veneta married Viktor Clark, whom she met while working as a secretary for a local bank.;Felix, p. 22.; Viktor raised Wesley as his son, and officially adopted him on Wesley's 16th birthday. Wesley's name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark. Viktor Clark's name actually replaced that of Wesley's biological father on his birth certificate, something Wesley would later say that he wished they had not done.;Felix, p. 25.; Veneta raised Wesley without telling him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti-Semitic activities of the Ku Klux Klan occurring in the South at the time.;Felix pp. 16–17.; Although his mother was Methodist, Clark chose a Baptist church after moving to Little Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood.;Felix, p. 21.;

He graduated from Hall High School with a National Merit Scholarship, and helped take their Swimming#Competitive swimming|swim team to the state championship, filling in for a sick teammate by swimming two legs of a relay.;;Felix, p. 41.;;Felix, p. 52.; Clark has often repeated the anecdote that he decided he wanted to go to West Point after meeting a Officer Cadet#United States|cadet with glasses who told Clark (who wore glasses as well) that one did not need perfect vision to attend West Point as Clark had thought.;;Felix, p. 49.; Clark applied, and received his acceptance letter on April 24 1962.

Military career
Clark's acceptance letter from West Point
Clark's military career began July 2 1962 when he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Clark later said an important influence on his view of the military came from Douglas MacArthur's famous wikisource:Duty, honor, country|&quot;Duty, honor, country&quot; speech given to the class of 1962, only months before Clark entered West Point. A recording of the speech was played for Clark's class when they first arrived.;;Felix, pp. 54–68.;

Clark sat in the &quot;first chair&quot; in many of his classes, a position held by the highest performer in class. Clark participated heavily in debate, was consistently within the top 5% of his class as a whole (earning him a &quot;Distinguished Cadet&quot; patch on his uniform), and ultimately graduated as valedictorian of West Point. The valedictorian is first to choose which career field of the Army to serve in, and Clark selected armor. He met Gertrude Kingston, his future wife, at a USO dance for Midshipman#United States Navy|midshipmen and West Point cadets.;;

Clark eventually applied for a Rhodes Scholarship and learned in December of his senior year at West Point that he had been accepted. He spent his summer at the United States Army Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia. Clark worked in the Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) program during his Rhodes Scholarship, completing his degree at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in August 1968. While he was at Oxford, a Jewish cousin of Clark's who lived in England telephoned Clark and informed him of his Jewish heritage (after asking his mother if she would allow it). Clark spent three months after graduation at Fort Knox, Kentucky, going through Armor Officer Basic Course, then went on to Ranger School at Fort Benning. He was promoted to captain and was assigned as commander of the A Company of the 4th Battalion, 68th Armor, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Riley, Kansas.;Felix, pp. 69–80.;

=Vietnam=
Clark's Silver Star citation
Clark was assigned a position in the 1st Infantry Division and flew to Vietnam on May 21 1969 during the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He worked as a staff officer, collecting data and helping in operations planning, and was awarded the Bronze Star for his work with the staff. Clark was then given command of A Company, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division in January 1970. In February, only one month into his command, he was shot four times by a Viet Cong soldier with an AK-47. The wounded Clark shouted orders to his men, who counterattacked and defeated the Viet Cong force. Clark had injuries to his right shoulder, right hand, right hip, and right leg, and was sent to Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania to recuperate. He was awarded the Silver Star for his actions during the encounter.;Felix, pp. 80–84.;

Clark had converted to Catholicism, his wife Gertrude's religion, while in Vietnam. He saw his son, Wesley Clark, Jr., for the first time while at the Valley Forge Hospital.;Felix, pp. 85–87.; Clark commanded C Company, 6th Battalion, 32nd Armor, 194th Armored Brigade, a company composed entirely of wounded soldiers, at Fort Knox. Clark has said this command is what made him decide to continue his military career past the four-year commitment required by West Point, which would have concluded in 1971. Clark completed his Armor Officer Advanced Course while at Fort Knox, taking additional elective courses and writing an article that won the Armor Association Writing Award. His next posting was to the office of the Army Chief of Staff in Washington, D.C., where he worked in the &quot;Modern Volunteer Army&quot; program from May to July 1971. He then served as a social studies instructor at West Point for three years from July 1971 to 1974.;Detailed resume included with his nomination before the Senate Armed Services Committee, First Session, 105th Congress. July 9 1997.;;Felix, pp. 88–95.;

Clark graduated from the Command and General Staff College (CGSC), earning his military Master of Arts degree in military science from the CGSC with a thesis on American policies of gradualism in the Vietnam War. Clark's theory was one of applying force swiftly, which was being advocated by many soldiers at the time, a concept that would eventually become established as U.S. national security policy in the form of the Weinberger Doctrine and its successor, the Powell Doctrine. Clark was promoted to major upon his graduation from the CGSC.;Felix, pp. 95–97.;

=Post-Vietnam=
In 1975, Clark was appointed a White House Fellow in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as a special assistant to its director, James Thomas Lynn. He was one of only 14 appointed out of 2,307 applicants.;&quot;White House Assigns Fellow to OMB Office,&quot; ''Arkansas Democrat-Gazette'', June 29 1975.; Lynn also gave Clark a six-week assignment to assist John Otho Marsh, Jr.|John Marsh, then a counselor to the President. Clark was approached during his fellowship to help push for a memorial to the Vietnam War. He worked with the movement that ultimately helped lead to the creation of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Clark took two commands with the 1st Armored Division based in Germany from August 1976 to February 1978, first over the 3rd Battalion 35th Armor and then the entire 3rd Brigade.; Clark's brigade commander while in the former position said Clark was &quot;singularly outstanding, notably superb.&quot; Regarding his term as brigade commander, one of his battalion commanders called Clark the &quot;most brilliant and gifted officer [he'd] ever known.&quot;;Felix, pp. 97–102.; He was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for his work with the division.

The brigade commander had also said that &quot;word of Major Clark's exceptional talent spread&quot;, and in one case reached the desk of then Supreme Allied Commander Alexander Haig. Haig personally selected Clark to serve as a special assistant on his staff, a post he held from February 1978 to June 1979. While on staff at SHAPE, Clark wrote policy reports and coordinated two multinational military exercises. As a result of his work on Haig's staff, Clark was promoted to lieutenant colonel and was awarded the Legion of Merit. After his European post, he moved on to Fort Carson, Colorado where he served first as the executive officer of the 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division from August 1979 to February 1980, then as the commander of the 1st Battalion, 77th Armor, 4th Infantry Division from February 1980 to July 1982. According to the American journalist David Halberstam, the commander at Fort Carson had a reputation of disliking West Point graduates and fast-rising officers such as Clark.;Felix, p. 105. &quot;The commander at Fort Carson, Gen. John Hudacheck, had a well-known aversion to West Point cadets and fast-risers like Clark. Even though Clark made quick and outstanding progress with the armor unit, Hudacheck expressed his attitude towards Clark by omitting him from a list of battalion commanders selected to greet a congressional delegation visiting the base.&quot;;;''War in a Time of Peace: Bush, Clinton, and the Generals'', by David Halberstam, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001, pp. 432–433.; After two years of not making the list to rise from battalion commander to brigade commander, Clark decided to attend the National War College. After studying there from June 1982 to 1983, Clark graduated and was promoted to full colonel in October 1983.;;Felix, pp. 102–110.;

Portrait of Brigadier General Clark as a commander at Fort Irwin
Following his graduation, Clark worked in Washington, D.C. from July 1983 to 1984 in the offices of the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the United States Army, and earned a second Legion of Merit for his work. He then served as the Operations Group commander at the Fort Irwin Military Reservation from August 1984 to June 1986. He was awarded yet another Legion of Merit and a Meritorious Service Medal for his work at Fort Irwin, and was then given a brigade command at Fort Carson in 1986. He commanded the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry there from April 1986 to March 1988. Veneta Clark, Wesley's mother, fell ill as he began this command and died on Mother's Day in 1986. After Fort Carson, Clark returned to the Command and General Staff College to direct and further develop the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) there until October 1989. The BCTP was created to teach senior officers war-fighting skills, according to the commanding general at the time.;Further information on the BCTP can be found at [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/ctc-bctp.htm Warfighter / Battle Command Training Program Exercises]. ''Global Security''. Retrieved February 9 2007.; Then on November 1 1989 Clark became a general with his promotion to Brigadier General#United States|brigadier general.;;Felix, pp. 110–116.;

Clark returned to Fort Irwin and commanded the National Training Center (NTC) from October 1989 to 1991. The Gulf War occurred during Clark's command, and many National Guard divisional round-out brigades trained under his command. Multiple generals commanding American forces in Iraq and Kuwait said Clark's training helped bring about results in the field and that he had successfully begun training a new generation of the military that had moved past Vietnam-era strategy. He was awarded yet another Legion of Merit for his &quot;personal efforts&quot; that were &quot;instrumental in maintaining&quot; the NTC, according to the citation. He served in yet another planning post after this, as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Concepts, Doctrine, and Developments at Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) at Fort Monroe, Virginia. While there, he helped the commanding general of TRADOC prepare the army for war and develop new post-Cold War strategies. One of Clark's major pushes was for technological advancement in the army to establish a digital network for military command that Clark called the &quot;digitization of the battlefield.&quot;;&quot;Digitization: Key to Landpower Dominance,&quot; by Wesley Clark for ''Army'' magazine, November 1993.; Clark was promoted to Major General#United States|Major General in October 1992 at the end of this command.;;Felix, pp. 116–120.;

Fort Hood and the Waco Siege

Clark's final divisional command came with the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas. Clark was in command during three separate deployments of forces from Fort Hood for peacekeeping in Kuwait.

Once promoted to a full 4-star general, Clark assumed command of USSOUTHCOM in June 1996.
Some critics, such as ''CounterPunch'' and FrontPageMag.com, have made allegations that Clark was, to some degree, involved in the Waco Siege, where 74 Branch Davidian followers were killed during the final raid, including their leader David Koresh. Groups making allegations of Clark's involvement note that Clark's second-in-command at the time, future General Peter Schoomaker, met with Texas governor Anne Richards and then-Attorney General Janet Reno, who were also allegedly involved with the siege. They also note that some military technology and personnel from Fort Hood, including two M1 Abrams tanks, were lent;[http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=9522 Wesley Clark: General Issues] by Lowell Pointe for Frontpage Magazine on August 25 2003. Retrieved February 3 2007.; to the FBI for the operation. Some also suggest that, given the sensitive nature of the materials lent for the operation, Clark had some knowledge of and perhaps a hand in planning the Waco Siege.;[http://www.counterpunch.org/waco2.html Delta Force at Waco] by Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair for CounterPunch on June 1 1999.

His final Officer Performance Report for his command at Fort Hood called him &quot;one of the Army's best and brightest&quot;; Clark was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his work at Fort Hood and was promoted to lieutenant general at the end of his command in April 1994. Clark's next assignment was an appointment as the Director, Strategic Plans and Policy (J5), on the staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), from April 1994 to June 1996.;;Felix, pp. 120–122.;

United States Southern Command
Army regulations set a so-called &quot;ticking clock&quot; upon the promotion to a three-star general, essentially requiring that Clark be promoted to another post within 2 years from his initial promotion or retire. This deadline ended in 1996 and Clark said he was not optimistic about receiving such a promotion because rumors at the time suggested General Dennis Reimer did not want to promote him although &quot;no specific reason was given&quot;.;Clark, ''Waging'', p. 68.; General Robert Scales admitted that it was likely Clark's reputation of intelligence within the military was responsible for feelings of resentment against him from other generals. Clark was named to the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) post despite these rumors. Congress approved his promotion to full general in June 1996, and General John M. Shalikashvili signed the order. Clark said he was not the original nominee, but the first officer chosen &quot;hadn't been accepted for some reason.&quot;;;Felix, pp. 131–134.;

=The Balkans=
Bosnia and Herzegovina

Clark began planning work for responses to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina upon his appointment in 1994 as the Director, Strategic Plans and Policy (J5) on the JCS staff. While collecting information to outline military options for resolving the conflict, Clark met with Bosnian military leaders including Ratko Mladić, who was later accused of war crimes and genocide. Clark was photographed exchanging hats with Mladić, and the photo drew controversy in the United States. A ''Washington Post'' story was published claiming Clark had made the visit despite a warning from the U.S. ambassador.;Clark, ''Waging'', p. 38; Some Clinton administration members privately said the incident was &quot;like cavorting with Hermann Göring.&quot;;[http://www.zpub.com/un/Clark's%20Military%20Record.htm Clark's Military Record] by KATHARINE Q.

Retrieved February 3 2007.; Clark had actually listed the visit in the itinerary he submitted to the ambassador, but says he learned only afterwards that the visit had never been approved. He also said there had been no warning and no one had told him to cancel the visit, although two Congressmen called for Clark's dismissal regardless. Clark later said he regretted the exchange,;Nominations before the Senate Armed Services Committee, First Session, 105th Congress. July 9 1997.; and the issue was ultimately resolved as President Clinton sent a letter defending Clark to the Congress and the controversy subsided.;Felix, pp. 125–126.; Clark said it was his &quot;first experience in the rough and tumble of high visibility... and a painful few days.&quot;;Clark, ''Waging'', p. 40.; Conservative pundit Robert Novak later referred to the hat exchange in a column during Clark's 2004 presidential campaign, citing it as a &quot;problem&quot; with Clark as a candidate.;[http://www.townhall.com/columnists/RobertDNovak/2003/09/22/the_trouble_with_wes The Trouble with Wes] by Robert Novak on Townhall.com on September 22 2003. Retrieved February 2 2007.;

Clark was sent to Bosnia by Secretary of Defense William Perry to serve as the military advisor to a diplomatic negotiating team headed by assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke. Holbrooke later described Clark's position as &quot;complicated&quot; because while it presented him with future possibilities it &quot;might put him into career-endangering conflicts with more senior officers.&quot;;''To End a War'' by Richard Holbrooke, New York: Random House, 1999, p. 9.; While the team was driving along a mountain road during the first week, the road gave way, and one of the vehicles fell over a cliff carrying passengers including Holbrooke's deputy, Robert Frasure, a deputy assistant Secretary of Defense, Joseph Kruzel, and Air Force Colonel Nelson Drew. Clark and Holbrooke attempted to crawl down the mountain, but were driven back by sniper fire. Once the fire ceased, Clark rappelled down the mountain to collect the bodies of two dead Americans left by Bosnian forces that had taken the wounded to a nearby hospital. After returning to Washington D.C. for funeral services, the negotiations continued and the team eventually reached the Dayton Agreement at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio and later signed it in Paris on December 14 1995.;Felix, pp. 126–129;

Clark's official portrait as SACEUR, courtesy of NATO
Clark returned to the European theater and the Balkans following his USSOUTHCOM position when he was appointed to U.S. European Command in the summer of 1997 by President Clinton. He was, as with SOUTHCOM, not the original nominee for the position. The Army had already selected another general for the post. Because President Clinton and General Shalikashvili believed Clark was the best man for the post, Clark eventually got the nomination. Shalikashvili noted he &quot;had a very strong role in [Clark's] last two jobs.&quot;;&quot;Wesley K.

Clark also addressed issues related to his then-current command of USSOUTHCOM, such as support for the School of the Americas and his belief that the United States must continue aid to some South American nations to effectively fight the War on Drugs.; Clark was quickly confirmed by a voice vote the same day as his confirmation hearing,;Nomination: PN382-105 on July 9 1997. Retrieved December 14 2006 from [http://www.thomas.gov/ Thomas.gov].; giving him the command of 109,000 American troops, their 150,000 family members, 50,000 civilians aiding the military, and all American military activities in 89 countries and territories of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.;Felix, p. 137.; The position made Clark the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), which granted him overall command of NATO military forces in Europe.

Kosovo War

The largest event of Clark's tenure as SACEUR was NATO's confrontation with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War. The United Nations Security Council introduced Resolution 1199 calling for an end to hostilities in Kosovo, and Richard Holbrooke again tried to negotiate a peace. This process came to an unsuccessful end, however, following the Račak incident. Then U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tried to force Yugoslavia into allowing separation of Kosovo with the Rambouillet Agreement, which Yugoslavia refused. Clark was at the Rambouillet talks and tried to convince Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milošević by telling him &quot;there's an activation order. And if they tell me to bomb you, I'm going to bomb you good.&quot; Clark later said Milošević launched into an emotional tirade against Albanians and said that they'd been &quot;handled&quot; in the 1940s by killing large numbers of them.;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kosovo/interviews/clark.html Interview with Wesley Clark] for PBS ''Frontline''.;;Felix, pp. 138–140.;

Clark briefing two fighter squadrons deployed to Aviano Air Base in Italy on May 9 1999
Clark started the bombings codenamed Operation Allied Force on March 24 1999 on orders to try and enforce UN Resolution 1199 following Yugoslavia's refusal of the Rambouillet Agreement. Secretary of Defense William Cohen felt that Clark had powerful allies at the White House such as President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that were allowing him to circumvent The Pentagon in promoting his strategic ideas, while Clark felt he was not being included enough in discussions with the National Command Authority, leading Clark to describe himself as &quot;just a NATO officer who also reported to the United States&quot;.;Clark, ''Waging'', p. 342.; This command conflict came to a ceremonial head when Clark was not initially invited to a summit in Washington, D.C. to commemorate NATO's 50th anniversary, despite being its supreme military commander. Clark eventually secured an invitation to the summit, but was told by Cohen to say nothing about ground troops, and Clark agreed.;Clark, ''Waging'', p. 269.;

Clark returned to SHAPE following the summit and briefed the press on the continued bombing operations. A reporter from the ''Los Angeles Times'' asked a question about the effect of bombings on Serbian forces, and Clark noted that merely counting the number of opposing troops did not show Milošević's true losses because he was bringing in reinforcements. Many American news organizations capitalized on the remark in a way Clark said &quot;distorted the comment&quot; with headlines such as &quot;NATO Chief Admits Bombs Fail to Stem Serb Operations&quot; in ''The New York Times''. Clark later defended his remarks, saying this was a &quot;complete misunderstanding of my statement and of the facts,&quot; and President Clinton agreed Clark's remarks had been misconstrued. Regardless, Clark received a call the following evening from General Hugh Shelton who said he had been told by Secretary Cohen to deliver a piece of guidance verbatim. &quot;Get your fucking face off the TV. No more briefings, period. That's it.&quot;;Clark, ''Waging'', p. 273.;;Felix, pp. 140–143.;

Operation Allied Force reached another problem when NATO bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7 1999. The operation had been organized against numerous Serbian targets, including &quot;Target 493, the Federal Procurement and Supply Directorate Headquarters&quot;, although the intended target building was actually 300 meters away from the targeted area. The embassy was located at this mistaken target, and three Chinese journalists were killed. Clark's intelligence officer called Clark taking full responsibility and offering to resign, but Clark declined, saying it was not the officer's fault. Secretary Cohen and CIA Director George Tenet took responsibility the next day. Tenet would later explain in testimony before the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on July 22 1999 that the targeting system used street addresses, which gave inaccurate positions for air bombings and that the various databases of off-limit targets did not have the up-to-date address for the relatively new embassy location.;;;Clark, ''Waging'', pp. 296–297.;

Milošević's term in office in Yugoslavia was coming to an end, and he began enacting a series of policies seen merely as attempts to preserve his power. The elections came on September 24 2000, but protests grew from allegations of fraud and rigged elections that came to a head on October 5 in the so-called Bulldozer Revolution. Milošević resigned on October 7. The Democratic Opposition of Serbia won a majority in parliamentary elections that December.

=Priština International Airport=
One of Clark's most argued decisions during his SACEUR command was his attempted operation at Priština International Airport immediately after the end of the Kosovo War. Russian forces had arrived in Kosovo and were heading for the airport on June 12 1999, two days after the bombing campaign ended, expecting to help police that section of Kosovo. Clark, on the other hand, had planned for the Kosovo Force to police the area. Clark called then-Secretary General of NATO Javier Solana, and was told &quot;of course you have to get to the airport&quot; and &quot;you have transfer of authority&quot; in the area. The British commander of the Kosovo Force, General Mike Jackson, however refused to block the Russians through military action saying &quot;I'm not going to start the Third World War for you.&quot; Jackson has said he refused to take action because he did not believe it was worth the risk of a military confrontation with the Russians.

Civilian career
Clark had earned an average of US$40,000 per year over the course of his military career and, according to ''The New York Times'', retired with &quot;precious little in the bank to show for years of public service.&quot;;&quot;General Clark and the Hustings: Complexity and Contradiction,&quot; ''The New York Times'', November 23 2003.; Clark set himself three initial goals in civilian life — to earn $40 million in the business world to let him practice philanthropy, to become a professor, and to become a professional golfer. Clark's inspiration for philanthropy came from billionaire George Soros. Clark began a public speaking tour in the summer of 2000 and approached several former government officials for advice on work after life in government, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty, and Richard Holbrooke. Clark took McLarty's advice to move back to Little Rock, Arkansas, and took a position with the Stephens Group, an investment firm headquartered there. He took several other board positions at defense-related firms, and in March 2003 he amicably left the Stephens Group to found Wesley K. Clark &amp; Associates. Clark began writing, publishing two books — ''Waging Modern War'' and ''Winning Modern Wars'' — along with writing the forewords for a series of military biographies, as well as a series of editorials.;[http://securingamerica.com/taxonomy/term/11 op-eds] from Securing America.

Clark had a conversation with Condoleezza Rice. She told him that the war in Kosovo would have never taken place under a Bush administration, as they adhered more to realpolitik. Clark found such an administration unsettling, as he had been selected for the SACEUR position because he believed more in the interventionist policies of the Clinton administration.

Clark met with a group of wealthy New York Democrats including Alan Patricof to tell them he was considering running for the presidency in the 2004 election. Patricof, a supporter of Al Gore in 2000, met with all the Democratic candidates and ultimately supported Clark in 2004. Clark has said that he voted for Al Gore in 2000, but has voted for Republicans such as Ronald Reagan, held equal esteem for Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman, and had been a registered Independent (politician)#United States|independent voter throughout his military career. Ultimately as Clark himself put it, however, he decided he was a Democrat because &quot;I was pro-affirmative action, I was pro-choice, I was pro-education... I'm pro-health care...

Clark, coming from a non-political background, had no position papers to define his agenda for the public. Once in the campaign, however, several volunteers established a network of connections with the media, and Clark began to explain his stances on a variety of issues. He was, as he had told ''The Washington Post'' in October, pro-choice and pro-affirmative action. He called for a repeal of recent Bush tax cuts for people earning more than $200,000 and suggested providing healthcare for the uninsured by altering the current system rather than transferring to a completely new universal health care system. He backed environmental causes such as promising to reverse &quot;scaled down rules&quot; the Bush administration had applied to the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and dealing with global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Clark also proposed a global effort to strengthen American relations with other nations, reviewing the PATRIOT Act, and investing $100 billion in homeland security.
