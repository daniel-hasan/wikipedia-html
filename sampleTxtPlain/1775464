''Lost and Safe'' is a 2005 album by The Books.It is in the same aleatoric style of their previous albums and continues their rich use of samples as diverse as Raymond Baxter (&quot;That's the picture. You s-you see it for yourself.&quot;), W. H. Auden (&quot;This great society is going smash / A culture is no better than its woods&quot;, from his poem &quot;Bucolics: II, Woods&quot;), and a reading of Lewis Carroll's poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;. On &quot;If Not Now, Whenever&quot; Mal Sharpe asks a passerby &quot;How're you doin' today?&quot; Some of the sampled passages are either accompanied or performed elsewhere by guitarist/bassist Nick Zammuto in Sprechstimme. Some of the eclecticism of the samples is owed to their origins in Salvation Army shops.[http://www.dallasobserver.com/Issues/2006-04-06/music/music.html]
