''&quot;Manos&quot; The Hands of Fate'', often abbreviated to ''Manos'', is a 1966 American horror film written, directed and produced by El Paso fertilizer salesman Harold P. Warren. Warren also starred in the film, alongside El Paso theater actors Tom Neyman and John Reynolds. The film is best known for having been featured in a 1993 episode of the television comedy series ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' (''MST3K''), a show based on the premise of mocking B-movies, which gave the film cult status.

The plot of the film revolves primarily around a vacationing family taking a road trip to a hotel. After a long drive in the Texas desert, the family is trapped at a lodge maintained by a polygamous pagan cult and they attempt to escape as the cult's members decide what to do with them.

Produced as a result of a bet, ''Manos'' was an independent production by a crew that had little or no background or experience in filmmaking and with a very limited budget at their disposal. Upon its theatrical debut, the film was critically slammed, and remained in obscurity until its ''Mystery Science Theater'' appearance. It has since gained infamy as one of the worst films ever made.

Production
The character of Torgo was intended to be a satyr; actor John Reynolds wore metal rigging under his trousers.
The film was the result of a bet Warren made with screenplay writer Stirling Silliphant that he could create a successful horror film on a very limited budget. Warren accumulated a small sum of cash, reportedly $19,000, and hired a group of actors from a local theater and modeling agency.;Ross, Dalton.

Under the working title ''The Lodge of Sins'', the movie was filmed in the summer of 1966 with a 16&amp;nbsp;mm Böwe Bell &amp; Howell|Bell &amp; Howell camera which had to be wound by hand and only filmed for 32 seconds. This is credited as a possible explanation for the many editing problems present in the final cut.;Walker, Albert.

Early in production one of the actresses broke her leg, and Warren rewrote her role to have her make out in a car with an actor during the events of the entire film. The inclusion of these characters has been the focus of criticism for having no apparent connection to the main plot of the film.;;Rice, Forrest.

To portray his character Torgo as a satyr, John Reynolds constructed what is described as a metallic rigging worn under his trousers.;;[http://www.mst3kinfo.com/daddyo/di_424.html 424 - Manos, The Hands of Fate.] Daddy-O's Drive-In Dirt.

Night time proved hard for Warren to work with (for whatever reason, Warren chose not to use the normal technique of shooting day-for-night). In many of the night scenes, the camera and lights attracted swarms of moths, which can be seen in the film's final production.;[http://www.badmovies.org/movies/manos/ Manos, The Hands of Fate.] BadMovies.org, 2003-03-30.

Retrieved on 2007-04-23.;

Post production efforts were reportedly minimal, despite promises by Warren that any problems in the film would be fixed in later editing.;;;Brandt, Richard.

Retrieved on 2007-04-24.; One of the more visible examples of this is a brief moment at the beginning of the film in which the clapboard is visible after a cut to the &quot;make-out couple&quot; (to add insult to injury, the clapboard was not even necessary because there was no sound on set).;; It is rumored that the entire opening sequence, which consisted of the main characters driving around looking for their hotel for minutes on end with minimal dialogue or effect on the plot, was the result of such neglect. Warren had intended to include opening credits at this stage of the film, but forgot or was unable to add them.;;

Reportedly, Warren's small crew became so bemused by his amateurishness and wiktionary:irascible|irascibility that they derisively called the movie ''Mangos, the Cans of Fruit'' behind his back.;;;

Plot
The film opens with footage of Michael (Harold P. Warren|Warren), his wife Margaret (Diane Mahree), their young daughter Debbie (Jackey Neyman Jones) and their dog, Peppy, on a driving holiday, searching for the &quot;Valley Lodge&quot;. There are also scenes in this sequence involving a teenage couple who are necking in a convertible. They are interrupted by a police officer, who tells them to move their car. In the meantime, Michael and his family finally reach a house which is tended by a bizarre, satyr-like person named Torgo (John Reynolds) with an erratic, repetitive speech pattern.He frequently refers to someone called &quot;the Master&quot; as the apparent owner of the house.Michael and Margaret ask Torgo for directions to Valley Lodge;Torgo simply replies that, &quot;''There is no way out of here. It'll be dark soon. There is no way out of here.''&quot; With this information, Michael asks Torgo to let him and his family stay the night, despite objections from both Torgo and Margaret. Torgo ultimately relents. Inside the home, the two visitors see a disturbing painting of a dark, malevolent-looking man and a black dog with glowing eyes. Torgo identifies the man as &quot;the Master&quot;, whom he describes as being away, but &quot;''not dead the way you know it.''&quot;

Peppy then runs outside, barking continuously for a while, before falling silent. Michael investigates, retrieving a flashlight and revolver from his car. He discovers that the dog has been killed by an unknown force. When informed of this, Margaret demands they leave, and Michael orders Torgo to put the luggage back in the car. Torgo does this, but has developed an attraction to Margaret. He confronts her and crudely gropes her hair. He tells her that, although she is doomed to become yet another bride of the Master, he intends to keep her for himself. Margaret threatens to tell Michael of Torgo's advances, but Torgo convinces her not to say anything to her husband by promising to protect her. Michael then returns, unable to start the car. With the revelation that there are no phones at the home, Torgo brings the luggage back into the room.

An image from the inexplicably unconnected plotline of the &quot;make-out couple&quot;, highlighted to show a failure to edit out the clapboard.The film returns to the teenage couple who were seen earlier. They are still petting, in the middle of the night, and are sent on their way by the same policeman as before, who is joined by his partner. The teenagers mention a second couple (Michael and Margaret) who they had seen driving on the road earlier.

At the lodge, Debbie leaves unexpectedly to search for her dog. A frightened Michael and Margaret find her leading the dog seen in the painting. Debbie releases the dog and runs to her parents, who tell her to never run away again. The parents ask where she found the dog, and Debbie leads them to a tomb-like structure where &quot;The Master&quot; (Tom Neyman) and several women dressed in translucent night gowns, later revealed to be his wives, lie in slumber. In horror, the family runs back to the house, and Michael leaves to seek an explanation from Torgo.

Torgo has gone to the tomb himself, where he fondles the wives and berates the sleeping Master before knocking out Michael, tying him to a pole, and returning to the house to sleep. The Master suddenly comes to life and wakes his wives, and a short argument over the fate of the family ensues. One faction of the Master's wives wants to sacrifice the family whole; another faction prefers to spare Michael's wife and daughter. The Master angrily stops the argument, and decides to sacrifice Torgo (whose earlier rantings he could hear, even though he appeared unconscious) and his first wife to the film's mysterious deity and namesake, &quot;Manos&quot;. He then makes his way back to the house to find Torgo. While the Master is gone, the women continue arguing over whether or not to kill Debbie, as well as who has the Master's favor. The argument soon degenerates into a fight, and the women wrestle in the sand for several minutes. 

The Master confronts Torgo in the home, where he informs Torgo of his fate. Torgo offers some resistance, but ultimately succumbs to what appears to be a hypnotic spell by the Master. At the same time one of the Master's wives leaves the tomb, and appears to kiss and then slap the unconscious Michael. She then warns the Master of the unexpected brawl that has begun, and the two return with Torgo to the tomb. The Master stops the fight, and then has his first wife tied to a pole to be sacrificed. Torgo is then laid on a stone bed, where the wives subject him to what one El Paso reviewer likened at the time to &quot;Torgo being massaged to death&quot;.;; This in itself does not prove fatal. The Master then evokes some mysterious power, severing and horribly burning Torgo's left hand. Torgo runs off into the darkness, his fate unknown. The Master then orders the family to be found. In a scene cut from the ''Mystery Science Theater'' airing, the Master also sacrifices his first wife.

Michael regains consciousness and rejoins the family. They attempt to escape, but encounter a rattlesnake, which is rendered via stock footage.; Michael opens fire at the snake, which alerts the policemen who had been shown earlier. However, the policemen decide not to investigate the shooting, claiming it could be across the Mexican border. Michael and his family decide to go back to the home, and barricade themselves in one of the rooms. The Master confronts them. Michael fires several shots into the Master's face, at point-blank range, but they have no effect. The screen fades to black, indicating that the Master has again applied his hypnotic power.

The film ends with a coda involving two girls, driving in a convertible. They become lost, and stop at the home to ask for directions. They are greeted by an entranced Michael. A number of jump cuts show us the fate of Margaret and Debbie: like the other wives of the Master, they sleep in the tomb, dressed in flowing white robes. The film concludes with Michael saying, &quot;I take care of the place while the Master is away,&quot; just as Torgo had done when first seen. The production credits are superimposed over what Joel describes in the ''MST3K'' cut as outtakes from the film with the words &quot;The End?&quot; on the screen at the very end.

Reception
The film premiered on November 15, 1966, at the Capri Theater in Warren's hometown of El Paso, Texas. Warren arranged for a searchlight to be used at the cinema,; and for the cast to be brought to the premiere by a limousine, in order to enhance the Hollywood feel of the event. Only a single limousine could be afforded, however, and as a result the driver had to drop off one group, then drive around the block and pick up another.;Ross, Dalton.

Retrieved on 2006-11-04.; The premiere was also attended by numerous local dignitaries, including the Mayor and local Sheriff. Shortly after the film began, the audience began laughing at its poor quality and redundant dialogue. Humiliated, Warren and the rest of his cast made a hasty exit. The film ended to a mixture of laughter and applause. In light of the film's reception, Warren suggested that ''Manos'' might make a passable comedy if redubbed.;

The film was briefly distributed by Emerson Releasing Corporation. Reports that the only crew members who were compensated for their work in the film were Jackey Neyman Jones and her family's dog, who received a bicycle and a large quantity of dog food respectively, would indicate that the film failed to break even financially.;; Official box office figures for the film are currently unknown, if indeed they ever existed.

The ''MST3K'' version of the episode was released on DVD on its own in 2001, and in the ''Mystery Science Theater 3000 Essentials'' collection in 2004.;[http://www.dvdreview.com/quickpeek/collect/580.shtml Mystery Science Theater 3000: Manos, The Hands Of Fate.] DVDreview.com, 2001-11-19.

Despite its newly gained cult popularity, the general opinion on the quality of the film remains much the same.

''Mystery Science Theater 3000''

The film was featured in an episode of ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' on January 30, 1993, in the final episode of season four, preceded by the second half of the short Chevrolet training film &quot;''Hired!''&quot; The &quot;bots&quot; (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot|Crow) used the long uneventful drive at the beginning of the movie to repeat the title of the movie numerous times, as there was yet to be any action to mock. During the host segment breaks, Joel and the &quot;bots&quot; mocked the film's opening sequence, debated whether or not Torgo should be considered a monster, and impersonated &quot;The Master&quot; and his dog. At one point during their sketches, both the bots broke down into tears due to the poor quality of the movie, which was beyond even their attempts at making it interesting. After the film had finished, the slow-moving Torgo, played by Michael J. Nelson|Mike Nelson, appeared at the &quot;mads&quot; (Dr. Clayton Forrester and TV's Frank) lair to deliver a pizza two hours after it was ordered.;[http://www.mst3kinfo.com/episodes/epfour.html SEASON FOUR: 1992-1993.] Satellite News.

In addition, both TV's Frank and Dr. Forrester were depicted apologizing for showing the film, which even they had to admit was abysmal and went beyond their jobs of sending up bad movies, in the first and third break respectively.; This was a rare, if not unique, occurrence.

In the ''MST3K'' episode guide, the show's team of writers stated that they still feel ''Manos'' is the worst movie they ever covered, and that the film subsequently &quot;became the standard by which all others are measured.&quot;

''Manos'' has been described as one of the best, if not the best, episode of the series.;[http://www.noisetosignal.org/tv/2006/08/mst3k-a-beginners-guide.php Noise To Signal]: MST3K: A Beginner's Guide;;Ross, Dalton.

Cast
*Harold P. Warren as Michael.
*Diane Mahree as Margret.
*Jackey Neyman Jones as Debbie.
*John Reynolds as Torgo.
*Tom Neyman as The Master.

=Minor characters=
*The Master's Wives (played by Stephanie Nielson, Sherry Proctor, Robin Redd, Jay Hall and Bettie Burns).
*&quot;The Make-Out Couple&quot; (played by Bernie Rosenblum and Joyce Molleur). Two teenagers who spend the entire film making out in a car. Their role in the film is unclear.
*The Police Officers (played by William Bryan Jennings and George Cavender). Two police officers who spend the film attempting to get the &quot;make out couple&quot; to move their car. Near the film's climax, they make what appears to be a very half-hearted attempt to investigate the events at the lodge.

=After ''Manos''=
The majority of the cast and crew never appeared in another movie after ''Manos''. Harold P. Warren attempted to pitch another script he had written called ''Wild Desert Bikers'', but with the failure of ''Manos'' no one he approached showed any interest in producing it.; Attempts to turn the screenplay into a novel were equally unsuccessful.;

John Reynolds committed suicide prior to the film's November debut,; reportedly either through a self-inflicted gunshot wound; or a drug overdose.; Some accounts claim he suffered from a drug addiction and according to Jackey Neyman Jones, Reynolds was usually quite high during filming.;; Unsubstantiated rumors claimed that other cast members had also killed themselves shortly after the release of the movie: Diane Mahree, the female lead; Sherry Proctor, one of The Master's wives; and Joyce Molleur, the female half of the &quot;make-out couple.&quot; However, the makers of ''Hotel Torgo'', a 2004 documentary about ''Manos'', researched these rumors and found them to be false.
