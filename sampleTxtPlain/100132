In Hinduism, the Daityas (दैत्‍य) were the children of Diti and the sage Kashyapa. They were a race of giants who fought against the gods because they were jealous of their Deva half-brothers. Some known Daityas include Bali, Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha. They are also called Asuras, but that name is also used for the Danavas.
