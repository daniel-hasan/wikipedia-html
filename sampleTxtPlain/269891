''Porno'' is a novel by Scottish writer Irvine Welsh, and is the sequel to ''Trainspotting''.
The book describes the characters of Trainspotting nine years after the events of the earlier book, as their paths cross again, this time with the pornography business as the backdrop rather than heroin use. A number of characters from ''Glue'' make an appearance as well.

This sequel picks up ideas of the film adaptation of ''Trainspotting''. One example is the fact that &quot;Spud&quot; has received his share of the drug money, which is shown in the film, but only alluded to in the book.

Plot summary

The novel is divided into 3 sections, each of which comprises chapters with different narrators. Unlike ''Trainspotting'' which had more narrational diversity, ''Porno'' is reduced to just 5 narrators: Sick Boy, Renton, Spud, Begbie and Nikki. Another difference from the format of ''Trainspotting'' is that each character has a defined chapter heading. Sick Boy's chapters all begin with &quot;Scam...&quot; and then a prison number in front of a &quot;#&quot;. Renton's all begin with &quot;The Whores of Amsterdam Part...&quot; depending on what chapter it is. Spud's chapters are just narrative, Begbie's are in capitals, and Nikki's are quoted. &quot;...A SIMON DAVID WILLIAMSON PRODUCTION...&quot; for example.

Each narrator is associated with a distinctive prose style.Renton, Sick Boy, and Nikki's chapters are written almost entirely in &quot;standard&quot; English while Begbie and Spud's chapters are in Scots.For example, in Chapter 25, Spud narrates, &quot;So ah'm downcast when ah git intae the library, thinkin tae masel&quot; (&quot;So I'm downcast when I get into the library thinking to myself&quot;). Sick Boy's returning grandiose nature is featured in imagined interviews with John Gibson of the ''Evening News'' and Alex McLeish. 

=Section 1: Stag=
Simon 'Sick Boy' Williamson leaves the London Cocaine#Crack cocaine|crack scene and returns to Leith when he comes into ownership of his aunt's pub. Convinced that the area is destined to become a social and cultural hub, Simon decides to focus his energy into making the pub a classier establishment.

Nikki Fuller-Smith is a university student who works part time in a massage parlour. Rab, a university acquaintance, introduces her to his friend Terry Lawson and his underground, homemade pornography operation. The scene interests Nikki.

Danny 'Spud' Murphy has been regularly attending group sessions in an attempt to kick his drug habit. His relationship with his wife Alison is strained and Spud feels like he has become a burden on her. He considers his life insurance policy and contemplates suicide.

Meanwhile, in Amsterdam, Mark Renton is co-owner of a successful nightclub. One night, a DJ from his hometown plays at one of his clubs and recognises him.

When Sick Boy learns of Terry's operation, he offers the use of the upstairs bar to shoot some scenes. During their first meeting, the group begins planning to film a full length adult film.

The first section concludes with &quot;OOTSIDE&quot;, a chapter noting the release into society of Francis Begbie.

=Section 2: Porno=
While in prison, Begbie received packages of gay porn, sent anonymously by Sick Boy. Upon his release, he determines to find the culprit. While accompanying an old friend on a debt collection errand he meets Kate and begins a relationship with her.

When Alison begins working at Sick Boy's pub and Sick Boy deliberately attempts to sabotage her relationship with Spud, the friendship between Spud and Sick Boy is strained. During one thinly veiled argument, Spud reveals that he received his share of the money from Renton. He also unveils his recent ambition, to write a history of Leith.
 
Begbie visits Sick Boy's pub. As the two converse, Sick Boy considers the duplicitous trait of opportunity and threat accompanying Begbie's release.

Soon after, Terry, Rab and several other friends arrive and begin discussing their upcoming trip to Amsterdam, a bachelor celebration for Rab. Sick Boy is initially reluctant to attend but changes his mind after Carl, a DJ, mentions that he worked at a club in Amsterdam that was owned by Mark Renton.

=Section 3: Exhibition=
Sick Boy's &quot;Porno&quot; shot becomes a slow demolish of his so-called mates. Spud turns out soon after Begbie threatens him in front of his family, Renton decides to leave with his strong relationship with Dianne, Nikki leaves him after &quot;understandin the real Simon&quot;, and Begbie becomes even more psychotic. And is now on Sick Boy's side.

Begbie gets hit by a car trying to run across the road to Renton, who runs off with Nikki and Dianne, as well as Sickboy's Â£60,000.
