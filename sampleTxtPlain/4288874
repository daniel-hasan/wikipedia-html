In the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' fantasy role-playing game, goblins are a very common and fairly weak race of Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|evil Humanoid (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|humanoid monsters. Goblins and Kobold (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Kobolds are often the first type of non-human monsters that low-level player characters will face. In D&amp;D, unlike in many other fantasy role playing games, goblins aren't smaller cousins of Orc (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|orcs, but are a part of the related species collectively referred to as goblinoids. Goblinoids include Hobgoblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|hobgoblins, Bugbear (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|bugbears, and others.

Description
Goblins are small humanoid monsters. They vary in height from about 3 to 3 Â½ feet and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. They walk upright even though their arms nearly reach their knees. Their eyes vary from red to yellow and are usually dull and glazed. They have a broad nose that sits on a flat face with pointed ears and a wide mouth. Their mouth contains small, but sharp fangs. Their skin pigment ranges from a deep red through nearly any shade of orange to yellow. Members of the same tribe tend to have the same skin color. Based on their ability scores the average goblin would be able to lift about 60 pounds over his head.

Society
Goblins usually live in tribes which are ruled by the strongest goblin in the group. These tribes vary in size from gangs of 4-9 to tribes of up to 400. Most larger tribes have wolves or dire wolves as mounts, or ally themselves with Worg (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|worgs, which also carry them into battle. Goblin tribes usually settle near civilized areas to raid for food, livestock, tools, weapons, and supplies. Some goblin clans will come under the control of stronger goblinoids or other creatures, who will use the goblins for their own purposes.

In most campaign settings, Maglubiyet, the god of war and rulership, is the chief deity of goblins.Other gods worshipped by the goblins include Khurgorbaeyag, the god of slavery, oppression, and morale, and Bargrivyek, the god of co-operation and territory.
