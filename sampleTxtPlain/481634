A native of Cork, Murphy began his performing career as a rock musician. After turning down a record deal, he made his professional acting debut in the play ''Disco Pigs'' in 1996. He went on to star in Irish and UK film and stage productions throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, first coming to international attention in 2003 as the hero in the Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic film ''28 Days Later''. Murphy's best-known roles are as villains in two 2005 blockbusters: the Scarecrow in the superhero film ''Batman Begins'', and Jackson Rippner in the thriller ''Red Eye''. Next came two contrasting, widely acclaimed starring roles: his Golden Globe Award-nominated performance as transgendered outcast &quot;Kitten&quot; in 2005's ''Breakfast on Pluto'' and a turn as a 1920s Irish revolutionary in 2006 Palme d'Or winner ''The Wind That Shakes the Barley''. 2007 saw Murphy on the London stage in ''Love Song'' and onscreen in science fiction film ''Sunshine''.

Murphy attended the Catholic school Presentation Brothers College, where he did well academically,; although he did get into trouble often, sometimes getting suspended, until deciding in his fourth year that misbehaving was not worth the hassle. Not keen on sport, a major part of life at PBC, Murphy found that creative pursuits were not fully nurtured at the school.; Still, it was there that he got his first taste of performing, when he participated in a drama module presented by Pat Kiernan, the director of the Corcadorca Theatre Company. Murphy later described the experience as a &quot;huge high&quot; and a &quot;fully alive&quot; feeling that he set out to chase.;Jackson, Joe. &quot;From Cork to Gotham&quot;, ''Sunday Independent Life Magazine'', 8 February 2004.; His English teacher, the poet and novelist William Wall, encouraged him to pursue acting,; but at this stage, to Murphy, performing meant dreams of becoming a rock star.;

Because Murphy's brother was still in secondary school, their parents disapproved. Additionally, the contract offered little money and would have ceded the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label.;

Also in 1996, Murphy began studying law at University College Cork (UCC), but he failed his first year exams because, as he put it, he had &quot;no ambitions to do it.&quot;; Not only was he busy with his band,; but he has admitted that he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was the wrong fit for his artistic personality.; Furthermore, after seeing Corcadorca's stage production of ''A Clockwork Orange'', directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest.; His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of ''Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme'', but, according to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an acting career.; Nonetheless, he began to transition away from working as a rock musician, about which he later remarked, &quot;I think there's such a thing as a performance gene. If it's in your DNA it needs to come out. For me it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there. I always needed to get up and perform.&quot;;

Murphy as Jackson Rippner in ''Red Eye'' (2005), with Rachel McAdams

;
2005 was the year that Cillian Murphy won wider recognition, first for two high-profile villain roles: Dr. Jonathan Crane in ''Batman Begins'', and Jackson Rippner in the thriller ''Red Eye''. Originally asked to audition for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman in ''Batman Begins'', Murphy never saw himself as having the right physique for the superhero, but leaped at the chance to connect with director Christopher Nolan.; Though the lead went to Christian Bale, Nolan was so impressed with Murphy that he gave him the supporting role of Dr. Crane, whose alter ego is supervillain Scarecrow.; Nolan told ''Spin'', &quot;He has the most extraordinary eyes, and I kept trying to invent excuses for him to take his glasses off in close-ups.&quot;;Itzkoff, Dave. &quot;Cillian's Irish Dread&quot;, ''Spin'', June 2005.; In Wes Craven's ''Red Eye'', Murphy starred as an operative in an assassination plot who terrorizes Rachel McAdams on an overnight flight.

In late 2005 (early 2006 in Europe), Murphy starred as Patrick &quot;Kitten&quot; Braden, a transgendered Irish orphan in search of his mother, in Neil Jordan's dramedy ''Breakfast on Pluto'', based on the novel of the same title by Patrick McCabe. Murphy had auditioned for the role in 2001, and though Jordan liked him for the part, ''The Crying Game'' director was hesitant to revisit transgender and I.R.A. issues. For several years, Murphy lobbied Jordan to make the film before the actor became too old to play the part. In 2004, Murphy prepared for the role by meeting with a transvestite who dressed him and took him clubbing with other transvestites. Taking notice of the group's quick wit, Murphy attributed it to their constantly having to respond to insults from prejudiced people around them.;

Against ''Breakfast on Pluto''&amp;rsquo;s kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s glitter rock fashion, magic shows, red light districts and I.R.A. violence, Murphy transforms from androgynous teen to high drag blond bombshell. ''The San Francisco Chronicles Ruthe Stein said of his performance, &quot;Murphy projects enormous energy onscreen, as he's already shown in ''28 Days Later...'' and ''Red Eye''.

Accessed 25 September 2007.; and became the most successful Irish independent film at the Irish box office.; Director Loach, a social realist who shoots films in sequence, is strict about casting actors from the areas where his films are set, rarely casting well-known faces. Because the film was set in Cork, Murphy was given a chance at the role of Damien O'Donovan, a young doctor turned revolutionary, but he had to audition six times before winning the part. Murphy's family goes back in Cork for many generations; during the time period in which ''The Wind That Shakes the Barley'' is set, his grandfather was shot at by British soldiers for playing Irish music.;

Critic Denby described Murphy's approach to the part of Damien: &quot;Murphy is normally very quiet in movies; he has attained his mystique as an actor by staring at people with baby-blue eyes. In this film, too, he has, at times, a deep stillness, but he has idiosyncratic moments as well, such as when Damien has to execute a teen-ager who has ratted on the I.R.A. Murphy, writhing, shoots the boy and stumbles away, nausea struggling against duty.&quot;; Kenneth Turan of the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote, &quot;Murphy is especially good at playing the zealotry as well as the soul-searching and the regret, at showing us a man who is eaten up alive because he's forced to act in ways that are contrary to his background and his training.&quot;;Turan, Kenneth.

[http://www.nervepop.com/filmlounge/interview/cillianmurphy/index.aspx &quot;Q&amp;A: Cillian Murphy&quot;], ''Nerve'', 16 March 2007. Accessed 22 August 2007.;

Personal life
;

Murphy married his long-time; live-in girlfriend, artist Yvonne McGuinness, in the summer of 2004 in Provence, France. The couple live in west London, with their son Malachy,; who was born in late 2005.; Murphy is known for being reluctant to speak about his personal life. He frequently gives interviews about his work but does not do TV chat show appearances where actors customarily share information about their private lives.; He does not have a stylist; or a personal publicist, travels without an entourage,; and often attends premieres alone. Shy and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene, finding the red carpet experience &quot;a challenge... and not one I want to overcome.&quot;; He intentionally practices a lifestyle that will not interest the tabloids: &quot;I haven't created any controversy, I don't sleep around, I don't go and fall down drunk.&quot;; Murphy is friends with fellow Irish actors Colin Farrell;Didcock, Barry. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20050612/ai_n14679938 &quot;The Man Behind the Mask: The Scarecrow Speaks&quot;], ''The Sunday Herald'', 12 June 2005. Archived on ''FindArticles.com'', accessed 21 July 2007.; and Liam Neeson, looking up to the latter like a &quot;surrogate movie dad.&quot;;Halper, Jenny. [http://www.cinecon.com/news.php?id=0511153 &quot;Interview: Cillian Murphy on ''Breakfast on Pluto''&quot;], ''Cinema Confidential'', 15 November 2005. Accessed 20 July 2007.; But primarily, Murphy's close friends are those he made before becoming a star.;;Cashin, Declan. [http://lowlyjourno.blogspot.com/2007/04/interview-from-day-and-night-magazine.html &quot;Reluctant Hero&quot;], ''Irish Independent'', 6 April 2007. Accessed 6 August 2007.;

Music is still an important part of Murphy's life. In 2004, he said, &quot;The only extravagant thing about my lifestyle is my stereo system, buying music and going to gigs.&quot;; He no longer plays in a rock band, but regularly plays music with friends and on his own,; and still writes songs.; Unlike many other famous actors who are also musicians, he does not plan to start another band: &quot;Even if I was good, the very notion of being an actor with a rock band on the side would mean I'd never be taken seriously.&quot;; Murphy is also a dedicated runner.;Odell, Michael. &quot;The Cult of Cillian&quot;, ''Elle UK'', March 2007.;

Though raised Catholic before turning agnostic in his teens, Murphy ultimately became an atheist after researching his role as a nuclear physicist/astronaut in the science fiction film ''Sunshine''.;Fulton, Rick. [http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_headline=danny-s-new-golden-boy--&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18831455&amp;siteid=66633-name_page.html &quot;Danny's New Golden Boy&quot;], ''The Daily Record'', 30 March 2007. Accessed 18 July 2007.; He is a longtime vegetarian, not due to any moral objection to the killing of animals, but because of qualms about unhealthy agribusiness practices.;Wallick, Lee. &quot;A, B, Cillian–Z&quot;, ''Wonderland'', April/May 2007.; Son-in-law to John J. McGuinness, a Teachta Dála|TD in the Irish parliament, Murphy participated in the 2007 Rock the Vote Ireland campaign targeting young voters for the general election.; He has also campaigned for the rights of the homeless with the organization Focus Ireland.;Cunningham, Grainne. &quot;Plea From ''Playboy'' Star Puts Problems of Young Homeless People Into the Spotlight&quot;, ''Irish Independent'', 24 February 2004.;
