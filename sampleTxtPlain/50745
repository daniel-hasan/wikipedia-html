Biography
=Early Life=
Simon was born in Newark, New Jersey to Jewish Hungarian parents: Belle (died in 2007), an English teacher, and Louis Simon (died in 1995), a bandleader and teacher. His family soon moved to Kew Gardens Hills, Queens in New York City, Simon's musical career began in Forest Hills High School when he and his friend Art Garfunkel began singing together as a duo, occasionally performing at school dances. Their idols were the Everly Brothers, whom they often emulated and/or imitated in their early recordings. Simon and Garfunkel were named &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry&quot; by their record company and it was under this name that the duo first had success. In 1957, they recorded the single &quot;Hey, Schoolgirl,&quot; on Big Records which reached forty-nine on the pop charts while they were still in their teens. 

After graduating from high school, Simon attended Queens College, while Garfunkel studied at Columbia University in Manhattan. Simon was a brother in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. Though Simon earned a degree in English literature, his real passion was rock and roll. Between 1957 and 1964, Simon wrote, recorded, and released more than thirty songs, occasionally reuniting with Garfunkel as Tom &amp; Jerry for some singles, including &quot;Our Song,&quot; &quot;That's My Story,&quot; and &quot;Surrender, Please Surrender,&quot; among others. He also briefly attended Brooklyn Law School.

Most of the songs Simon recorded in the six years after 1957 were performed alone or with musicians other than Garfunkel. They were released on several minor record labels, such as Amy, ABC-Paramount, Big, Hunt, Ember, King, Tribute, and Madison. He used several different pseudonyms for these recordings, including Jerry Landis, Paul Kane (from Orson Welles's film ''Citizen Kane''), and True Taylor. Simon enjoyed some moderate success in recording a few singles as part of a group called Tico and the Triumphs, including a song called &quot;Motorcycle&quot; which reached 99 on the ''Billboard'' charts in 1962.Tico and the Triumphs released four &quot;45s.&quot;Marty Cooper, a member of the group, sang lead on several of these releases and was actually known as Tico. Bobby Susser, children's songwriter and record producer, and childhood friend of Simon's, co-produced the Tico &quot;45s&quot; with Simon. That same year, Paul reached 97 on the pop charts as Jerry Landis with the hit &quot;The Lone Teen Ranger.&quot; Both singles were released on Amy Records. 

During this period, Simon met Carole King, with whom he recorded several unreleased demos as a duo called The Cosines to be recorded and released by other groups. In addition, Simon's experience in the studio led him to produce many singles for other acts, including The Vels, Ritchie Cordell, The Fashions, Jay Walker and the Pedestrians, and Dougie and the Dubs. It was also at this time that he became attracted to the New York folk music scene and made his first forays into the folk-rock genre, as is evident in the songs &quot;Carlos Dominguez&quot; and &quot;He Was My Brother&quot; (1963), the latter of which he dedicated to a friend and former classmate, Andrew Goodman who had been murdered while working on the Freedom Summer project in Mississippi in 1964. During the mid-1960s, while living in the UK, Simon co-wrote several songs with Bruce Woodley of the Australian pop group The Seekers. &quot;I Wish You Could Be Here,&quot; &quot;Cloudy,&quot; and &quot;Red Rubber Ball&quot; were written during this period. However, Woodley's co-authorship credit was incorrectly omitted from &quot;Cloudy&quot; off the ''Parsley, Sage, Rosemary &amp; Thyme'' album. When the American group The Cyrkle recorded a cover of &quot;Red Rubber Ball,&quot; the song reached number two in the US. Simon also contributed his original composition to The Seekers catalogue, &quot;Someday One Day,&quot; which was released in March 1966.

=Simon and Garfunkel=

In early 1964, Simon and Garfunkel got an audition with Columbia Records, whose executives were impressed enough to sign the duo to a contract to produce an album. According to a February 2001 writing from Bud Scoppa, Miles Davis was a member of the Columbia Records staff that offered the duo a record deal. Columbia decided that the two would be called simply &quot;Simon &amp; Garfunkel,&quot; which Simon claimed in 2003, was the first time that artists' ethnic names had been used in pop music.;Paul Simon, Speech given upon induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Cleveland, OH, 2003.;

Simon and Garfunkel's first LP, ''Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.'' was released on 19 October 1964 and comprised twelve songs in the folk vein, five of them written by Simon. The album initially flopped, but East Coast radio stations began receiving requests for one of the tracks, Simon's &quot;The Sound of Silence.&quot; Their producer, Tom Wilson, overdubbed the track with electric guitar, bass, and drums, releasing it as a single that eventually went to number one on the pop charts in the USA. 

Simon had gone to England after the initial failure of ''Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.'', pursuing a solo career (including collaborations with Bruce Woodley of The Seekers) and releasing the album ''The Paul Simon Song Book'' in the UK in 1965. But he returned to the USA to reunite with Garfunkel after &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; had started to enjoy commercial success. Together they recorded several influential albums, including 1966's ''Sounds of Silence'', ''Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme'', ''Bookends'' in 1968 and ''Bridge Over Troubled Water'' (1969). Simon and Garfunkel also contributed extensively to the soundtrack of the 1967 Mike Nichols film ''The Graduate'' (starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft). While writing ''Mrs. Robinson'', Simon originally toyed with the title ''Mrs. Roosevelt''. When Garfunkel reported this indecision over the song's name to the director, Nichols replied, &quot;Don't be ridiculous! We're making movie here! It's Mrs. Robinson!&quot;;David Fricke, in the leaflet accompaniement to the Simon and Garfunkel 1997 album &quot;Old Friends&quot;;

Simon pursued solo projects after the duo released their very popular album ''Bridge over Troubled Water.'' Occasionally, he and Garfunkel did reunite, such as in 1975 for their Top Ten single &quot;My Little Town,&quot; which Simon originally wrote for Garfunkel, claiming his work was lacking ‘bite’.Garfunkel insisted they sing the song together, and release it on their respective solo albums; Paul Simon's ''Still Crazy After All These Years,'' and Garfunkel's ''Breakaway.'' Contrary to popular belief, the song is not at all autobiographical of Simon's early life in New York.;&quot;The Boy in the Bubble&quot; by Patrick Humphries, page 96.; In 1981, they got together again for the famous concert in Central Park, followed by an aborted reunion album ''Think Too Much'', which was eventually released (sans Garfunkel) as ''Hearts and Bones''. Together, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.

In 2003, the two reunited again when they received Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. This reunion led to a U.S. tour, the acclaimed &quot;Old Friends&quot; concert series, followed by a 2004 international encore, which culminated in a free concert at the Colosseum in Rome. That final concert drew 600,000 people &amp;mdash; 100,000 more than had attended Paul McCartney's concert at the same venue a year earlier.

=Solo career=
The album that redefined Simon as a solo artist, 1986's ''Graceland''.
After Simon and Garfunkel split in 1971, Simon began to write and record solo material.He released ''Paul Simon'' in 1972, which contained one of his first experiments with world music, the Jamaican-inspired ''Mother and Child Reunion,'' and ''There Goes Rhymin' Simon'' in 1973, which featured such popular hit songs as &quot;Something So Right&quot; (a tribute to his first wife, Peggy), &quot;Kodachrome,&quot; &quot;American Tune,&quot; and &quot;Loves Me Like A Rock,&quot; the latter two obliquely referencing the dark cloud of the Watergate scandal involving the Nixon administration. His 1975 album ''Still Crazy After All These Years'' is considered to be among his finest work, particularly the title track and the hit single &quot;50 Ways to Leave Your Lover.&quot; Over the next five years, Simon dabbled in various projects, including writing music for the film ''Shampoo'' (a project which was eventually scrapped) and acting (he was cast as Tony Lacey in Woody Allen's film ''Annie Hall''). He continued, though less prolifically, to produce hits such as &quot;Slip Slidin' Away&quot; (on Simon's final Columbia album ''Greatest Hits, Etc.'' in 1977) and &quot;Late in the Evening,&quot; (on 1980's ''One Trick Pony'' album) while often appearing on ''Saturday Night Live''. The ''One Trick Pony'' album, Simon's first album with Warner Bros. Records (which also took over distribution of Simon's solo Columbia recordings from 1972 on) was also paired with a major motion picture of the same name, with Simon in the starring role. Simon's next album ''Hearts and Bones'', while critically acclaimed, did not yield any hit singles and marked a lull in his commercial popularity in the early 1980s. The album featured &quot;The Late Great Johnny Ace,&quot; his tribute partly to slain ex-Beatle John Lennon.

In 1985, Simon lent his talents to USA for Africa and performed on the famine relief fundraising single We Are the World. In 1986 he released the immensely popular ''Graceland'', for which he won a Grammy. The album featured the groundbreaking use of African rhythms and performers such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo. In 1990, he followed up ''Graceland'' with the commercially successful and consistent successor album ''The Rhythm of the Saints'', which featured Brazilian musical themes. These albums helped to popularize world music as a genre. The importance of both albums allowed Simon to stage another New York concert, and on August 15, 1991, almost 10 years after his concert with Garfunkel, Simon staged another concert in Central Park with both African and South American bands. The success led to both a live album and an Emmy winning TV special.

His 2000 studio album ''You're the One'', did not reach the commercial heights of previous albums but was considered by many fans and critics to be an artistic success and received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. A DVD of the same title, taped in Paris, was released in 2000. In 2002 he recorded the theme song for the animated children's movie ''The Wild Thornberrys Movie'' called &quot;Father and Daughter.&quot; It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song. 

Simon at the Olympia, Paris during the shooting of ''You're the One'' in concert.
Simon's latest album, ''Surprise'', produced by himself and Brian Eno (who was credited with &quot;sonic landscapes&quot;), was released on May 9, 2006. In commenting on US TV show ''Ellen'' what drove him to write material for this latest album, Simon noted the events of September 11, 2001 and also turning 60 since his previous album ''You're the One''. Simon toured the USA in early 2006, playing songs from ''Surprise'' as well as his classics. Towards the end of the year, he toured ''Surprise'' in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Simon is one of a small number of performers such as Johnny Rivers, Billy Joel, Pink Floyd (from 1975's ''Wish You Were Here'' onward), Queen, Genesis (though under the members' individual names and/or the pseudonym Gelring Limited) and Neil Diamond who have their name as the copyright owner on their recordings (most records have the recording company as the named owner of the recording).

=2004 reissues=
In 2004, Simon's record company announced the release of expanded editions of each of his solo albums, individually and together in a limited-edition nine-disc boxed set, ''Paul Simon: The Studio Recordings 1972&amp;ndash;2000''. The expanded individual albums feature a total of thirty bonus tracks, including original song demos, live recordings, duets, six never-before-released songs, and outtakes from each of his nine solo albums. And in 2007 Paul Simon teamed up with Wyclef Jean on Wyclefs CD The Carnival Vol:II Memoirs of an Immigrant on the Duet Fast car.

Simon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame a second time in 2000 for his achievements as a solo artist. (The first time was together with Art Garfunkel for their work as Simon and Garfunkel.)

=Music for Broadway=
In the late 1990s, he also wrote and produced a Broadway musical called ''The Capeman'', which lost $11 million during its 1998 run. Though the musical failed, the music itself is considered to be some of Simon's finest, and rumors persist that the show may be revived and go on national tour.

=Film and television=
Simon has also dabbled in acting. He played music producer Tony Lacey in the 1977 Woody Allen film ''Annie Hall'', and wrote and starred in 1980s ''One Trick Pony'' as Jonah Levin, a journeyman rock and roller. Paul Simon also appeared on ''The Muppet Show'' (the only episode to use only the songs of one songwriter, Simon).

Simon has also appeared on ''Saturday Night Live'' (SNL) either as host or musical guest for a total of 12 times. His most recent SNL appearance was on May 13 2006 (the host was Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who was [at the time], SNL's first female castmember to host an episode), when he appeared as musical guest and sang two new songs from his ''Surprise'' album, &quot;How Can You Live in the Northeast?&quot; and &quot;Outrageous.&quot; In one ''SNL'' skit from 1986 (when he was promoting ''Graceland''), Simon plays himself, waiting in line with a friend to get into a movie. He amazes his friend by remembering intricate details about prior meetings with passers-by, but draws a complete blank when approached by Art Garfunkel, despite the latter's numerous memory prompts.

Simon also appeared alongside with George Harrison as musical guest on the Thanksgiving Day episode of ''SNL'' ( November 20, 1976). The two performed &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; together, while Simon performed &quot;50 Ways to Leave Your Lover&quot; solo earlier in the show.

On September 29, 2001, Simon made a special appearance on the first ''SNL'' to air after the September 11, 2001 attacks. On that show, he performed &quot;The Boxer&quot; to the audience and the NYC firefighters and police officers. He is also friends with former ''SNL'' star Chevy Chase, who appeared in his video for &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot; lip synching the song while Simon looks disgruntled and mimes backing vocals and the playing of various instruments beside him. Chase performed the song with him again during his Concert in the Park in 1991. He is a close friend of SNL producer Lorne Michaels, who produced the 1977 TV show ''The Paul Simon Special'', as well as the Simon and Garfunkel concert in Central Park four years later. Simon and Lorne Michaels were the subjects of a 2006 episode of the Sundance channel documentary series, ''Iconoclasts.'' 

He has been the subject of two films by Jeremy Marre, the first on ''Graceland'', the second on ''The Capeman''.

=Personal life=
Simon has been married three times. He is currently married to singer-songwriter Edie Brickell.They were married May 30, 1992. They have three children -Adrian Edward (born December 1992), Lulu Belle (born April 1995) and Gabriel Elijah (born May 1998).

Simon's first marriage was to Peggy Harper; they were married in late autumn 1969. They had a son, Harper Simon, in 1972. They divorced in 1975. The song &quot;Train in the Distance,&quot; from Simon's 1983 album, is about this relationship. Simon's 1972 song &quot;Run That Body Down&quot;, from his debut solo album, casually mentions both himself and his then-wife (&quot;Peg&quot;) by name.

His second marriage was to actress and author Carrie Fisher to whom he proposed after a New York Yankees game. (the song Hearts and Bones was written about this relationship) They were married on August 16, 1983 but the marriage lasted only eleven months.

=Philanthropy=
Simon is a proponent of music education for children. In 2003, he signed on as an official supporter of Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization that provides free musical instruments and free lessons to children in public schools throughout the U.S.A. He sits on the organization's board of directors as an honorary member

Paul Simon is also a major benefactor and one of the founders of the Children's Health Project and Children's Health Fund [http://www.childrenshealthfund.org/] [http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/052597/mobile.htm] which started by creating specially equipped &quot;buses&quot; to take medical care to children in medically underserved areas, urban and rural. Their first bus was in the impoverished South Bronx of New York City but they now operate in 12 states, including the Gulf Coast.It has expanded greatly, partnering with major hospitals, local public schools and medical schools and advocating policy for children's health and medical care.

=Honors=
Paul Simon is a two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame — as a solo artist in 2001, and in 1990 as half of Simon and Garfunkel.

In 2002, Simon was one of the five annual recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors, the nation's highest tribute to performing and cultural artists. He received the award after Sir Paul McCartney, withdrew, citing &quot;personal considerations.&quot;

On March 1, 2007, Simon was announced as the recipient of the first annual Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, which he received on May 23, 2007. The award recognizes the profound and positive effect of popular music on the world’s culture. Upon being notified of receiving this honor, Simon said, “I am grateful to be the recipient of the Gershwin Prize and doubly honored to be the first. I look forward to spending an evening in the company of artists I admire at the award ceremony in May. I can think of a few who have expressed my words and music far better than I. I’m excited at the prospect of that happening again. It’s a songwriter’s dream come true.&quot;;[http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2007/07-010.html]; Simon was also reunited with Art Garfunkel for the occasion, when they performed &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water.&quot;

The Gershwin Prize event was nationally broadcast on PBS on June 27, 2007.;[http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2007/07-010.html];
