Dwarf tarantulas, also known as sheet funnel-web spiders are a type of spider from the family Mecicobothriidae.Dwarf tarantulas are one of several families of the sub-order Mygalomorphae; this larger group also includes the true tarantulas. 

Description
Dwarf tarantulas, as the name indicates, appear like other species of tarantula, but are physically much smaller.Many specimens are smaller than 1 cm in length, and the largest in the family are seldom larger than 2 cm.The spiders, like all Mygalomorphae, have downward pointing fangs; dwarf tarantulas also have long spinnerets.

Habitat and range
Many dwarf tarantulas make loose sheet webs around debris, living close to the soil in cracks or under rocks or other objects.It is expected that they have similar capturing techniques to funnel-web tarantulas.

All but two species of dwarf tarantula (''Mecicobothrium baccai'' and ''Mecicobothrium thorelli'') are native to North America, with most of them native to the United States.''Hexurella encina'' is native to Mexico, and ''M. thorelli'' is a South American species, found in Argentina and Uruguay

''Hexura picea'' and ''H. rothi'' are known to occur in the Pacific Northwest; ''Hexurella rupicola'' and ''Megahexura fulva'' are known to occur in California.''H. apachea'' and ''H. pinea'' are found in Arizona.
