Copper(I) chloride (quite commonly called cuprous chloride), is the lower chloride of copper, with the formula CuCl.It occurs naturally as the mineral nantokite.This colorless solidis almost insoluble in water, and which tends to oxidize in air to green CuCl;2;.It is a Lewis acid which reacts with suitable ligands such as ammonia or chloride ion to form complexes, many of which are water-soluble.It is even able to form a stable complex with carbon monoxide in the presence of aluminum chloride as in the COPure;SM; process.

In aqueous solution, CuCl would be unstable with respect to disproportionation into Cu and CuCl;2;, but is stable toward water due to its low solubility.;Greenwood, N.N.; Earnshaw, A. ''Chemistry of the Elements'', 2nd ed., Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, UK, 1997.;

Chemical properties
Copper(I) chloride is a Lewis acid, classified as soft according to the Hard-Soft Acid-Base concept. Thus, it tends to form stable complexes with soft Lewis bases such as triphenylphosphine:
:CuCl+PPh;3;→[CuCl(PPh;3;)];4; (Ph = phenyl)

Although CuCl is insoluble in water, it dissolves in aqueous solutions containing suitable donor molecules.It readily forms complexes with halide ions, for example forming H;3;O;+; CuCl;2;;-; with concentrated hydrochloric acid.It also dissolves readily in solutions containing CN;-;, S;2;O;3;;2-; or NH;3;.

Solutions of CuCl in HCl or NH;3; absorb carbon monoxide to form colourless complexes such as the crystalline halogen-bridged dimer [CuCl(CO)];2;.The same HCl solution can also react with acetylene gas to form [CuCl(C;2;H;2;)], while an NH;3; solution of CuCl forms an explosive copper(I) acetylide with acetylene.Complexes of CuCl with alkenes can be made by reduction of CuCl;2; by sulfur dioxide in the presence of the alkene in alcohol solution.Complexes with chelating alkenes such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene are particularly stable:;Nicholls, D. ''Compleses and First-Row Transition Elements'', Macmillan Press, London, 1973.;

Structure of COD complex of CuCl

CuCl reacts with organometallic compounds such as methyllithium (CH;3;Li) to form &quot;Gilman reagents&quot; such as (CH;3;);2;CuLi, which find extensive use in organic synthesis.Grignard reagents react similarly.

Preparation
Copper(I) chloride may be prepared by the reduction of copper(II) salts such as CuSO;4; using sulfur dioxide or copper metal.;Keller, R. N.; Wycoff, H. D. &quot;Copper(I) chloride&quot; Inorganic Syntheses 1946; Volume II, p 1-4.;
:2 CuBr;2;+H;2;O+SO;3;;2-;→2 CuBr+SO;4;;2-;+2 HBr

SO;2; may be prepared ''in situ'' from sodium bisulfite (NaHSO;3;) or sodium metabisulfite (Na;2;S;2;O;5;) and acid. The reduction is carried out in hydrochloric acid, and the resulting CuCl;2;;-; complex is diluted to precipitate white CuCl (by driving the equilibrium using Le Chatelier's principle).

(1)NaHSO;3;(aq)+ HCl (aq)→SO;2;(aq)+NaCl+H;2;O(l)

(2)2 CuSO;4;(aq)+SO;2;(aq)+2 H;2;O(l)+4 HCl(aq)→2 HCuCl;2;(aq)+3 H;2;SO;4;(aq)

(3)HCuCl;2;(aq)+ H;2;O(l)→CuCl(s)+H;3;O;+;(aq)+Cl;-;(aq)

Uses
A major chemical use for copper(I) chloride is as a catalyst for a variety of organic reactions.Compared to other &quot;soft&quot; Lewis acids, it is much more affordable than non-toxic silver(I) chloride and palladium(II) chloride, and much less toxic than lead(II) chloride and mercury(II) chloride.In addition, it can undergo redox chemistry via copper(II) or copper(III) intermediates.This combination of properties make copper(I) salts invaluable reagents.

One such application is in the Sandmeyer reaction.;(a) Wade, L. G. ''Organic Chemistry'', 5th ed., p. 871, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle RIver, New Jersey, 2003.(b) March, J. ''Advanced Organic Chemistry'', 4th ed., p. 723, Wiley, New York, 1992.; Treatment of an arenediazonium salt with CuCl leads to an aryl chloride, for example:

(Example Sandmeyer reaction using CuCl)

The reaction has wide scope, and usually gives good yields.

The observation that copper(I) halides catalyse 1,4-addition of Grignard reagents to alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones;Kharasch, M. S.; Tawney, P. O. ''Journal of the American Chemical Society'', 63, 2308 (1941).; led to the development of organocuprate reagents that are widely used today in organic synthesis:;Jasrzebski, J. T. B. H.; van Koten, G. in ''Modern Organocopper Chemistry'', (N. Krause, ed.), p. 1, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002.;

(Addition of RMgX to C=C-C=O mediated by CuCl)

Although other copper(I) compounds such as copper(I) iodide are now more often used for this type of reaction, there are cases where copper(I) chloride is particularly effective:;(a) Bertz, S. H.; Fairchild, E. H. in ''Handbook of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volume 1: Reagents, Auxiliaries and Catalysts for C-C Bond Formation'', (R. M. Coates, S. E. Denmark, eds.), pp. 220-3, Wiley, New York, 1999.(b) Munch-Petersen, J., et al., ''Acta Chimica Scand.'', 15, 277 (1961).;

(Alkylation of sorbate ester at 4-position mediated by CuCl)

Here, Bu indicates an n-butyl group.Without CuCl, the Grignard reagent alonegives a mixture of 1,2 and 1,4-addition products (i.e., the butyl adds at the closer to the C=O).

Copper(I) chloride is also an intermediate formed from copper(II) chloride in the Wacker process.

CuCl is used as a catalyst in Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP).

Precautions
Copper salts do have some toxicity and should be handled with care; wear gloves and goggles.Avoid bringing CuCl into contact with alkynes.;Wells, A. F. ''Structural Inorganic Chemistry'', 5th ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK, 1984.;
