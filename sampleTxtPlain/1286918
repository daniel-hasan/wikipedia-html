Interstate 295 (abbreviated I-295) in New Jersey and Delaware is a bypass route from a junction with Interstate 95 south of Wilmington, Delaware to another junction with I-95 north of Trenton, New Jersey. The route runs parallel with the New Jersey Turnpike for most of its course.

Interstate 295 is an auxiliary Interstate Highway, designated as a bypass around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Interstate 95 serves the city directly, connecting it with Wilmington and Trenton, whereas I-295 bypasses the city running east of the Delaware River.Interstate 95 was originally supposed to continue northeast from the routes' junction near Trenton on the proposed Somerset Freeway, but this plan was cancelled, limiting I-295's capability as a true bypass between Baltimore and New York City.

Today, traffic on Interstate 295 is directed to take Interstate 195 (or surface street connections further south) to the New Jersey Turnpike to reach New York City.The same route is prescribed for traffic on I-95 in Pennsylvania and near Trenton to bridge the gap with I-95 further north.

I-295 begins at a complex interchange with I-95, I-495, and Delaware Route 141 in New Castle, Delaware. From there, it runs for about three miles east, then crosses the Delaware River via the Delaware Memorial Bridge, which is actually two twin suspension bridges carrying traffic in opposite directions.One bridge carries traffic from Delaware to New Jersey, while the other span carries traffic from New Jersey to Delaware. At the New Jersey approaches of the toll bridge, a connection is provided with the south end of the New Jersey Turnpike. The Delaware Memorial Bridge is the only toll portion of the highway, and only about three miles of the entire route of I-295 lie in Delaware.

For its entire route (excluding the portion north of I-195 near Trenton and its route in Delaware), I-295 closely parallels both the New Jersey Turnpike and U.S. Route 130; sometimes the turnpike is visible from I-295.In the region, I-295 serves as a local complement to the Turnpike, due to the slower design speed and the Turnpike's relatively few interchanges in the area.Interstate 195 is the only expressway connection between the two routes besides their junction near the Delaware Memorial Bridge, as I-295 has no interchange with the Turnpike's Pennsylvania Turnpike Connector (now called the &quot;Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension&quot;), and the Turnpike has no interchange with Route 42 (the North-South Freeway). This way, I-295 serves as a route to access the South Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia, while the Turnpike provides an &quot;express&quot; route from Wilmington to Trenton. right |thumb|245px| I-295 runs north through Camden up towards Trenton (crossing I-195), and ends at I-95(M)/U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|US 1 north of Trenton.
South of the interchange with Interstate 76 and Route 42, 9.32 miles (15.00 km) of I-295 (between exit 13 and exit 23) is concurrent with U.S. Route 130, and was in fact built as part of US 130 before the Interstate Highway System was created.The interchange with I-76 (exit 26) is a semi-directional T, and the nearby junction with Route 42 is a single Y, with through traffic on I-295 northbound forced to merge and re-exit from Route 42/I-76. Due to the complex interchange design and resulting weaving, the speed limit on I-295 through the area is 35&amp;nbsp;mph.

North of Camden, I-295 continues north, paralleling the New Jersey Turnpike. At around exit 57A in Bordentown, I-295 takes a slight westerly turn away from the New Jersey Turnpike and continues its run towards Trenton. Also, north of exit 57A, I-295 becomes less rural and passes through a more open area where more buildings and a farther distance could be seen from the freeway, a sign that I-295 is leaving the Delaware Valley area and entering the New York metropolitan area. Upon reaching its interchange with Interstate 195 (one of the last portions of the freeway to be completed), it no longer parallels with the New Jersey Turnpike, and runs along the eastern side of Trenton, where I-295 ends at US 1, and then (I-95) starts to circle around Trenton.At Exit 67 with U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 1 in Lawrence Township, NJ, Interstate 295 formally ends and becomes Interstate 95 south to Pennsylvania.Interstate 295 originally continued approximately five miles beyond this point to a proposed interchange with the Somerset Freeway near Interstate 95's current exit with Route 31.;;;;Had the Somerset Freeway been completed, Interstate 295 would have ended here at a completed Interstate 95 between Philadelphia and New York City.When the Somerset Freeway was cancelled, Interstate 95 was extended and Interstate 295 was truncated to their current termini at US 1. The portion running through New Jersey is sometimes called the Camden Freeway.;;

History
Northbound view of I-295 in Hamilton, New Jersey
Portions of what is now Interstate 295 were planned as early as the 1940s as a bypass replacement for U.S. Route 130 in southern New Jersey, as well as the Route 39 beltway around Trenton.The first section of the US 130 bypass in Gloucester County (between current exits 21 and 24) opened in 1948, with a second section (between exits 14 and 21) opening in 1954.;;Both these sections were originally signed only as US 130, but became a part of I-295 when the Interstate Highway System was created in 1958.

Also among the earliest portions of I-295 to be built are the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the Delaware approach.When the bridge opened on August 16, 1951, so did the eastern two miles of I-295 in Delaware, between U.S. Route 13 and the bridge.The bridge was signed as a portion of U.S. Route 40, and also became a part of I-295 in 1958.The western section from US 13 to I-95 opened with the completion of the Delaware Turnpike in 1963, which – when combined with the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, Harbor Tunnel Thruway, JFK Memorial Highway, and New Jersey Turnpike – completed a nonstop freeway between Washington, D.C., and New York City.;;

The remainder of Interstate 295 through New Jersey was planned as Federal Aid Interstate Route 108, which was created by the New Jersey Department of Transportation in 1956;; when the Interstate Highways System was being planned but not yet numbered.Interstate 295 was mostly complete (especially south of Trenton) by the 1980s; the last portion to be completed was around the Interstate 195/Route 29 interchange in 1994.

The 295 expressway originally had extended further north (along the current I-95M) and ended at the (now) &quot;ghost&quot; interchange (where the Somerset Freeway would've intersected) at 95M's Mile marker 5.0 in Hopewell Township. The 295 expressway continued for an extra 4 miles (thereby making its NJ length about 72 miles), which then changed the exit numbers for: ''Princeton Pike'' (95M Exit 8/295 Exit 68), U.S. Route 206|US 206 (95M Exit 7/295 Exit 69), and ''Federal City Road'' (95M Exit 5/295 Exit 71). Even after the Somerset Freeway was terminated, 295 still continued north; it wasn't until 1993 that the NJDOT shortened the NJ length of 295 from 72 miles to 68 miles, and extended the 95M designation along 295's former 4-mile stretch (to the exit for U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|US 1).

Since Interstate 95M ends at the junction with Interstate 295 and US Route 1, the NJDOT installed signs that direct motorists to the &quot;official&quot; part of Interstate 95. At 295's Exit 67, there are signs that state the beginning of the 295 expressway which will lead to Interstate 95/New Jersey Turnpike. This signage continues south for approximately 7 miles and then directs motorists to exit 295 at Exit 60 for Interstate 195 east (towards I-95/New Jersey Turnpike). Motorists then must travel on 195 for approximately 6 miles to (the continuation of) Interstate 95 (New Jersey Turnpike).
;

The expressway, like many others in New Jersey, once had solar powered emergency call boxes every 1.0 mile, however with the advent of cell phones the usage of these call boxes became extremely limited.To save on maintenance costs, the NJDOT removed these call boxes in 2005.Due to difficulty replacing parts, the call boxes are disappearing from many other highways as well, such as I-195, I-280, I-78, I-80, NJ 55, and NJ 208.;;;;

Future
The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) is currently planning to reconstruct the interchange with Interstate 76 and Route 42 south of Camden.The project is necessary to create a direct through connection for I-295 through the interchange, eliminate weaving between I-295 and I-76, and to fill in the missing movements between I-295 and Route 42 south of the interchange.;;There were several alternatives proposed for the interchange design, which were then shortlisted to five.A final preferred alternative will be selected sometime earlyin 2007.;;All of the shortlisted alternatives provide a direct connection for I-295 through the interchange without using the present substandard ramps, and also provide new connections from Route 42 northbound to I-295 southbound and from I-295 northbound to Route 42 southbound.

The northern portion of Interstate 295 will be affected by the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project in Bristol, Pennsylvania. With the completion of the project, Interstate 95 will be redesignated along the Pennsylvania Turnpike to connect with the New Jersey Turnpike (currently the northern section of I-95) at exit 6, and the I-95 designation will be removed from the section north of the interchange in Pennsylvania. Under the original plan, I-295 would have been extended past its current terminus at U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|US 1 along current I-95, across the Scudder Falls Bridge, and into Pennsylvania to the new interchange.;[http://www.paturnpikei95.com/pdf/ROD_figA.pdf Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission I-95/I-276 Interchange Project Final Environmental Impact Statement - Appendix A: Alternative Map];;;

However, in September 2005, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania came to an agreement that, instead, Interstate 195 would be extended along this section of I-95.;[http://www.paturnpikei95.com/pdf/DACMeeting050914.pdf Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission I-95/I-276 Interchange Project Meeting Design Management Summary - DRAFT: Design Advisory Committee Meeting #2]; This means that the extended I-195 would replace the portion of I-95 between the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania, and U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 1 in Lawrence Township, New Jersey.It would also replace Interstate 295 north of exit 60 in Hamilton Township, New Jersey (its exit with I-195), truncating I-295 at that junction.This option would reduce the confusion of having I-295 parallel itself in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.;; This proposal is waiting for approval by AASHTO.
