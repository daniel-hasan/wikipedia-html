Iranian rock (موسیقی راک ایرانی) is a form of rock music that is largely produced in Europe and Tehran's underground circles, and is rising to challenge &quot;Tehrangeles pop&quot;, which has dominated the popular music genre of Iran for decades. 

Iranian rock is almost entirely in Persian language. There are however musicians of Iranian descent both inside and outside Iran that produce their rock music in languages such as English or German. One example is ''Dario Amini'' whose hit &quot;[http://dariomuse.com/music/artist%20-%20Track%2010.MP3 Just 4 today]&quot; was frequently heard on Iranian rock radiostations in 2006.

Iranian rock has its roots in American rock, British rock and German rock, but has its own distinctive elements mixed in to create a homegrown class of sounds and melodies, whether progressive, hard, or Persian heavy metal.

History
Rock music in Iran has its beginnings in the 1970s with musicians such as Kourosh Yaghmaei. The 1979 revolution of Iran however did not allow this musical genre to survive long though, as Iran was transformed into an Islamic state. During the 1980s hence, the production of indigenous rock music was largely silent in Iran and merely limited to private homes.

During the late 1990s however when president Mohammad Khatami advocated a more open cultural atmosphere in his domestic policies, Iran came to witness a unique blossoming of an indigenous breed of rock and hard rock musicians. The growth has been an explosive trend that continues until this day. What separates this movement from its Tehrangeles pop counterpart is the young age group and the fact that it is almost entirely homegrown, and mostly underground.;Asharq Al-Awsat: &quot;Iran's Underground Music Revolution&quot;.

One of the first rock concerts ever to take place was that of an anonymous but highly acclaimed band in Tehran's underground scene;The Iranian, Link: [http://www.iranian.com/Music/2002/June/Rock/index.html]; called &quot;Pezhvak&quot;.

The contemporary scene

Within a few years after the launch of Tehran's underground scene in the late nineties, some bands started superimposing the poetry of Persian literature such as Hafez in their lyrics on top of classical western rock tunes and melodies, and peppered with sounds of traditional Persian music.;Tehran Avenue: Link: [http://www.tehranavenue.com/article.php?id=174]; [http://www.o-hum.com/media/audio/hil/The%20Way%20of%20Love.mp3 (mp3 sample)]

Among the pioneers of this movement, the rock band O-Hum was first permitted to play in freely mixed sex concerts for Christian minorities in Tehran.;[http://www.o-hum.com/photos.htm]; Today, there are [http://tehran360.com/main.php?page_name=articles&amp;article_id=1&amp;&amp;PHPSESSID=70291a5d0e9c48878ac7713d8c1f854e underground competitions] and [http://www.tehranavenue.com/article.php?id=605 music critics] writing of these bands. And once in a while, the government allows rock concerts to take place in very limited conditions.;The Iranian.

And for a country like Iran that heavily restricted all forms of modern western music as late as the early 1990s, it is still surprising to hear bands today in Iran producing rock music with female vocals thrown in, or even heavy metal music.;[http://www.tehranavenue.com/article.php?id=177];

In today's Iran, one can see books printed in Persian about Queen, Guns N' Roses and Pink Floyd in front of the Tehran University in the ''book bazaar''s. There are also state-sanctioned albums with selected works of The Beatles, Joe Satriani, Santana, The Gypsy Kings, Al Di Meola, Steve Vai, and Era, among many others.
