Selena attained further notability in North America after Yolanda Saldívar, the president of her fan club, murdered her at the age of 23. On April 12 1995, two weeks after her death, George W.

The album was not sold in stores, and her father bought all the original copies. It was later re-released in 1995 under the title ''Mis Primeras Grabaciones''.Selena did well in school, but as she grew more popular, the travel demands of her performance schedule began to interfere with her education. Her father pulled her out of school altogether when she was in eighth grade.; She continued her education on the road; at age seventeen she earned a high school diploma from The American School of Correspondence in Chicago. Selena released her second album, ''Alpha'', in 1986.

Successes






At the Tejano Music Awards in 1987, Selena took the award for Best Female Vocalist (and would continue to dominate the Award for the next seven years).;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/16/earlyshow/leisure/music/main525834.shtml &quot;Fans, Family Remember Selena&quot;.] CBSNews.com, October 17 2002.

In 1988, Selena met Chris Perez, who had his own band. Two years later, the Quintanilla family hired him to play in Selena's band and they quickly fell in love. At first her father did not approve of the relationship between Perez and Selena, and went as far as firing Perez from the band. He eventually came to accept the relationship, telling Selena that Perez could come back only if they married and moved next door to the family home.;Patoski, Joe Nick.

This recording was the first Tejano album recorded by a female artist to achieve gold status.
