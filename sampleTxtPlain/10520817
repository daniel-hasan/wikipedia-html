''King Street'' follows the path of an old Indian Trail and was named after King George III. ;;

In 1815, George Hamilton, a settler and local politician, established a town site in the northern portion ''Barton Township'' after the war in 1815. He kept several east-west roads which were originally Indian trails, but the north-south streets were on a regular grid pattern. Streets were designated &quot;East&quot; or &quot;West&quot; if they crossed James Street or ''Highway 6''. Streets were designated &quot;North&quot; or &quot;South&quot; if they crossed ''King Street'' or ''Highway 8''. ;;
