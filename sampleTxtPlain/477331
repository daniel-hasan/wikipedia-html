The United States ten-dollar bill ($10) is a denomination of United States currency.U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton is currently featured on the obverse of the bill, while the U.S. Treasury is featured on the reverse. (Hamilton is one of two non-presidents featured on currently issued U.S. bills. The other is Benjamin Franklin, on the United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bill.) All $10 bills issued today are Federal Reserve Notes.

The Bureau of Engraving and Printing says the &quot;average life&quot; of a $10 bill in circulation is 18 months before it is replaced due to wear. Approximately 11% of all newly printed US banknotes are $10 bills.Ten dollar bills are delivered by Federal Reserve Banks in yellow straps.

The source of the face on the $10 bill is John Trumbull’s 1805 portrait of Hamilton that belongs to the portrait collection of New York City Hall.The $10 bill is the only U.S. paper currency in circulation in which the portrait faces to the left (the $100,000 bill features a portrait of Woodrow Wilson facing to the left, but it is no longer in circulation).

The $10 bill was issued as a Federal Reserve Note with a green seal and serial numbers and as a Gold Certificate with a golden seal and serial numbers.Contrary to popular belief, the car parked outside of the Treasury Department building is not a Ford Model T, but rather a composite of multiple cars of that era.
