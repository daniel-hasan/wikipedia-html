This is a comprehensive discography for Nation of Ulysses, a Washington, D.C.-based band formed in 1988, consisting of Ian Svenonius, James Canty, Steve Gamboa, Steve Kroner, and Tim Green.;;During the Nation of Ulysses' four years of activity, they released only two full-length albums: ''13-Point Program to Destroy America'' in 1991 and ''Plays Pretty for Baby'' in 1992, both released on Dischord Records. After releasing ''Plays Pretty for Baby'', the band began recording a third full-length album, but Steve Kroner separated from the band before recording was completed.The remaining quartet continued to record, but the group eventually dissolved before the record's completion.In 2000, six songs from those sessions, in addition to four new tracks recorded live, were compiled and released posthumously as ''The Embassy Tapes''.;;

In addition to their three-full length albums, the Nation of Ulysses released two nearly identical vinyl EPs.The first, a self-titled EP, was the band's first official release, but went out of print when the three tracks from it were included in ''13-Point Program to Destroy America''.The same three tracks were again released in 1992 under the title ''The Birth of the Ulysses Aesthetic (the synthesis of speed and transformation)''.;;The band were also featured in a number of compilation albums on a variety of record labels, all of which were released after the band had dissolved.;
