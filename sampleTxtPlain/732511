Harisu (Hangul: 하리수; Chinese: 河莉秀) is the stage name of Lee Kyung-eun (born Lee Kyung-yup, February 17, 1975), a transsexual pop singer, model and actress from South Korea. Despite being born male, she identified as female from early childhood, and underwent Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female|sex reassignment surgery in the 1990s. She is noted for being South Korea's first transgender entertainer, and in 2002 became only the second person in Korea to legally change their gender. Her stage name is an adaptation of the English phrase &quot;hot issue&quot;.

Harisu first gained public attention in 2001, after appearing in a television commercial for DoDo cosmetics. The commercial was a big success and ended up launching her career, allowing her to branch out into other fields such as music and acting. So far she has recorded five Korean musical albums, switching genres between techno and Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B, and her overseas releases have featured songs recorded in Mandarin. Her first major acting role was in the 2001 film ''Yellow Hair 2'', and since then her credits have included ''Hi! Honey'', a Taiwanese drama series, and ''Colour Blossoms'', an erotic drama by Hong Kong filmmaker Yonfan.

On May 19, 2007, Harisu married boyfriend Micky Jung, whom she had been dating for two years previously.

Career
= Debut=
Harisu first gained public attention when she appeared in this TV commercial for DoDo cosmetics. Note the Adam's apple, which was added digitally.
Harisu made her acting debut in 1991—while still a boy—as a supporting actor in a high school TV drama series,; and this was followed by other minor film and TV roles as an extra during the 1990s.;

Her big break came in early 2001, when she appeared in a TV commercial for DoDo cosmetics. The commercial hinted at the fact she is a transsexual, zooming in to reveal her Adam's apple (although this was added digitally, since Harisu herself does not have a prominent Adam's apple).;; DoDo were initially cautious about using the commercial, and had been prepared to withdraw it if the response was negative, but it turned out to be a big success and quickly established her as a celebrity. As South Korea's first transgender entertainer, there was a great deal of media interest in Harisu, and she was routinely described as being &quot;more beautiful than a woman&quot;.;; Explaining her reasons for &quot;coming out&quot;, she said, &quot;I don't want to face people dishonestly. I won't be able to hide it after all. It's better to make it clear from the start.&quot;;Park Soo-in, [http://search.hankooki.com/times/times_view.php?term=harisu+harisu++&amp;path=hankooki1/kt_culture/200106/t2001062817032846110.htm&amp;media=kt &quot;Harisu Redefines Gender Identity&quot;], ''The Korea Times'', June 28, 2001. Retrieved on May 6, 2007.; In June 2001, Harisu was the subject of a television documentary produced by KBS, which covered her childhood, family relationships, and debut as an entertainer.;

Later that year she was cast in the film ''Yellow Hair 2'', her first leading role. In addition to contributing songs for the films soundtrack, Harisu played a transsexual who goes on the run after the apparent death of a convenience store owner. Regarding her decision to appear in the film, she said, &quot;I wanted to break the stereotype of transsexuals — the demureness and extreme weakness with which they are often portrayed.&quot;; The film was released on July 21.

Also in 2001, Harisu published her autobiography, ''Eve from Adam'', and appeared in a music video for dance group Turbo. In September, she entered the K-pop music scene with her debut album, ''Temptation'', a mix of techno-style pop music and slow ballads, which peaked at number 32 on the MIAK (Music Industry Association of Korea) K-pop albums chart.; She released her second album, ''Liar'', in October 2002, describing it as &quot;a high-energy dance record with a very upbeat rhythm.&quot;; ''Liar'' became her biggest domestic chart success, reaching number 23 in its first month of release.;

In October 2003, Harisu made the decision to leave her management company, TTM Entertainment. However, TTM claimed to hold the rights to her stage name, and announced their intentions to use that name to promote other artists.; The matter was taken to court, and in early 2004 the ruling went in favour of Harisu, allowing her to keep the name. She subsequently set up her own company, G&amp;F Entertainment, in order to make her own decisions regarding her career.;Krista Kim, &quot;Harisu: Woman Revealed&quot;, ''The Korea Herald'', February 11, 2004.

In 2004, Harisu began to develop her career overseas, expressing frustration at being &quot;pigeon-holed&quot; as a transsexual in Korea. She starred in the Taiwanese drama series ''Hi! Honey'' alongside local celebrity Pace Wu, despite not being fluent in Mandarin (her lines were spoken in Korean and later dubbed).; She drew attention by promoting sanitary napkins in a series of advertisements for Taiwanese company UFT, for which she was paid an estimated ₩100 million per ad. Although she had been initially reluctant to take on the project, observers hailed the casting of a transwoman in such a campaign as a sign of progress.;Hwang Su-cheol, [http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200404/200404130027.html &quot;Transgender Singer to Do Menstrual Pad Ads&quot;], ''Digital Chosunilbo'', April 13, 2004.
