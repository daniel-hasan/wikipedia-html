Tamil ( ; ) is a Dravidian language spoken predominantly by Tamils in India, Sri Lanka and Singapore and smaller communities of speakers in many other countries.It is the official language of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, Languages of India#Classical languages of India|classical language in India, and has official status in India , Sri Lanka and Singapore.With more than 77 million speakers, Tamil is one of the widely spoken languages in the world.

Tamil has a literary tradition of over two thousand years.;; The earliest epigraphic records found date to around 300 BC and the Tolkāppiyam (தொல்காப்பியம்), oldest known treatise in Tamil, has been dated variously between second century BC and tenth century AD.;Herman Tieken(2001) ''Kavya in South India: Old Tamil Cankam Poetry''.

Tamil employs agglutinative grammar, where suffixes are used to mark noun class, number, and case, verb tense and other grammatical categories. Unlike other Dravidian languages, the metalanguage of Tamil, the language used to describe the technical linguistic terms of the language and its structure, is also Tamil (rather than Sanskrit).;;;A.K.

History

Palm-Leaf manuscripts in Tamil describing Indigenous medicine
Tamil is one of the ancient languages of the world with a 2200 year history.;;;;; The origins of Tamil are not transparent, but it developed and flourished in India as an independent language with a rich literature.;;;Caldwell, Robert; More than 55% of the epigraphical inscriptions, about 55,000, found by the Archaeological Survey of India in India are in Tamil language;; Unlike the neighbouring Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh where early inscriptions were written in Sanskrit, the early inscriptions in Tamil Nadu used Tamil exclusively.;; Tamil has the oldest extant literature amongst the Dravidian languages, but dating the language and the literature precisely is difficult. Literary works in India were preserved either in palm leaf manuscripts (implying repeated copying and recopying) or through oral transmission, making direct dating impossible.;Dating of Indian literature is largely based on relative dating relying on internal evidences with a few anchors. I. Mahadevan’s dating of Pukalur inscription proves some of the Sangam verses. See George L. Hart, &quot;Poems of Ancient Tamil, University of Berkeley Press, 1975, p.7-8 ; External chronological records and internal linguistic evidence, however, indicate that the oldest extant works were probably compiled sometime between the 2nd century BC and the 10th century AD.;George Hart, &quot;Some Related Literary Conventions in Tamil and Indo-Aryan and Their Significance&quot; ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', 94:2 (Apr - Jun 1974), pp. 157-167.;;Kamil Veith Zvelebil, ''Companion Studies to the History of Tamil Literature'', pp12;;

Epigraphic attestation of Tamil begins with rock inscriptions from the 2nd century BC, written in Tamil-Brahmi, an adapted form of the Brahmi script.;;;Iravatham Mahadevan (2003). Early Tamil Epigraphy from the Earliest Times to the Sixth Century A.D. Cambridge, Harvard University Press.; The earliest extant literary text is the Tolkāppiyam, a work on poetics and grammar which describes the language of the classical period, dated variously between the 1st BC and tenth AD. 

Tamil scholars categorise the Tamil literature and language into the following periods:;;
#Sangam (100 BC to 300 AD)
#Post-Sangam period (300 to 600 CE)
#Bhakthi period (600 to 1200 CE)
#Mediaeval Period (1200 to 1800 CE)
#Modern (1800 to the present)

The Sangam literature contains about 50,000 lines of poetry contained in 2381 poems attributed to 473 poets including many women poets.;Rajam, V.

Retrieved on 2007-08-16; During the post-Sangam period, important works like Thirukkural, and epic poems like Silappatikaram, Manimekalai, ''Sīvakacintāmani'' were composed. The Bhakthi period is known for the great outpouring of devotional songs set to pann music. Of those 9,295 Tevaram songs on Saivism and 4,000 songs on Vaishnavism are well known.;P.Ramanatha Pillai (Ed), Panniru thirumuraip perunthirattu (Tamil), Saiva Siddhanta Publishers, Chennai, 1961 p.3-4; The early mediaeval Period gave rise to one of thebest known adaptations of the Ramayana in Tamil, known as Kamba Ramayanam and a story of 63 Nayanmars known as Periyapuranam.

Origin and development
Tamil belongs to the southern branch of the Dravidian languages.It is sometimes classified as being part of a Tamil language family, which alongside Tamil proper, also includes the languages of about 35 ethno-linguistic groups;Prof. A.K. Perumal, Manorama Yearbook (Tamil) 2005 pp.302-318 ; such as the Irula, and Yerukula languages (see SIL Ethnologue).This group is a subgroup of the Tamil-Malayalam languages, which falls under a subgroup of the Tamil-Kodagu languages, which in turn is a subgroup of the Tamil-Kannada languages.The closest major relative of Tamil is Malayalam which is explained by the fact that until about the ninth century, Tamil and Malayalam were dialects of one language,;; called &quot;Tamil&quot; by the speakers of both.;;Although many of the differences between Tamil and Malayalam evidence a pre-historic split between eastern and western dialects,;

; the process of separation of the two into distinct languages was not completed until sometime in the 13th or 14th century.;;

The origins and initial development of Tamil is similar to that of the other Dravidian languages and independent of Sanskrit.;;See Vaidyanathan’s analysis of an early medieval text in S. Vaidyanathan, &quot;Indo-Aryan loan words in the Civakacintamani&quot; ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' 87:4. (Oct - Dec 1967), pp. 430-434.; During later centuries, however, Tamil, along with other Dravidian languages like Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam etc., has been greatly influenced by Sanskrit in terms of vocabulary, grammar and literary styles.;&quot;Literature in all Dravidian languages owes a great deal to Sanskrit, the magic wand whose touch raised each of the languages from a level of patois to that of a literary idiom&quot; (Sastri 1955, p309);;Caldwell, Robert. 1974.

Kāvya in South India: old Tamil Caṅkam poetry. Groningen: Egbert Forsten.;;Vaiyapuri Pillai in Takahashi, Takanobu. 1995, p18; A number of Sanskrit loan words were also absorbed by Tamil during this period, reflecting the increased trend of Sanskritisation in the Tamil country.;Sheldon Pollock, &quot;The Sanskrit Cosmopolis 300-1300: Transculturation, vernacularisation and the question of ideology&quot; in Jan E.M. Houben (ed.), ''The ideology and status of Sanskrit: Contributions to the history of the Sanskrit language'' (E.J. Brill, Leiden: 1996) at pp. 209-217.;; A number of authors of the late mediaeval period tried to resist this trend,;''See'' Ramaswamy’s analysis of one such text, the ''Tamil viṭututu'', in Sumathi Ramaswamy, &quot;Language of the People in the World of Gods: Ideologies of Tamil before the Nation&quot; ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', 57:1. (Feb. 1998), pp. 66-92.; culminating in the puristic movement of the 20th century, led byParithimaar Kalaignar and Maraimalai Adigal, which sought to remove the accumulated influence of Sanskrit on Tamil. This movement was called ''taṉit tamiḻ iyakkam'' (meaning ''pure Tamil movement'').;Dr. M. Varadarajan, A History of Tamil Literature, (Translated from Tamil by E.Sa. Viswanathan), Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, 1988- p.12 &quot;Since then the movement has been popularly known as the ''tanittamil iyakkam'' or the Pure Tamil movement among the Tamil scholars.&quot;; As a result of this, Tamil in formal documents, public speeches and scientific discourses is largely free of Sanskrit loan words;
; and it is estimated that the number of Sanskrit loan words in Tamil may actually have comedown from about 50% to 20%.;;

Geographic distribution
Distribution of Tamil speakers in South India and Sri Lanka (1961).
Tamil is the first language of the majority in Tamil Nadu, India and North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka. The language is spoken by small groups of minorities in other parts of these two countries such as Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra in case of India and Colombo and the hill country in case of Sri Lanka.

There are currently sizeable Tamil-speaking populations descended from colonial-era migrants in Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, and Mauritius. Many people in Guyana, Fiji, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago have Tamil origins,;World Language. [http://www.worldlanguage.com/Languages/Tamil.htm Tamil Language]. Retrieved on 2007-08-16.; but only a small number speak the language there. Groups of more recent migrants from Sri Lanka and India exist in Canada (especially Toronto), USA, Australia, many Middle Eastern countries, and most of the western European countries.

For example, the word for &quot;here&quot; —' in ''Centamil'' (the classic variety)—has evolved into ' in the Kongu dialect of Coimbatore, ''inga'' in the dialect of Thanjavur,and ' in some dialects of Sri Lanka. Old Tamil's ' (where ' means place) is the source of ' in the dialect of Tirunelveli, Old Tamil ' is the source of ' in the dialect of Ramanathapuram,and ' in various northern dialects.
Even now in Coimbatore area it is common to hear &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;that place&quot;. 

Although Tamil dialects do not differ significantly in their vocabulary, there are a few exceptions. The dialects spoken in Sri Lanka retain many words and grammatical forms that are not in everyday use in India,;Thomas Lehmann, &quot;Old Tamil&quot; in Sanford Steever (ed.), ''The Dravidian Languages'' Routledge, 1998 at p. 75; E.

=Spoken and literary variants=
The Tamil alphabet
In addition to its various dialects, Tamil exhibits different forms: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language ('), a modern literary and formal style ('), and a modern colloquial form ('). These styles shade into each other, forming a stylistic continuum. For example, it is possible to write ' with a vocabulary drawn from ', or to use forms associated with one of the other variants while speaking '.;Harold Schiffman, &quot;[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/messeas/diglossia/handbuk.html Diglossia as a Sociolinguistic Situation]&quot;, in Florian Coulmas (ed.), ''The Handbook of Sociolinguistics''. London: Basil Blackwell, Ltd., 1997 at pp. 205 et seq.;

In modern times, ' is generally used in formal writing and speech. For instance, it is the language of textbooks, of much of Tamil literature and of public speaking and debate. In recent times, however, ' has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of '. Most contemporary cinema, theatre and popular entertainment on television and radio, for example, is in ', and many politicians use it to bring themselves closer to their audience.The increasing use of ' in modern times has led to the emergence of unofficial ‘standard’ spoken dialects. In India, the ‘standard’ ' is based on ‘educated non-brahmin speech’, rather than on any one dialect,;Harold Schiffman, &quot;Standardization or restandardization: The case for ‘Standard’ Spoken Tamil&quot;. ''Language in Society'' 27 (1998), pp. 359–385.; but has been significantly influenced by the dialects of Thanjavur and Madurai. In Sri Lanka the standard is based on the dialect of Jaffna.

Writing system

History of Tamil script.
Tamil is written using a script called the ', an abugida belonging to the Brahmic family.The Tamil script consists of 12 vowels, 18 consonants and one special character, the ''āytam''.The vowels and consonants combine to form 216 compound characters, giving a total of 247 characters.As with other Indic scripts, all consonants have an inherent vowel ''a'', which in Tamil, is removed by adding an overdot called a ', to the consonantal sign.Unlike most Indic scripts, the Tamil script does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced plosives.Instead, plosives are articulated with voice or unvoiced depending on their position in a word, in accordance with the rules of Tamil phonology, as discussed below.

The Tamil script evolved from Tamil-Brahmi or Tamili, which differed from Asokan Brahmi in a number of ways.By the 9th century, Tamil-Brahmi had evolved into more rounded characters, called ''vatteluttu'' (meaning ''curved letters''), from which the modern script evolved.In the 18th century, some changes were made to the script by the Italian missionary Constanzo Beschi, known in Tamil as Veeramamunivar, to make it easier to print.These included placing vowel markers in both the left and right of the consonants. Around 1935, E. V. Ramasami Naicker|E.V.Ramaswamy Periyar suggested some further changes to make it amenable to printing.;; Some of these suggestions were incorporated by the M.G. Ramachandran government in 1978.

An eleventh century ' inscription, from the Brihadisvara temple in ThanjavurIn addition to the standard characters, six characters taken from the Grantha script, which was used in the Tamil region to write Sanskrit, are sometimes used to represent sounds not native to Tamil, that is, words borrowed from Sanskrit, Prakrit and other languages. The traditional system of writing loan-words, which involved respelling them in accordance with Tamil phonology remains.;As recommended in the traditional grammar, the Tolkāppiyam.''See'' Tolkāppiyam, Nūrpā 401, &quot;vadacol kiLavi vadavezuttu oriii&quot;; in Tamil, &quot;வடசொற் கிளவி வடவெழுத் தொரீஇ&quot; This rule is in the Chapter on ''col'' (&quot;word&quot;), in the Section for ''eccaviyal'', எச்சவியல்&quot; (&quot;extra items&quot;);

Sounds


Tamil phonology is characterised by the presence of retroflex consonants, and strict rules for the distribution within words of voiced and unvoiced plosives. Tamil phonology permits few consonant clusters, which can never be word initial. Native grammarians classify Tamil phonemes into vowels, consonants, and a &quot;secondary character&quot;, the āytam.

=Vowels=
Tamil vowels are called ' (''uyir'' – life, ' – letter). The vowels are classified into short (') and long (five of each type) and two diphthongs, /ai/ and /au/, and three &quot;shortened&quot; (') vowels.

The long (') vowels are about twice as long as the short vowels. The diphthongs are usually pronounced about 1.5 times as long as the short vowels, though most grammatical texts place them with the long vowels.

=Consonants=
Tamil consonants are known as ' (''mey''—body, '—letters). The consonants are classified into three categories with six in each category: '—hard, '—soft or Nasal, and '—medium. 

Unlike most Indian languages, Tamil does not have aspirated consonants. In addition, the voicing of plosives is governed by strict rules in '. Plosives are unvoiced if they occur word-initially or doubled. Elsewhere they are voiced, with a few becoming fricatives :wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalically. Nasals and approximants are always voiced.;''See e.g.'' the pronunciation guidelines in G.U. Pope (1868). ''A Tamil hand-book, or, Full introduction to the common dialect of that language''.

Phonemes in brackets are voiced equivalents. Both voiceless and voiced forms are represented by the same character in Tamil, and voicing is determined by context. The soundsandare peripheral to the phonology of Tamil, being found only in loanwords and frequently replaced by native sounds. There are well-defined rules for elision in Tamil categorised into different classes based on the phoneme which undergoes elision.

=Aytam=
Classical Tamil also had a phoneme called the ''Āytham|āytam'', written as ‘ஃ’. Tamil grammarians of the time classified it as a dependent phoneme (or restricted phoneme ;; ) ('), but it is very rare in modern Tamil. The rules of pronunciation given in the Tolkāppiyam, a text on the grammar of Classical Tamil, suggest that the ''āytam'' could have glottalised the sounds it was combined with. It has also been suggested that the ''āytam'' was used to represent the voiced implosive (or closing part or the first half) of geminated voiced plosives inside a word.;''See generally'' F. B. J. Kuiper, &quot;Two problems of old Tamil phonology&quot;, ''Indo-Iranian Journal'' 2:3 (September 1958) pp. 191-224, esp. pp. 191-207.;

Grammar


Much of Tamil grammar is extensively described in the oldest known grammar book for Tamil, the ''Tolkāppiyam''.Modern Tamil writing is largely based on the 13th century grammar 'which restated and clarified the rules of the ''Tolkāppiyam'', with some modifications. Traditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely ', ''col'', ', ''yāppu'', '. Of these, the last two are mostly applied in poetry.;
;

Similar to other Dravidian languages, Tamil is an agglutinative language.;; Tamil is characterised by its use of retroflex consonants, like the other Dravidian languages. It also uses a liquid l (ழ) (example Tamil), which is also found in Malayalam (example Kozhikode), but disappeared from Kannada at around 1000 AD (but present in Unicode), and was never present in Telugu.;; Tamil words consist of a lexical root to which one or more affixes are attached. Most Tamil affixes are suffixes. Tamil suffixes can be ''derivational suffixes'', which either change the part of speech of the word or its meaning, or ''inflectional suffixes'', which mark categories such as person, number, mood, tense, etc. There is no absolute limit on the length and extent of agglutination, which can lead to long words with a large number of suffixes.

=Morphology=

Tamil nouns (and pronouns) are classified into two super-classes (')—the &quot;rational&quot; ('), and the &quot;irrational&quot; (')—which include a total of five classes (''pāl'', which literally means ‘gender’). Humans and deities are classified as &quot;rational&quot;, and all other nouns (animals, objects, abstract nouns) are classified as irrational. The &quot;rational&quot; nouns and pronouns belong to one of three classes (''pāl'')—masculine singular, feminine singular, and rational plural. The &quot;irrational&quot; nouns and pronouns belong to one of two classes - irrational singular and irrational plural. The ''pāl'' is often indicated through suffixes. The plural form for rational nouns may be used as an honorific, gender-neutral, singular form.;;

Suffixes are used to perform the functions of cases or postpositions. Traditional grammarians tried to group the various suffixes into eight cases corresponding to the cases used in Sanskrit. These were the nominative, accusative, dative, sociative, genitive, instrumental, locative, and ablative. Modern grammarians argue that this classification is artificial, and that Tamil usage is best understood if each suffix or combination of suffixes is seen as marking a separate case.;Harold Schiffman, &quot;Standardization and Restandardization: the case of Spoken Tamil.&quot; ''Language in Society'' 27:3 (1998) pp. 359-385 and esp. pp.374-375.; Tamil nouns can take one of four prefixes, ''i'', ''a'', ''u'' and ''e'' which are functionally equivalent to the demonstratives in English.

Tamil verbs are also inflected through the use of suffixes. A typical Tamil verb form will have a number of suffixes, which show person, number, mood, tense and voice.
*Person and number are indicated by suffixing the oblique case of the relevant pronoun. The suffixes to indicate tenses and voice are formed from grammatical particles, which are added to the stem.
*Tamil has two voices. The first indicates that the subject of the sentence ''undergoes'' or ''is the object of'' the action named by the verb stem, and the second indicates that the subject of the sentence ''directs'' the action referred to by the verb stem.
*Tamil has three simple tenses—past, present, and future—indicated by the suffixes, as well as a series of perfects indicated by compound suffixes. Mood is implicit in Tamil, and is normally reflected by the same morphemes which mark tense categories.Tamil verbs also mark evidentiality, through the addition of the hearsay clitic ''.''; at p. 105.;

Traditional grammars of Tamil do not distinguish between adjectives and adverbs, including both of them under the category ''uriccol'', although modern grammarians tend to distinguish between them on morphological and syntactical grounds.; at pp. 9-11 ;

Tamil has no articles. Definiteness and indefiniteness are either indicated by special grammatical devices, such as using the number &quot;one&quot; as an indefinite article, or by the context.; at p. 109.; In the first person plural, Tamil makes a distinction between inclusive pronouns நாம் ''nām'' (we), நமது ''namatu'' (our) that include the addressee and exclusive pronouns நாங்கள் ' (we), எமது ''ematu'' (our) that do not.;

=Syntax=

Tamil is a consistently head-final language. The verb comes at the end of the clause, with typical word order Subject Object Verb (SOV).;; However, Tamil also exhibits extensive ''scrambling'' (word order variation), so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different pragmatic effects. Tamil has postpositions rather than prepositions. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.

Tamil is a null subject language. Not all Tamil sentences have subjects, verbs and objects. It is possible to construct valid sentences that have only a verb—such as ' (&quot;completed&quot;)—or only a subject and object, without a verb such as ' (&quot;That, my house&quot;). Tamil does not have a copula (a linking verb equivalent to the word ''is''). The word is included in the translations only to convey the meaning more easily.

Vocabulary

A strong sense of linguistic purism is found in Modern Tamil.;Sumathi Ramaswamy, En/Gendering Language: The Poetics of Tamil Identity&quot; ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 35:4. (Oct. 1993), pp. 683-725.; Much of the modern vocabulary derives from classical Tamil,;For example Cre-A’s Modern Tamil Dictionary contains 15,875 words, of which only a small percentage of words, some with Grantha letters are loan words.; as well as governmental and non-governmental institutions, such as the Government of Sri Lanka, the Tamil Virtual University, and Annamalai University. 

These institutions have generated technical dictionaries for Tamil containing neologisms and words derived from Tamil roots to replace loan words from English and other languages. Sincemediaeval times, there has been a strong resistance to the use of Sanskrit words in Tamil.;Sumathi Ramaswamy, &quot;Language of the People in the World of Gods: Ideologies of Tamil before the Nation&quot; ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', 57:1. (Feb. 1998), pp. 66-92.; As a result, the Prakrit and Sanskrit loan words used in modern Tamil are, unlike in some other Dravidian languages, restricted mainly to some spiritual terminology and abstract nouns.;Dr.T.P. Meenakshisundaram, A History of Tamil Language, Sarvodaya Ilakkiya Pannai, 1982 (translated) p. 241-2; Besides Sanskrit, there are a few loan words from Persian and Arabic implying there were trade ties in ancient times.;Silapadhigaaram, Manimekalai, P.T.Srinivasa Iyengar’s &quot;History of the Tamils: from the earliest times to 600 AD&quot;, Madras, 1929; Many loan words from Portuguese and Dutch and English were introduced into colloquial and written Tamil during the colonial period. 

Words of Tamil origin occur in other languages. Popular examples in English are cash (''kaasu'', a small coin), cheroot (' meaning &quot;rolled up&quot;),;; mango (from ''mangai''),; mulligatawny (from ' meaning pepper water), pariah (from ''paraiyar''), ginger (from ''ingi''), curry (from ''kari''), rice (from ''arici'') and catamaran (from ', கட்டு மரம், meaning &quot;bundled logs&quot;),; pandal (shed, shelter, booth),; tyer (curd),; coir (rope).;;
