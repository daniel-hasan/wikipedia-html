Viva Hate is a rock band that was formed late in the summer of 2004 by Geoff Kresge after he left Tiger Army. Shortly after forming Viva Hate, Kresge was asked to join the HorrorPops, with whom he played guitar withfrom 2004 to 2006, although the official statement of his departure was not made until the summer of 2007, leaving many questions regarding the nature of his parting ways with the HorrorPops.

Kresge was previously the bassist for AFI from 1992 to 1997. Lead vocalist Matt &quot;Wedge&quot; Wedgley was formerly a member of The Force with Hunter Burgan of AFI.

Viva Hate has recorded some demos which are available, in edited versions, on their MySpace profile, but have no current plans to record an album.A vinyl 7&quot; single is planned for release on Halloween 2007.

In February 2007, the band announced that Greg Utter of Swingin' Utters joined on drums. He replaced original drummer Mad Dog Chad, who had left the band to focus on his own project, Ends In Tragedy. In March 2007, the band opened for Kresge's former band, AFI, on several dates through California, Oregon and Nevada.
