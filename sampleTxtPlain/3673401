Jean Balukas (b. June 28 1959) is an American pool player from Brooklyn, New York, and ranks among the stellar players in the history of the sport. At least through the 1990s, when Allison Fisher began her ascendancy, Balukas was widely acknowledged as the sole candidate for greatest female player ever.;;;;;The New York Times Company (February 3 1992).

Young prodigy
Jean's father, Albert Balukas, along with his partner, professional player Frank McGown, was the proprietor of a forty-eight-table pool hall called the Ovington Lounge in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, New York. Balukas's introduction to play was at 4 years of age, not on one of her father's tables but on a 4-1&amp;frasl;2&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;foot pool table in the cellar of her childhood home, purchased by her parents to keep her four billiards-playing brothers out of local pool rooms.;The New York Times Company (October 18 1987).

Wielding an ivory-detailed cue made especially for her in 1965 by renowned cuemaker George Balabushka, at 5 and 6 years of age she would practice straight pool to 50 points after family dinners with her father's encouragement but not participation.;; Many have assumed that she had been tutored in the game. However, Balukas states, &quot;when they find out that my father doesn't play, many people think I must have learned the game from Frank McGown. That isn't true. I taught myself to play pool.&quot;;

In 1966, McGown was staging a billiards exhibition at New York City's Grand Central Station. With her parents' permission, he brought along the 6-year-old Balukas, where she participated in the spectacle. The attention this generated, coupled with her prodigious talent, landed her a guest appearance in 1966 on WNEW-TV's ''Wonderama''. Later that year, Balukas, along with her younger sister Laura, appeared on CBS's popular show ''I've Got a Secret''. None of the panelists were successful in guessing that the 7- and 5-year-old sisters were pool enthusiasts.;;

The following year Balukas appeared an exhibition match at the bygone Carom Club, then located at 1697 Broadway in Manhattan. A second-grader at the time, according to her mother, Peggy, she did her homework and took a nap before appearing at the scheduled match.; Billed as &quot;the Little Princess of Pocket Billiards&quot;, and described by a reporter at the match as &quot;a little girl with honey-blond hair...wearing a short yellow dress and green leotards,&quot; to great applause she edged out her opponent, Roland DeMarco, a pool enthusiast and President of Finch College, with a final score of 50–42.;

In her first appearance in 1976, while a junior in high school, she finished second and was awarded prize money.

Playing with men

According to a 1987 interview with reporter Roger Starr of ''The New York Times,'' she learned much about pool through such activities but &quot;she also learned that, even in fun, pool stars did not like losing in public, especially not to children, and less, even, to girl children. She also discovered that young men, including her brothers, shared the feeling of shame over losing to girls. She recalls, 'Whenever my brother Paul, the youngest of my four brothers, beat me at pool on the table downstairs at home, he would run through the house shouting 'I won, I beat her'. I guess that was one reason I worked all the harder at my game.'&quot; ; 

On August 6 1978 Balukas became the first woman to qualify to play in the men's division of the World Open Pocket Billiards Championship; a tournament with an 100-year history. This meant that she would be competing in both the women's and men's divisions of the tournament to be held on August 12th of that year at the Biltmore Hotel located at 43rd Street and Madison Avenue in New York City.;The New York Times Company (August 6 1978).

Balukas was initially entered in both the men's and women's divisions of the 1987 B.C. Classic, a nine-ball competition.After notable controversy (detailed below), she competed only on the men's side. Along the way she trounced Keith McCready 11–3 (at the time the 17th-ranked male player by money list, and who guest-starred as obnoxious hustler &quot;Grady Seasons&quot; in the 1986 film ''The Color of Money''). Balukas finished in a tie for 9th place among many of the best players in the world.

Dress code controversy
In August 1987, at the annual B.C. Classic hosted at a Holiday Inn in Binghamton, New York, Balukas was slated for competition in both divisions. After arriving, she discovered that for evening-scheduled matches she would be required to wear formal attire that she did not have with her. The men's division, by contrast, had no similar dress code. Balukas took a stand that the women should not be treated differently than the men, and accordingly refused to procure garments that would meet the unequal mandate.; 

The women held a vote as to whether Balukas should be allowed to play. She later explained that &quot;what hurt at Binghamton was that while I was trying to stand up for us being treated the same as men, the other girls held the tournament draw without me. By one vote, they kept me out. And some of the girls who are my best friends voted against me.&quot;; 

She did not agree at the time with the speculation of others that her professional rivals had their own self-interest at heart, knowing that with her out of the competition they would have a much better chance at the $5,000 first place prize award. Despite the women's Wikt:snub|snub and perceived chauvinistic terms, she nevertheless competed on the men's side, tying for ninth place.; Not long afterward, she indicated to a reporter that she was &quot;thinking of dropping out of women's competition altogether.&quot;; 

Soon after the dress code dust-up made headlines, a letter was sent to ''The New York Times'' by the Women's Professional Billiard Association (WPBA), by its president Belinda Bearden, disputing the facts as reported. According to the WPBA, the dress code was self-imposed by the players in an attempt to improve the image of women's pool and to attract more spectators and press to the sport, and that Balukas was the only participant at Binghamton unwilling to comply. They further explained that Balukas first withdrew from the women's division but later returned and asked to play after player assignments had been completed. A vote to allow her to play resulted in a tally of 8-7 in her favor, but after they moved to consult a player who was not present for the vote, Balukas again withdrew from the competition, and that was where the matter had ended.;The New York Times Company(November 27 1987).

Break with the sport
In 1988, Balukas was playing against professional Robin Bell in a televised match of the Brunswick-sponsored World Open Nine-ball Championship held at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Bell, who was Balukas' best friend on the women's tour, had never beaten Balukas but had been playing very strongly in the tournament. With the score 2 games to 3 in favor of Bell in a , Bell made the 9 balltwo games in a row, making the score 5 to 2 in very short order.;;

All television match players wore small microphones so that their words and the sounds of play could be heard by the audience. After Bell's second 9 ball break, Balukas reportedly muttered within the range of the microphone words to the effect the Bell was having &quot;a string of inordinately lucky shots.&quot; She was cautioned by the referee and play continued, with Balukas the ultimate victor with a final score of 9–5.;;;

According to an interview with Balukas appearing in ''New York Woman'' magazine in 1991, Balukas's exact words were &quot;Some world championship&quot; and &quot;Beat me with skill, not luck.&quot; Despite their off-the-table friendship, following the match Bell made a formal complaint to the WPBA about the incident. The WPBA's board of directors thereafter sanctioned Balukas $200 for unsportsmanlike conduct.;;

Balukas was greatly incensed over the sanction and refused to pay on principle, turning away offers by others to pay the fine in her stead. Balukas explains that &quot;It wasn’t the $200... &amp;#91;Women&amp;#93; pool players, who were ranked three and six and five, were the ones who decided I should be fined. I felt it should have been done by an outside panel, not by my competitors.&quot;;;

The sides were at an impasse. Balukas refused to relent and the WPBA refused to lift the sanction and would not allow Balukas to play again until she paid the fine. &quot;Just because she was our premier player doesn't mean she was above the rules,&quot; said Vicki Paski in 1992, then president of the WPBA. Professional Loree Jon Jones in the same interview expressed mixed sentiments: &quot;Her not playing is, I guess, sad,&quot; but she reflected that in Balukas's absence, &quot;we've all learned how to win.&quot;;

There were other factors at play. Balukas admits to having been under great pressure, much of it self-imposed. After she reached the pinnacle of her profession, &quot;That’s when I started getting nervous...that’s when I started putting a lot of pressure on myself.&quot; ; &quot;Playing against the men, I learned to lose,... but &amp;#91;losing&amp;#93; hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time.&quot;;

Balukas had also felt some heat from her solo venture into the men's arena. She had heard taunts from the men upon finding out she was going to play in their division, such as &quot;I’m gonna put on a dress and go play with the women.&quot;; In early 1988, Balukas gave in to complaints from the men upon her entry to a Chicago based tournament that it wasn't fair she should have the opportunity to play in both divisions when the men only had the opportunity to play in one, and withdrew from the men's side.; Balukas states that after she arrived in Chicago &quot;I found out that the first- and second-place winners in the women’s event were going to be invited to play in the men’s event. I was stabbed in the back.&quot;;

Ultimately Balukas states that her break with the sport &quot;...was a buildup of everything,... A little burnout, a little frustration. It just got to a point where I had so much animosity toward the pool world. And that was my out. You know, you're going to fine me? Well, see you later. That was my excuse to finally say I need a break.&quot;;
 
For Balukas's part, she returned to Bay Ridge, took over management of her family's pool hall, Hall of Fame Billiards on Ovington Avenue in Brooklyn, and states that &quot;I'm enjoying my life immensely...I have moved on.&quot;; In summing up these events in a 1992 article, ''The New York Times'' stated, &quot;So America's greatest woman pool player competes only for the odd soda. If you're feeling lucky, drop by her poolroom...If you're thirsty...go elsewhere.;
