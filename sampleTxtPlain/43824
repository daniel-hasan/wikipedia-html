ISBN 0814787894. p. 269.;) is an African-American activist who was a member of the Black Panther Party and Black Liberation Army (BLA). In 1977 she was convicted of several felonies including the murder of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster during a 1973 gunfight on the New Jersey Turnpike. During the gunfight and ensuing chase, New Jersey State Trooper James Harper was wounded and Shakur's fellow BLA member Zayd Malik Shakur killed.; ;; ;

She escaped from prison in 1979 and has been living in Cuba with political asylum since 1984. Since May 2, 2005, she has been classified as a &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has offered a $1 million reward for assistance in her capture.
She is the godmother of hip hop artist Tupac Shakur.;Williams, Houston.

Early life
Shakur was born in New York City on July 16, 1947, or, according to the FBI, August 19, 1952, but spent most of her childhood in Wilmington, North Carolina;Scheffler, p. 203.; until her family relocated to Queens when she was a teenager. She attended Borough of Manhattan Community College and City College of New York in the mid 1960s, where she was involved in many political activities. After graduation, Shakur became involved in the Black Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army.;James, Matthew Thomas. Joy James (Ed.). 2005.

Msgr. John Powis alleged that Shakur was involved in an armed robbery at his Our Lady of the Presentation church in Brownsville, Brooklyn on September 14, 1972 based on FBI photographs; Shakur was not charged with this robbery and the only person arrested for it was acquitted.; Daly, Michael. 2006, December 13. &quot;[http://www.nydailynews.com/12-13-2006/news/story/479642p-403539c.html The Msgr. &amp; the Militant].&quot; ''New York Daily News''.;

In 1972, Shakur was made the subject of a nationwide manhunt after the F.B.I. alleged that she was the &quot;revolutionary mother hen&quot; of a Black Liberation Army cell which had conducted a &quot;series of cold-blooded murders of New York City police officers.&quot;; After her capture, however, Shakur was charged with none of the killings which had made her the subject of the manhunt.;

New Jersey Turnpike shootout
Mugshot of Shakur, taken on May 2, 1973
On May 2, 1973, just after midnight,; Shakur, at that time a member of the Black Liberation Army and no longer a member of the Black Panther Party, along with Zayd Malik Shakur (born James F Coston) and Sundiata Acoli (born Clark Squire), was stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike in East Brunswick by State Trooper James Harper and backed up by Trooper Werner Foerster, for driving with a broken taillight, only 200 yards (183 meters) away from a police administration building.; Accounts of the confrontation differ (see the Assata Shakur#Witnesses|witnesses section below), but Zayd Shakur and Trooper Foerester were killed in the ensuing shootout, and Assata Shakur and Trooper Harper were injured. Acoli then drove the car (a white Pontiac LeMans with Vermont license plates);&amp;mdash;which contained Assata, who was wounded, and Zayd, who was dead or dying; several miles down the road, where Assata Shakur was apprehended. Acoli then exited the car and fled into the woods and was captured after a manhunt the following day.;Marpessa Kupendua. 1998, January 28. &quot;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/090.html Sundiatta Acoli].&quot; ''Revolutionary Worker''. No. 94.;

Trials
Between 1973 and 1977, in New York and New Jersey, Shakur was indicted ten times, resulting in seven different criminal trials, including two bank robberies, the kidnapping of a Brooklyn heroin dealer, attempted murder of two Queens police officers steming from a January 23, 1973 failed ambush, and the murder of a New Jersey state trooper.; ;;Nelson, Jim. 1988, February 29. The Soul Survivor; Assata Shakur on the Making of a Radical.&quot; ''The Washington Post''. p. B6.;; Of these trials, three resulted in acquittals, one in a hung jury, and two in dismissals.; In one of her bank robbery trials, the jury determined that a widely-circulated F.B.I. photo allegedly showing her participating in the robbery was not her.; In November 1974, New York State Superior Court Justice Peter Farrell dismissed the attempted murder indictment because of insufficient evidence;;''New York Times''. November 2, 1974. Page 36, Column 4.; for this trial, Shakur had been extradited to New York City on May 16.;''New York Times''. May 7, 1974. Page 96, Column 5.; In October 1977, New York State Superior Court Justice John Starkey dropped murder and robbery charges against Shakur related to the hold up of a Brooklyn club in which Richard Nelson was killed on the grounds that the state had delayed too long in bringing her to trial.;Max H. Seigel. October 26, 1977. ''New York Times''. Page 25, Column 5.;

Judge Leon Gerofsky ordered a change of venue in 1973 to Morris County, New Jersey, saying &quot;it was almost impossible to obtain a jury here comprised of people willing to accept the responsibility of impartiality so that defendants will be protected from transitory passion and prejudice.&quot;;James Hershberger. March 24, 2006. &quot;Assata Shakur: Case of oppression in U.S.&quot; ''Daily Toreador''.; Shakur was originally slated to be tried together with Acoli, but the trials were separated due to her pregnancy, and hers resulted in a mistrial in 1974 because of the possibility of miscarriage; Shakur was hospitalized on February 1.;''New York Times''.

Lennox Hinds. 1998, October 26. &quot;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/097.html The injustice of the trial].&quot; ''Covert Action Quarterly''.; By the time her 1977 trial started, Acoli had already been convicted of firing the bullets which killed Trooper Foerster,; and a total of 289 articles had been published in the local press, most portraying Shakur as dangerous and mentioning her alleged involvement in the various violent crimes for which she had not been convicted.; Polls of residents in Middlesex County showed that 83% knew her identity and 70% said she was guilty.;

After a widely-publicized nine-week trial,; on March 25, 1977&amp;mdash;back in Middlesex County, New Jersey&amp;mdash;Shakur was convicted as an accomplice in the murders of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster and Zayd Shakur and possession of weapons, as well as of assault and attempted murder of Trooper Harper. Although the prosecution could not prove that Shakur fired the shots that killed either Trooper Foerester or Zayd Shakur, being an accomplice to murder carries an equivalent life sentence under New Jersey law.;Alix Kirsta. May 29, 1999. &quot;A black and white case - Investigation - Joanne Chesimard.&quot; ''The Times''.; New Jersey Superior Court Judge Theodore Appleby sentenced her to 26 to 33 years in state prison for assault and weapons charges which was to be served consecutively with her mandatory life sentence for being an accomplice to the murders.;''New York Times''.

January 25, 1974. Page 71, Column 7.; Shakur's defense attorneys were not allowed to question prospective jurors.; Shakur's attorneys sought a new trial on the grounds that one jury member, John McGovern, had violated the jury's sequestration order.;''New York Times''. April 20, 1977. Section 2, Page 23, Column 3.; McGovern later sued Kunstler for defamation;Alan Krebs. February 3, 1978. ''New York Times''.

The judge did not allow evidence of alleged COINTELPRO involvement to be admitted during her trial.; Shakur's defense attorneys had attempted to subpoena FBI Director Clarence M.

=Defense attorneys=
Shakur's defense attorneys included Lennox Hinds, William Kunstler, Evelyn Williams, Bob Bloom, Florynce Kennedy, Ray Brown, and Stanley Cohen, who died of unknown causes early on in Shakur's last trial.;;''Assata'', p. 247.; Her attorneys, in particular Lennox Hinds, were often held in contempt of court, which the National Conference of Black Lawyers cited as an example of systemic bias in the judicial system.;''New York Times''. May 9, 1977. Page 67, Column 6.; The New Jersey Legal Ethics Committee also investigated complaints against Hinds for comparing Shakur's murder trial to &quot;legalized lynching&quot;;''New York Times''. March 2, 1977. Section 2, Page 21, Column 2.; undertaken by a &quot;kangaroo court.&quot;; Judge Appleby also threatened Kunstler with dismissal and contempt of court after he delivered an October 21, 1976 speech at Rutgers University which in part discussed the upcoming trial,;Martin Waldron. December 3, 1976. ''New York Times''. Section 2, Page 21, Column 1.; but later ruled that Kunstler could represent Shakur.;''New York Times''. December 15, 1976. Section 2, Page 53, Column 1.; Until obtaining a court order, Williams was forced to strip naked and undergo a body search before each of her visits with Shakur&amp;mdash;during which Shakur was shackled to a bed by both ankles.; Judge Appleby also refused to investigate a burglary of her defense counsel's office which resulted in the disappearance of trial documents.;

=Witnesses=;

Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur, TrooperHarper, and a New Jersey Turnpike driver who saw part of the incident were the only surviving witnesses.;Evelyn A. Williams. 2005, June 25. &quot;[http://assatashakur.org/appeal_case_facts_2005.htm Statement of Facts in the New Jersey trial of Assata Shakur].&quot;; Acoli did not testify or make any pre-trial statements, nor did he testify in his own trial or give a statement to the police.;Jonathan Schuppe. February 8, 2004. &quot;In parole bid, Chesimard cohort denies killing trooper.&quot; ''The Star-Ledger''.; The driver traveling North on the turnpike testified that he had seen a State Trooper struggling with a Black man between a white vehicle and a State Trooper car, whose revolving lights illuminated the area.;

Shakur testified that Trooper Harper shot her after she raised her arms to comply with his demand, the second shot hitting her in the back as she was turning to avoid it, and that she climbed into the backseat of the Pontiac which Acoli drove five miles (8 km) down the road and parked, and remained there until State Troopers dragged her onto the road.;

Trooper Harper's three official reports state that after he stopped the Pontiac, he ordered Acoli to the back of the vehiclefor Trooper Foerster&amp;mdash;who had arrived on the scene&amp;mdash;to examine his driver's license, and that after Acoli complied and as he was looking inside the vehicle to examine the registration, Trooper Foerster yelled and held up an ammunition clip, as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red pocketbook, pulled out a nine-millimeter weapon and fired at him. Trooper Harper's reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Assata Shakur who had exited the vehicle and was firing from a crouched position next to the vehicle.; Under cross-examination at both Acoli and Shakur's trials, Trooper Harper admitted to having lied in these reports and in his Grand Jury testimony about Trooper Foerster yelling and showing him an ammunition clip, about seeing Shakur holding a pocketbook or a gun inside the vehicle, and about Shakur shooting at him from the car.;;

=Medical evidence=
A key element of Shakur's defense was medical testimony meant to demonstrate that she was shot with her hands up and that she would have been subsequently unable to fire a weapon. A neurologist testified that the median nerve in Shakur's right arm was severed by the second bullet, making her unable to pull a trigger.; Neurosurgeon Dr. Arthur Turner Davidson, Associate Professor of Surgery at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, testified that the wounds in her upper arms, armpit and chest, and severed median nerve that instantly paralysed her right arm, would only have been caused if both arms were raised, and that to sustain such injuries while crouching and firing a weapon &quot;would be anatomically impossible.&quot;;;Walter H. Waggoner. March 17, 1977. ''New York Times''. Section 2, Page 20, Column 3.;Dr. David Spain, a pathologist from Brookdale Community College, testified that her bullet scars as well as X-rays supported her claim that her arms were raised, and that there was &quot;no conceivable way&quot; the first bullet could have hit Shakur's clavicle if her arm was down.;Joseph F. Sullivan. March 18, 1977. ''New York Times''. Section 2, Page 24, Column 1.;;Joy James and T. Denean Sharpley-Whiting. 2000. ''The Black Feminist Reader''. Blackwell Publishing. ISBN 0631210075. p. 279.; Judge Appleby eventually cut off funds for expert defense testimony.;

=Forensic evidence and police reports=
Neutron activation analysis administered after the shootout showed no gun powder residue on Shakur's fingers; her fingerprints were not found on any weapon at the scene, according to forensic analysis performed at the Trenton, New Jersey crime lab and the F.B.I. crime labs in Washington, D.C..;Ron Howell. June 7, 1998. &quot;Revolutionary on Ice: Assata Shakur's Cuban Exile.&quot; Newsday.;

According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot to the administration building 200 yards (183 meters) away, he did report Foerster's presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, more than an hour later.;

Imprisonment
After the Turnpike shootings, Shakur was imprisoned in New Jersey State Reception and Correction center;Ward Churchill and Jim Vander Wal. p. 410.; in Yardville, Middlesex County, New Jersey and later moved to Rikers Island Correctional Institution for Women in New York City; where she was kept in solitary confinement.;Muhammad, Nisa Islam. 2005, May 16. &quot;[http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_1990.shtml Assata: The stakes are raised].&quot; ''Final Call News''.;;''New York Times''. April 12, 1977. Page 71, Column 2.; After a bomb threat was made against Judge Appleby, Sheriff Joseph DeMarino lied to the press about the exact date of her transfer to Clinton State Correctional Institute for security reasons.;''New York Times''. March 31, 1977. Section 2, Page 6, Column 3.; She was also transferred from Clinton Prison for Women to the Yardville Youth Correction and Reception Center in New Jersey, where she was the only female inmate,;Albin Krebs. April 8, 1978. ''New York Times''. Page 21, Column 3.; for &quot;security reasons.&quot;;Walter H. Waggoner. April 8, 1977. ''New York Times''. Section 2, Page 13, Column 4.; On May 6, 1977, Trenton Federal District Court Judge Clarkson Fisher denied Shakur's request for a transfer from the all-male facility to Clinton Correctional Facility.;''New York Times''. May 6, 1977. Section 2, Page 4, Column 3.;; Shakur's only daughter, Kakuya Shakur, was conceived during her trial and born in September 1974;Joyce Jensen. September 15, 1974. ''New York Times''. Section 4, Page 13, Column 1.; at the fortified psychiatric ward at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens.;''New York Times''. September 1, 1974. Page 40, Column 7.; Kamau Sadiki (a.k.a. Fred W. X. Hilton), a co-defendant who shared a cell with Shakur during their trial for armed robbery in the Bronx (of which both were acquitted), is believed to be the father.;

On April 8, 1978, Shakur was transferred to Alderson Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, West Virginia where she met Puerto Rican nationalist Lolita Lebrón; and Mary Alice, a Catholic nun, who introduced Shakur to the concept of liberation theology.;Scheffler, p. 206.; At Alderson, Shakur was housed in the Maximum Security Unit, which also contained several members of the Aryan Sisterhood as well as Sandra Good and Lynette Fromme, followers of Charles Manson.;Scheffler, p. 204.; 

On March 31, 1978,;''New York Times''. March 31, 1978. Section 2, Page 17, Column 3.;, after the Maximum Security Unit at Alderson was closed,; Shakur was transferred to the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey.; A 1979 special UN investigation into human rights abuses of political prisoners cited Shakur as &quot;one of the worst cases&quot; of such abuses and including her in a &quot;a class of victims of FBI misconduct through the COINTELPRO strategy and other forms of illegal government conduct who as political activists have been selectively targeted for provocation, false arrests, entrapment, fabrication of evidence, and spurious criminal prosecutions.&quot;;;''Covert Action Quarterly''. October 26, 1998. &quot;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/093.html The U.N. Petition].&quot;;

Escape and political asylum in Cuba
On November 2, 1979 she escaped the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey, when three members of the Black Liberation Army visiting her drew concealed .45-caliber pistols, seized two guards as hostages and commandeered a prison van.; ; No one, including the guards, was injured during the prison break.; Charged with assisting in her escape was her brother, Mutulu Shakur, and Silvia Baraldini; Ronald Boyd Hill was also held on charges related to the escape.;''New York Times''. November 29, 1979. Section 2, Page 4, Column 4.; In part for his role in the event, Mutulu was named on July 23, 1982 as the 380th addition to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, where he remained for the next four years until his capture in 1986. State correction officials disclosed in November 1979 that they had not run identity checks on Shakur's visitors;Robert Hanley. November 6, 1979. ''New York Times''. Section 2, Page 2, Column 1.; and that the three men and one woman who assisted in her escape had presented false identification to enter the prison's visitor room,;Robert Hanley. November 4, 1979. ''New York Times''. Page 31, Column 6.; before which they were not searched.;

After her escape, Assata lived as a fugitive for the next several years. The F.B.I. circulated &quot;wanted&quot; posters throughout the New York-New Jersey area; her supporters hung &quot;Assata Shakur is welcome here&quot; posters in response.;Cleaver, Kathleen. 2005, August. &quot;The Fugitive.&quot; ''Essesnce''.; In July 1980, FBI director William Webster said that the search for Shakur had beenfrustrated by residents' refusal to cooperate, and the ''New York Times'' reported that his public commitments to protect civil liberties had been &quot;clouded&quot; by &quot;apparently crude sweeps&quot; through Harlem buildings, in search of Shakur.;''New York Times''. July 2, 1980. &quot;A Cloud Over the New FBI.&quot; Section A, Page 26, Column 1.; In particular, one pre-dawn April 20, 1980 raid on 92 Morningside Avenue, during which FBI agents armed with shotguns and machine guns broke down doors, and rummaged through the building for several hours while preventing residents from leaving, was perceived by residents as having &quot;racist overtones.&quot;;''New York Times''. June 11, 1980. &quot;Our tinderboxes for radical violence.&quot; Section A, Page 30, Column 4.; In October 1980, New Jersey and New York City Police denied published reports that they had declined to raid a Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn building where Shakur was suspected to be hiding for fear of provoking a racial incident.;''New York Times''. October 15, 1980. &quot;The City; Chesimard Report Called Unfounded.&quot; Section B, Page 3, Column 1.;

''Assata: An Autobiography''
She fled to Cuba in 1984 where she was granted political asylum, saying she had never received a fair trial.; In 1985 she was reunited with her daughter, Kakuya, who had previously been raised by Shakur's mother in New York.; She published ''Assata: An Autobiography'', which was written in Cuba, in 1987. Her autobiography has been cited in relation to critical legal studies;Farley, Anthony Paul. 2001, March. &quot;SYMPOSIUM CRITICAL LEGAL HISTORIES: LILIES OF THE FIELD: A CRITIQUE OF ADJUDICATION.&quot; 22 Cardozo L. Rev. 1013.; and critical race theory.;Farley, Anthony Paul. 2005, Fall. &quot;GOING BACK TO CLASS? THE REEMERGENCE OF CLASS IN CRITICAL RACE THEORY SYMPOSIUM: ESSAY: ACCUMULATION.&quot; 11 Mich. J. Race &amp; L. 51.; The book does not give a detailed account of the events on the New Jersey Turnpike, except saying that the jury &quot;Convicted a woman with her hands up!&quot;; Shakur, to this day, maintains her innocence, and her writings to this effect have been widely circulated on the internet.;''Chronic Magazine''. &quot;[http://www.chronicmagazine.com/public.php?level=1&amp;page_id=607 $1 million bounty on Tupac's godmother].&quot;; 

=Extradition attempts=
In 1997, Carl Williams, the superintendent of the New Jersey State Police wrote a letter to the Pope John Paul II asking him to raise the issue of Shakur's extradition during his talks with President Fidel Castro.;Chicago Sun Times. 1997, December 28. &quot;N.J. cops enlist pope; Seek help in getting fugitive out of Cuba.&quot; p. 34.; During the pope's visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with NBC journalist Ralph Penza.;Shakur, Assata. &quot;[http://www.assatashakur.org/escape2.htm An Open Letter from Assata].&quot; p. 2.; Shakur later published an extensive criticism of the NBC segment, which interpliced footage of Trooper Foerster's grieving widow with an FBI photo connected to a bank robbery of which Shakur had been acquitted.;Assata Shakur and Ida E. Lewis. November 1, 2000. &quot;Assata Shakur: Profiled and on the Run.&quot; ''New Crisis''. Vol. 107, Issue 6.; On March 10, 1998&amp;mdash;the 85th anniversary of the death of Harriet Tubman&amp;mdash;New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman asked Attorney General Janet Reno to do whatever it takes to return Shakur from Cuba.;Brath, Elombe. 1998, March 13. &quot;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/100.html N.J. Bloodhounds on Assata's Trail].&quot; ''NY Daily Challenge''.; Later in 1998, U.S. media widely reported claims that the United States State Department had offered to lift the Cuban embargo in exchange for the return of ninety U.S. political exiles, including Shakur.;James, Joy. p. 115.;

In 1998, the United States Congress passed a resolution asking Cuba for her &quot;return&quot;;House Concurrent Resolution 254 passed 371-0 in the House and by unanimous consent in the Senate.;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HC00254:@@@R House Concurrent Resolution 254].; Many members of the Congressional Black Caucus later explained that they were against her extradition, but mistakenly voted for the bill which was placed on the accelerated suspension calendar, generally reserved for non-controversial legislation.;Waters, Maxine. 1998, September 29. &quot;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/089.html Congresswoman Waters issues statement on U.S. Freedom Fighter Assata Shakur].&quot;;Representative Maxine Waters of California, who voted for the resolution, later explained her opposition, calling COINTELPRO &quot;illegal, clandestine political persecution.&quot;;
