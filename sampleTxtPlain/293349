Lethbridge () is a city in the province of Alberta, Canada, and the largest city in southern Alberta. It is Alberta's fourth-largest city by population after Calgary, Edmonton, and Red Deer and the third-largest by area after Calgary and Edmonton. The nearbyCanadian Rockies contribute to the city's cool summers, mild winters, and windy climate. Lethbridge lies southeast of Calgary on the Oldman River. 

Lethbridge is the commercial, financial, transportation and industrial centre of southern Alberta. The city's economy developed from drift mining for coal in the late 19th century and agriculture in the early 20th century. Half of the workforce is employed in the health, education, retail and hospitality sectors, and the top five employers are government-based. The only university in Alberta south of Calgary is in Lethbridge, and two of the three colleges in southern Alberta have campuses in the city. Cultural venues in the city include performing art theatres, museums and sports centres.

History


Before the 19th century, the Lethbridge area was populated by several First Nations at various times. The Blackfoot referred to the area as ''Aksaysim'' (&quot;steep banks&quot;), ''Mek-kio-towaghs'' (&quot;painted rock&quot;), ''Assini-etomochi'' (&quot;where we slaughtered the Cree&quot;) and ''Sik-ooh-kotok'' (&quot;coal&quot;). The Sarcee referred to it as ''Chadish-kashi'' (&quot;black/rocks&quot;), the Cree as ''Kuskusukisay-guni'' (&quot;black/rocks&quot;), and the Nakoda (Stoney) as ''Ipubin-saba-akabin'' (&quot;digging coal&quot;).;

After the US Army stopped alcohol trading with the Blackfeet Nation in Montana in 1869, traders John J. Healy and Alfred B. Hamilton started a whiskey trading post at Fort Hamilton, near the future site of Lethbridge. The post's nickname became Fort Whoop-Up.;; The whiskey trade led to the Cypress Hills massacre of many native Assiniboine in 1873. The North West Mounted Police, sent tostop the trade and establish order,; arrived at Fort Whoop-Up on 9 October 1874. They managed the post for the next 12 years.;

Lethbridge's economy developed from drift mines opened by Nicholas Sheran in 1874 and the North Western Coal and Navigation Company in 1882. North Western's president was William Lethbridge, from whom the city derives its name.;; By the turn of the century, the mines were employing about 150 men and producing about 300 tonnes of coal each day.; In 1896, local collieries were the largest coal producers in the Northwest Territories;[http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/Enjoying+Lethbridge/Picture+Gallery/History+of+Lethbridge/Masonry+Sculptures/Masonry.htm City of Lethbridge website];, with production peaking during World War I. After the war, increasing oil and natural gas production gradually replaced coal production,; and the last mine in Lethbridge closed in 1957. 

The first rail line in Lethbridge was opened on 28 August 1885 by the Alberta Railway and Coal Company,; which bought the North Western Coal and Navigation Company five years later.;; The rail industry's dependence on coal and the Canadian Pacific Railway's efforts to settle southern Alberta with immigrants boosted Lethbridge's economy. After the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) moved the divisional point of its Crowsnest Line from Fort Macleod to Lethbridge in 1905, the city became the regional centre for Southern Alberta.; In the mid-1980s, the CPR moved its rail yards in downtown Lethbridge to nearby Kipp, and Lethbridge ceased being a rail hub.;;

Between 1907 and 1913, a development boom occurred in Lethbridge, making it the main marketing, distribution and service centre in southern Alberta.; Such municipal projects as a water treatment plant, a power plant, a streetcar system, and exhibition buildings — as well as a construction boom and rising real estate prices — transformed the mining town into a significant city.; Between World War I and World War II, however, the city experienced an economic slump. Development slowed, drought drove farmers from their farms, and coal mining rapidly declined from its peak.; After World War II, irrigation of farmland near Lethbridge led to growth in the city's population and economy. Lethbridge College (previously Lethbridge Community College) opened in April 1957 and the University of Lethbridge in 1967.;

Government

Lethbridge City Hall
Eight aldermen and a mayor make up the Lethbridge City Council.;; City voters elect a new government every three years, in October. Lethbridge does not have a ward system, so voters choose all eight aldermen.; The City of Lethbridge has an operating budget of C$200&amp;nbsp;million, more than half of which comes from property tax.;[http://www.lethbridge.ca/NR/rdonlyres/DDEC3079-A129-49FD-AF56-EAB1E41CBDEB/4462/BudgetPresentation0608BudgetOverview.pdf 2006–2008 Preliminary Operating Budget Overview], City of Lethbridge; One Member of Parliament (MP) representing Lethbridge sits in the House of Commons in Ottawa, and two members of Alberta's legislative assembly (MLAs), representing Lethbridge East (Liberal) and Lethbridge West (PC), sit in the legislative assembly in Edmonton.

Traditionally, political leanings in Lethbridge have been Right-wing politics|right-wing. Federally, from 1917 to 1930, Lethbridge voters switched between various federal parties,;; but from 1935 to 1957, they voted Social Credit in each election.; Progressive Conservatives held office from 1958 until 1993, when the Reform Party of Canada was formed.;;;;; The Reform party and its various subsequent incarnations have dominated the polls since.;

Geography and climate

Map of southern Alberta

The city of Lethbridge is located at 49.7° north latitude and 112.833° west longitude and covers an area of . The city is divided by the Oldman River; its valley has been turned into one of the largest urban park systems in North America atof protected land.;; The city is Alberta's fourth largest by population after Calgary, Edmonton, and Red Deer. It is the third largest in area after Calgary and Edmonton and is near the Canadian Rockies, 210&amp;nbsp;kilometres (130&amp;nbsp;miles) southeast of Calgary.

Map of Lethbridge

Lethbridge is split into three geographical areas: north, south and west. The Oldman River separates West Lethbridge from the other two while the Crowsnest Highway and the Canadian Pacific Railway rail line separate North and South Lethbridge.;; The newest of the three areas, West Lethbridge (pop. 27,154);, &quot;Lethbridge Census 2006 - City population up 1.96% per cent since 2005&quot;, 25 May 2006; is home to the University of Lethbridge. Much of the city's recent growth has been on the west side, and it has the youngest median age of the three. The north side (pop. 23,241); was originally populated by workers from local coal mines. It has the oldest population of the three areas, is home to multiple industrial parks and includes the former town of Hardieville, which was annexed by Lethbridge in 1978.;;;; South Lethbridge (pop. 28,318); is the commercial heart of the city. It contains the downtown core, the bulk of retail and hospitality establishments, and the Lethbridge College.

=Climate=
Lethbridge has a moderate continental climate with an average maximum temperature of 12.3 °C (54.1 °F) and an average minimum temperature of −1.0 °C (30.2 °F). With an average precipitation of 386.3&amp;nbsp;millimetres (15.21&amp;nbsp;in) and 264 dry days on average, Lethbridge is the second driest city in Canada.; On average, Lethbridge has 116 days with wind speed of 40&amp;nbsp;km/h (25&amp;nbsp;mph) or higher, ranking it as the second city in Canada for such weather.;[http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/weather/winners/intro-e.html Weather Winners], Environment Canada. Accessed 26 December 2006.;

Its high elevation of 929&amp;nbsp;metres (3,048&amp;nbsp;ft) and close proximity to the Rocky Mountains provides Lethbridge with cooler summers than other locations in the Canadian prairies.;[http://www.chooselethbridge.ca/media/publication_1.pdfBusiness Investment Profile 2005/2006], Economic Development Lethbridge. 2005. Accessed 7 November 2006.; These factors protect the city from strong northwest and southwest winds and contribute to frequent chinook winds during the winter. Lethbridge winters have the highest temperatures in the prairies, reducing the severity and duration of winter cold periods and resulting in fewer days with snow cover.;[http://lethbridgechamber.com/community.php Community Profile], Lethbridge Chamber of Commerce.

Four provincial highways (3, 4, 5, and 25) run through or terminate in Lethbridge. This has led to the creation of major arterial roads, including Mayor Magrath Drive, University Drive and Scenic Drive. This infrastructure and its location on the CANAMEX Corridor has helped make Lethbridge and its freight depots a major shipping destination.; Lethbridge is 100&amp;nbsp;kilometres (62&amp;nbsp;mi) north of the United States border via Highways&amp;nbsp;4 and 5 and 210&amp;nbsp;kilometres (130&amp;nbsp;mi) south of Calgary via Highways 2 and 3. Highways&amp;nbsp;2, 3 and 4 form part of the CANAMEX trade route between Mexico, the United States, and Canada.;

Lethbridge is near the Lethbridge County Airport and the CPR rail yards in Kipp, Alberta. The rail yards were moved to Kipp, just west of the city, from downtown Lethbridge in 1983 to make way for commercial expansion.;[http://www.crowsnest-highway.ca/cgi-bin/citypage.pl?city=COALHURST Coalhurst, Alberta : History], The Virtual Crowsnest Highway. Accessed 26 December 2006.; The county airport provides commercial flights—to Calgary, Edmonton and other Alberta cities, and to Mexico—as well as private and charter flights elsewhere.
