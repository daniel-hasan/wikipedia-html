Christian Klien (born Hohenems, February 7 1983) is an Austrian Formula One racing driver. Klien has yet to achieve a race win or a podium finish in Formula One. 

Klien started his career in motorsport in his early teens; racing in karting championships both in Austria and Switzerland before moving up to Formula BMW. After several more titles in lower Formulas, Klien moved up into Formula One with the Jaguar Racing team, alongside Mark Webber. At the end of 2004, Jaguar's Formula One team was sold to Red Bull and renamed ''Red Bull Racing''; Klien shared the race seat with Italian Vitantonio Liuzzi. The Austrian stayed at Red Bull for 2006, with Liuzzi going to Red Bull junior team, Scuderia Toro Rosso.

After an unsuccessful 2006, it was announced that Klien's old teammate Mark Webber would replace him for the 2007 season. Klien was offered a few alternatives to Formula One for 2007, including a drive in the ChampCar series, but Klien refused and aimed for a drive in Formula One. He was eventually given a test driver role at Honda despite competition from other drivers, including the likes of Gary Paffett.

Personal and early life
Christian Klien was born on February 7, 1983 in Hohenems, in the Austrian Alps to Herma and Hennes Klien. Klien has a sister called Carina.
