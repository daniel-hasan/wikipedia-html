&quot;Rich Girl&quot; is a pop-ragga song performed by singer Gwen Stefani featuring Eve. The song was primarily written by Dr. Dre, Eve, and Stefani, with other collaborators for Stefani's debut solo album ''Love. Angel. Music. Baby'' (2004). &quot;Rich Girl&quot; is based on the Louchie Lou and Michie One song of the same name, which is an adaptation of the ''Fiddler on the Roof'' song &quot;If I Were a Rich Man&quot;. In the song, Stefani discusses her dreams of fame and riches from the perspective of &quot;when she was just an Orange County girl&quot;.;Wener, Ben.

Retrieved May 2, 2007.;

The last song to be included on the album,; &quot;Rich Girl&quot; was released as the album's second single in late 2004 (see 2004 in music) to mixed reviews from music critics. It was a commercial success, reaching the top ten on the majority of the charts it entered, and topped the singles chart in Argentina. In the United States, &quot;Rich Girl&quot; was certified double platinum, and it received a nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 48th Grammy Awards.

Writing process
Gwen Stefani and Eve had previously collaborated together on the 2001 single &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind.&quot; When Stefani first began recording solo material, Eve expressed interest in working with Stefani again, saying, &quot;She's fly, she's tight and she is talented.

After playing some of the songs on which she had been working, Dr. Dre told her, &quot;You don't want to go back there.&quot;Instead of using one of the tracks, Dr. Dre instead suggested using reggae duo Louchie Lou and Michie One's 1993 song &quot;Rich Girl,&quot; which itself interpolated &quot;If I Were a Rich Man&quot; from the 1964 musical ''Fiddler on the Roof''.; Stefani and Eve helped each other with their parts, but when they presented Dr. Dre with the demo, he told them to rewrite the song,; suggesting that Stefani play a character in the song.;

Since she had not seen the musical since she was a child, Stefani went to Broadway to better understand the theme that &quot;even if you're poor and you have love, you're rich.&quot;; The idea which became the final version came to Stefani while brainstorming on her treadmill.; She commented that the troubles in writing the song came because &quot;Dre was really pushing me to write in a new way,&quot; but when she presented him with the song, &quot;he just totally tricked the track out.&quot;;[http://www.rebelwaltz.com/gwen_stefani.html &quot;Gwen Stefani&quot;].
