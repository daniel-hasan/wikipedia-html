Titanium tetrachloride or titanium(IV) chloride is the chemical compound with the formula TiCl;4;.

TiCl;4; is an important intermediate in the production of titanium metal and other titanium compounds. It is an unusual example of a liquid metal halide that is very volatile in air, where it forms spectacular opaque clouds of titanium dioxide (TiO;2;) and hydrogen chloride (HCl). It is sometimes humourously referred to as &quot;tickle&quot;.;[http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_chlorine/science_sec.asp?CID=1241&amp;DID=4719&amp;CTYPEID=113] American Chemistry;

Properties and structure
TiCl;4; is a dense, colourless distillable liquid, although crude samples may be yellow or even red-brown. It is one of the rare transition metal chlorides that is in liquid state at room temperature, VCl;4; being another example. This distinctive property arises from the fact that TiCl;4; is molecular; that is, each TiCl;4; molecule is relatively weakly associated with its neighbours. Most metal chlorides are polymers, where the chloride atoms bridge between the metals. The attraction between the individual TiCl;4; molecules is weak, primarily van der Waals forces, and these weak interactions result in low melting and boiling points, similar to those of CCl;4;.

TiCl;4; is tetrahedral, which is consistent with its description as Ti;4+; surrounded by four Cl;-; ligands. Ti;4+; has a &quot;closed&quot; electronic shell, with the same number of electrons as the inert gas argon.This configuration leads to highly symmetrical structures, hence the tetrahedral shape of the molecule.

TiCl;4; is soluble in toluene and chlorocarbons, as are other non-polar species.Evidence exists that certain arenes form complexes of the type [(C;6;R;6;)TiCl;3;];+;. TiCl;4; reacts exothermically with donor solvents such as THF to give hexacoordinated adducts.;;Bulkier ligands (L) give pentacoordinated derivatives TiCl;4;L.

The main problem with handling TiCl;4;, aside from its tendency to release corrosive hydrogen chloride, is the formation of titanium oxides and oxychlorides that cement stoppers and syringes.

Production
TiCl;4; is produced by the Chloride process, which involves the reduction of titanium oxide ores, typically ilmenite or rutile, with carbon under flowing chlorine at 900&amp;nbsp;°C. Impurities are removed by distillation to afford pure TiCl;4;.

2FeTiO;3;+ 7Cl;2; + 6C → 2TiCl;4; + 2FeCl;3; + 6CO

TiCl;4; is inexpensive, thus it is typically purchased for laboratory operations.

Applications
=Production of titanium metal=
:TiO;2; +2Cl;2; + 2C → TiCl;4; + 2CO

Reduction of TiCl;4; using magnesium metal produces titanium metal; this is in fact the final step of the Kroll process.

:2Mg + TiCl;4; → 2MgCl;2;(l) + Ti

Liquid sodium has sometimes been used instead of magnesium as the reducing agent in the production of titanium metal.

:4Na + TiCl;4; → 4NaCl + Ti

=Production of titanium dioxide=
Around 90% of the TiCl;4; production is used to make pigment; titanium(IV) oxide (TiO;2;).Key is the reaction of TiCl;4; with water to form hydrochloric acid:

TiCl;4; + 2H;2;O → TiO;2;+4HCl

Or sometimes it is oxidised directly with pure oxygen:

TiCl;4; + 2O;2; → TiO;2;+2Cl;2;

=Smoke-screens=
In the past titanium tetrachloride has also been used to create naval smoke-screen|smokescreens. When sprayed into the air, TiCl;4;rapidly reacts with atmospheric moisture:

:TiCl;4; + 2H;2;O → TiO;2;+4HCl

The hydrogen chloride immediately absorbs more water to form tiny droplets of hydrochloric acid, which (depending on humidity) may absorb still more water, to produce large droplets that efficiently scatter light. In addition, the intensely white titanium dioxide is also an efficient light scatterer.Due to the corrosiveness of this smoke, however, TiCl;4; is no longer used.

Chemical reactions
=Organometallic and inorganic chemistry=
TiCl;4; adopts similar structures to TiBr;4; and TiI;4;; the three compounds share many similarities.TiCl;4; and TiBr;4; react to give mixed halides TiCl;4-x;Br;x;, where x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.Magnetic resonance measurements also indicate that halide exchange is also rapid between TiCl;4; and VCl;4;.;;

TiCl;4; is a superb and versatile Lewis acid, as indicated by its tendency to hydrolyze, which implicates the intermediacy of TiCl;4;(H;2;O).With THF, TiCl;4; forms yellow crystals of TiCl;4;(THF);2;.With Cl;-; donors, TiCl;4; reacts to form sequentially [Ti;2;Cl;9;];-;,[Ti;2;Cl;10;];2-;, and [TiCl;6;];2-;.;;Interestingly, the reaction of chloride ions with TiCl;4; depends on the counterion.NBu;4;Cl reacts with TiCl;4; to give the pentacoordinate complex NBu;4;TiCl;5;, whereas smaller NEt;4; reacts to give (NEt;4;);2;Ti;2;Cl;10;. These reactions highlight the influence of electrostatic forces on the structures of compounds with highly ionic bonding.

Much of the extensive organometallic chemistry of titanium starts from TiCl;4;. Its most important reaction is with sodium cyclopentadienyl to give titanocene dichloride, TiCl;2;(C;5;H;5;);2;. This compound is used in organic synthesis (Tebbe's reagent).Arenes, such as C;6;(CH;3;);6; reacts to give [Ti(C;6;(CH;3;);6;)Cl;3;];+;, which is a piano-stool complex.;; This reaction illustrates the extraordinary Lewis acidity of the TiCl;3;;+; entity, which is derived fromTiCl;4; using the even stronger chloride-abstracting agent AlCl;3;.

TiCl;4; reacts with four equivalents LiNMe;2; to give Ti(NMe;2;);4;, a yellow, benzene-soluble liquid.;;This molecule is tetrahedral, with planar nitrogen centers.;;

=Reagent in organic synthesis=
It is widely used in organic synthesis as a Lewis acid,;; for example in the Aldol reaction#Mukaiyama aldol reaction|Mukaiyama aldol reaction. Key to this application is the tendency of TiCl;4; to interact with aldehydes, RCHO,to give adducts such (RCHO)TiCl;4;OC(H)R.It is also used in the McMurry reaction in conjunction with Zn, LiAlH;4;, or another reducing agent in order to join two carbonyls in making a carbon-carbon double bond.

=Olefin polymerisation=
This compound and many of its derivatives are important precursors to Ziegler-Natta catalysts.

=Reduction=
Reduction of TiCl;4; yields TiCl;3;.Reduction of TiCl;4; with aluminium in THF results in the light-blue THF-adduct TiCl;3;(THF);3;.

Toxicity and safety considerations
Given the tendency of TiCl;4; to hydrolyze,the hazards generally arise from the effect of hydrogen chloride. TiCl;4; is a strong Lewis acid, exothermically forming adducts with even weak bases such as THF and explosively with water, again releasing HCl.
