Australia first competed in the Winter Olympic Games in 1936 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and has participated in every Winter Olympics since, with the exception of the 1948 Games in St. Moritz.

Australia achieved its first medal, a bronze, in 1994 in the men's 5,000 metres short track relay speed skating event. Zali Steggall gained Australia's first individual medal in 1998 when she won bronze in the slalom event. In 2002, Steven Bradbury won gold in the 1,000 metres short track speed skating and Alisa Camplin won gold in the aerials event, making Australia the only southern hemisphere country to have ever accomplished gold at a Winter Olympics.

Australia sent 40 competitors to compete in 10 sports at the 2006 Games in Turin, a record number of athletes and events for the nation. For the first time, there was a stated aim of winning a medal, and this goal was achieved when Dale Begg-Smith won the gold medal in men'sfreestyle skiing. Camplin attained her second medal, a bronze in the aerials event.

History
Australia first competed at the Winter Olympics in 1936, when its sole representative, Kenneth Kennedy, participated in speed skating. Australia did not send a team to the 1948 Winter Olympics, but has competed at every Winter Olympics since, sending nine athletes to the 1952 Olympics. At the 1956 Winter Olympics, Colin Hickey, a &quot;rink rat&quot; who was overlooked for ice hockey when he was young because of his small frame,;&quot;Australia and the Olympic Games&quot; by Harry Gordon. ISBN 0-7022-2627-0; came seventh in the 500 and 1000 metres speed skating. 

Australia sent 31 athletes in 1960, its largest team prior to the 2006 Winter Olympics, its size boosted by an outclassed ice hockey team. Hal Nerdal competed in Nordic combined, the only time Australia has ever participated in the event at the Olympics. In contrast to the large 1960 team, the teams in subsequent Olympics were the smallest since 1936, with only three competitors sent in 1968. The 1964 Winter Olympics were marred by the deaths of Australian skier Ross Milne and a British luge competitor. Motivated in part by wanting to prove that Australians can compete with the best (some people attributed Ross's death to inexperience), his brother Malcolm Milne represented Australia at the next two Winter Olympics, won a World Cup event and came third in a World Championship.;

Speed skater Colin Coates competed from 1968 to 1988, coming sixth in 1976 with the 10000 metres event, Australia's best result prior to Lillehammer in 1994. Although a competitor on paper in 1988, Colin was supposed to only be a coach and was forbidden to compete, but when it was time for his event, he put on a uniform and skated his best time ever.; The Winter Paralympics started in 1976, and Australia has attended every Winter Paralympics.

Australia's short track relay team went into the 1992 Olympics as world champions, but the team crashed in the semi-finals.;&quot;Steven Bradbury: Last Man Standing&quot; by Gary Smart and Steven Bradbury ISBN 0-9757287-8-4, 2005.; Australia won its first Paralympic medals in 1992: a gold, a silver and two bronze. In 1994, Australia's short track relay team won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze, having stuck to their finals plan of staying on their feet, remaining undisqualified and beating at least one of the other three finalists.; Zali Steggall won the first individual medal in 1998 with a bronze in slalom skiing.

In 2002, Australia won two gold medals. Steven Bradbury, a member of the bronze-winning 1994 relay team, won gold in short track speed skating when all of his competitors in the 1000 metres final crashed out on the final turn. Jacqui Cooper was previously the favourite to win a medal for Australia in aerials, but injured herself in training. Alisa Camplin, who hadn't won a world cup event before and was so nervous she didn't eat dinner the night before the final,;Sports Illustrated: [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/skiing/news/2002/02/18/womens_aerials_ap/ Flying high: Camplin's aerials win gives Australia another gold] February 18, 2002.; won the women's freestyle skiing#aerial|aerial skiing.

Public support
Interest and support in winter sport has grown over time.; Australia's first entry in the Winter Olympics, while consisting of a single person, was officially sanctioned, with the then Australian Olympic Federation evaluating Kenneth Kennedy's entry. However, supervision and support were relatively minimal. Colin Hickey said that he never got clothing from the Australian Olympic Federation, except for a black armband and tie for the 1952 Olympics to mark the death of King George VI. He also said that Australian officials had &quot;no control over me ... All they'd do was tell me what times I had to do&quot;.; 

After the 1960 Winter Olympics, in which Australia's only ever ice hockey team was soundly defeated, there was debate about the trade-off between selection standards and participation. At a 1963 meeting, Kenneth Kennedy complained that the ice hockey team wasn't given trips because they weren't world class, but could never become competitive unless they had overseas matches. Edgar Tanner said &quot;I ask the winter sports whether they really believe they are in world class, or world ranking, in the field of sport and whether they can do Australia credit, or just be there.&quot; Bill Young, of cycling, disagreed, saying &quot;I thought the first spirit of the Games was to compete&quot;.;

After the 1968 Winter Olympics, in which the only alpine skier was Malcolm Milne, skiing delegate Dr Peter Blaxland said that Australia should not send a skier on his own again for psychological reasons. The response was unsympathetic, with Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes expressing concern that no-hopers might be selected.;

In 1993, a training centre and base called Sonnpark was set up in Axams, near Innsbruck, Austria, a joint venture between the Australian and Austrian Olympic Committees for both summer and winter sports.; Colin Hickey said about Sonnpark &quot;Yeah. It's great ... With that sort of back-up, we'd have given [the Europeans] a run for their money.&quot; Australia has since sold the base.;Fox Sports: [http://foxsports.news.com.au/story/0,8659,18279074-23218,00.html Coates sees future on ice] February 26, 2006.; After the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics, the Australian Institute of Sport#Olympic Winter Institute of Australia|Olympic Winter Institute of Australia (initially called the Australian Institute of Winter Sports) was created. 

Zali Steggall holds up a Smiggin Holes 2010 shirt in ''The Dream with Roy and HG#The Ice Dream|The Ice Dream''Australia competed in five sports in 2002. This was the fewest sports Australia had competed in since 1984. No Australian cross-country skiers competed in the Olympics for the first time since 1976, and no bobsleigh sliders competed for the first time since Australia's debut in the sport in 1988. Australian bobsleigh slider Will Alstergren said &quot;We also beat half the teams currently in Salt Lake City, but unfortunately we couldn't meet the very high standard of the AOC, the Australian Olympic Committee&quot;.;[http://www.ausport.gov.au/fulltext/2002/sportsf/s488161.asp The Sports Factor - interview with Will Alstergren]; Australian selection standards has also been listed as a reason why Australia did not compete in cross-country skiing at Salt Lake City.;[http://www.hoppet.com.au/xc/xcfiles/slc/slc_index.htm XC Files: No Australian Cross Country Skiers...] February 7, 2002.;

During the 2002 Winter Olympics, the Australian broadcaster, the Seven Network, included in its coverage an irreverent talk show hosted by Roy and HG called ''The Dream with Roy and HG#The Ice Dream|The Ice Dream'', in which they interviewed several celebrities and promoted the Smiggin Holes 2010 Winter Olympic bid. 

Stamp of Bradbury Stamp of Camplin
Steven Bradbury and Alisa Camplin's triumphs were celebrated by Australia Post issuing postage stamps of them, which followed on from them issuing stamps of Australian gold medallists at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. They were produced by high-speed offset stamp-printing, unlike the digitally produced 2000 stamps. Bradbury's stamp was issued on 20 February, and Camplin's was issued on 22 February, four days after their respective victories.;[http://www.glenstephens.com/linnsMarch11-02.html Aussie golds in Winter games bring more instant stamps] by Glen Stephens. Linn's stamp news. March 11, 2002.; Each received $20,000 for the use of their image. Bradbury said &quot;Should get me a car. I haven’t had a car for a long time.&quot;;&quot;Gold medallists get framed stamps&quot; Australian Olympic Committee February 25, 2002.; and later described having a stamp issued as &quot;a great honour&quot;.; Camplin was also delighted, saying &quot;For us to be put in with the summer Olympians who had their stamps and the previous 39 sporting legends who’ve had their stamps is amazing.&quot;; 

On 21 February 2006, Australia Post issued a postage stamp commemorating Begg-Smith's Olympic achievement at Turin, saying his gold put him in a &quot;small and honoured group of athletes&quot;.;Australia Post: &quot;Australia Post to release Dale Begg-Smith gold medallist stamp&quot;. Retrieved March 27, 2006.; The Australian Broadcasting Corporation covered the 2006 Paralympics.

Winter sport in Australia

While generally viewed as a country more suited to summer sport (the mock Smiggin Holes 2010 Winter Olympic bid required Australia's tallest mountain to be raised 1000 feet with rubbish, for example), several winter sports take place in Australia. Snow falls on the Australian Alps and parts of Tasmania. The Australian Alps are within driving range for weekend trips for residents of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, while Tasmanian ski slopes are within day trip range for residents of the state.However, there are no runs long or fast enough for the downhill competition and the season is quite short, with the snow skiable for only about three months per year.

In 2004, a mogul course called &quot;Toppa's Dream&quot; was constructed on Blue Cow.;Alpha Magazine: &quot;The Short and Bumpy Road&quot; February 2006.; The Mount Buller World Aerials is an annual event, the first on the World Cup calendar. Aerial skiers practice extensively on water before trying jumps on snow, and Camplin practised jumps in a pond in Wandin (one hour's drive from Melbourne).;Sports Illustrated: [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/news/2002/02/18/murphy_camplin/ She comes from the land Down Under: Aussie aerialist Camplin captures gold in dramatic fashion] February 18, 2002.; The Kangaroo Hoppet, a member of the Worldloppet Ski Federation series of cross-country skiing races, is an annual citizen race that attracts competitors from several countries. Ski jumping is currently non-existent in Australia.;[http://www.skijumpeast.com/masters/imcr2005.htm 2005 International Masters Ski Jumping Championships] report. Retrieved February 2, 2006.;

Many major Australian cities have indoor ice rinks, enabling participation in some winter sports regardless of the city's climate—for example, subtropical Brisbane is a major short track speed skating hub for Australia.; Sydney hosted the 1991 short track speed skating World Championships (in which Australia won the men's relay event), and the 2001 Goodwill Games, hosted in Brisbane, included figure skating. ;

Australia lacks any bobsleigh tracks (used for bobsleigh, luge and skeleton), but there is a bobsleigh push track in the Docklands area in Melbourne.;

Overview by sport
The Australian Institute of Sport#Olympic Winter Institute of Australia|Olympic Winter Institute of Australia has programs in alpine skiing, freestyle skiing (aerial and mogul), snowboarding, short track speed skating, figure skating and (along with the Australian Institute of Sport) skeleton.;Alpha Magazine: &quot;Five Cold Rings&quot; by Anthony Sharwood, February 2006.; Australia also competed in biathlon, cross-country skiing, bobsleigh and luge at the 2006 Winter Olympics.

= Alpine skiing=
Australia has competed in alpine skiing at every games since 1952. Australia's first female skier, Christine Davy, competed in 1956. Malcolm Milne, whose brother Ross Milne died while training at the 1964 Winter Olympics, won a World Cup downhill event in Val d'Isère in 1969, and won a World Championship medal when he came third in downhill in 1970. Milne was considered a medal possibility at the 1972 Olympics, but a knee injury and a near fall denied him this chance.;

Steven Lee represented Australia at three Winter Olympics, and won a World Cup in 1985 in Furano, Japan in the Super G event, the second Australian to ever do so.;&quot;2002 Australian Winter Olympic Team Guide&quot; [http://web.archive.org/web/20030308012801/http%3A//www.olympics.com.au/cp7/c9/webi/externaldocument/000114aq.pdf PDF file] (Accessed December 2005); Zali Steggall won Australia's second Olympic bronze in the slalom event in 1998. Four skiers represented Australia in 2006.

= Biathlon=
Australia has participated in biathlon in every Olympics since 1984 except for 2002, with its best result being Kerryn Rim's 8th place in 1994 in the 15 kilometres individual event. Cameron Morton represented Australia in biathlon at the 2006 Games.

= Figure skating=
Australia first competed in figure skating in 1952, and has competed in 1956, 1960 and every Olympics since 1976. Australia earned some last places or near-misses in earlier years, but has since achieved better results, with Anthony Liu coming tenth in the men's event in 2002. Joanne Carter represented Australia in 2006.

= Freestyle skiing=
Australia has contested moguls freestyle skiing in every Olympics since it became an official sport in 1992, and also participated in it when it was a demonstration sport in 1988.; Australia has taken part in every aerial freestyle event since it became official in 1994, and also was represented when it was a demonstration event in 1992. Australia has been strong in women's aerial skiing, having recruited gymnasts into the sport, and Kirstie Marshall and Jacqui Cooper were both regarded as major medal chances.; Alisa Camplin won Australia's second gold in 2002. 

Nine people, four in women's aerials, four in men's moguls and one in women's moguls, competed in 2006. Canadian-born Dale Begg-Smith won gold in moguls. Aerial skier Lydia Ierodiaconou injured herself when she landed badly in the second qualification jump. Alisa Camplin and Jacqui Cooper contested the aerialsfinals, after Cooper qualified with a world record score of over 213. Camplin went on to win the bronze medal in the finals.

= Nordic events=
Australia first competed in cross-country skiing in 1952, and has competed in 1960, 1968 and 1980 to 1998. Australia has not competed in ski jumping, and Australia's sole entry in Nordic combined was by Hal Nerdal in 1960. Three people represented Australia in cross-country skiing in 2006, larger than any previous contingent. Paul Murray and Esther Bottomley competed in sprint. Clare-Louise Brumley was selected for pursuit and 30 km freestyle, but could only compete in the former due to illness.

= Sliding events=
The first Australian to compete in bobsleigh represented Great Britain. Frederick McEvoy drove the British 2-man and 4-man bobsleighs in 1936, earning fourth and a bronze respectively.; Australia first competed in bobsleigh in 1988, and has competed in the event in every Olympics since, except for 2002. Paul Narracott became the first Australian to compete at both the Summer and Winter Olympics: he had competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in athletics, and participated in bobsleigh in 1992.; Australia competed in luge in 1992 and 1994. Australia did not compete in skeleton at Salt Lake City. 

Australia competed in all three sports in 2006. In bobsleigh, Australia competed in the 2-man and 2-woman events, and was the first country to miss out on gaining an Olympic berth in the 4-man event at the 2006 Challenge Cup. The Australian Olympic Committee tried unsuccessfully to have the Brazil at the 2006 Winter Olympics#Bobsleigh|Brazilian bobsleigh team thrown out due to the use of drugs by Armando dos Santos, in the hope that Australia would take its place. Hannah Campbell-Pegg came 23rd in luge. Michelle Steele, a beach flag sprinter, was chosen after a systematic program to identify a potential skeleton medal-winner from female non-winter athletes, but inexperience with the intimidating and technical track contributed to her coming 13th. Shaun Boyle represented Australia in the men's skeleton event.

= Speed skating=
Australia's Winter Olympic debut consisted of speed skater Kenneth Kennedy, who competed in the 1936 Olympics. Australia has competed in either speed skating or short track speed skating in every Olympics Australia has attended except for 1964.

Colin Coates participated in six Winter Olympics, from 1968 to 1988, and came sixth in the 1976 10000 metres event, Australia's best result before Lillehammer. 

Australia won its first World Championships in a winter sport when its short track relay team won the 1991 event, which was hosted in Sydney.; Short track speed skating gave Australia its first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze won by the men's relay team in Lillehammer 1994. Steven Bradbury won Australia's first winter gold medal in Salt Lake City 2002 when he was the &quot;last man standing&quot;. Five men and Emily Rosemond competed in short track in 2006, but no Australians competed in the long track version.

= Team ice sports=
Australia has competed only once in ice hockey, in 1960. The team lost every game, earning ninth place out of nine countries. Australia has not competed in curling as an official sport at the Olympics, but has competed in it as a demonstration sport. Neither sport was contested by Australia in 2006.

= Snowboarding=
Zeke Steggall, brother of bronze medallist Zali Steggall, represented Australia in snowboarding's first two appearances at the Olympics. The 2006 team consisted of nine athletes competing in all three events in both men's and women's divisions.

The team that represented Australia at the 2006 Winter Olympics was Mitchell Allan (halfpipe), Torah Bright (halfpipe), Andrew Burton (halfpipe), Holly Crawford (halfpipe), Damon Hayler (snowboard cross), Ben Mates (halfpipe), Emanual Oppliger (parallel giant slalom), Johanna Shaw (parallel giant slalom) and Emily Thomas (snowboard cross). Bright came fifth, and Hayler came seventh.

Australia at the Winter Paralympics

Australia has competed in every Winter Paralympics, which began in 1976, and won its first Winter Paralympic medals in 1992, and has been in the medal tally of every Paralympics since. All of the medals have been in alpine skiing.

Australia won four Winter Paralympic medals in 1992—one gold, a silver and two bronze. Michael Milton, an amputee alpine skier, won gold in slalom and silver in super-G. David Munk, a paraplegic sit-skier, won bronze in super-G. Michael Norton, a paraplegic sit-skier, won bronze in the downhill.

In 1994, Australia won nine Paralympic medals, three gold, two silver and four bronze. Milton won gold in giant slalom, silver in slalom and bronze in downhill and super-G. Norton won gold in slalom and super-G. James Paterson, a skier with cerebral palsy, won silver in downhill and bronze in giant slalom. Munk won bronze in giant slalom. Different disabilities have separate events, which is why Paterson and Munk both won bronze in giant slalom. In 1998, two medals were won, both by Paterson: gold in downhill and bronze in slalom.

In 2002, the medal haul was seven, consisting of six gold and one silver. Milton made a clean sweep, winning gold in downhill, super-G, giant slalom and slalom. Bart Bunting, a vision-impaired skier guided by Nathan Chivers, won gold in downhill and super-G, and silver in giant slalom. 

In 2006, Australia sent its first female Winter Paralympian, Emily Jansen, a below-knee amputee skier. James Millar, who was born without his right forearm, was Australia's first Paralympic cross-country skier since Peter Rickards in 1980. Millar also competed in biathlon. Milton attended his last Paralympics. A target of two medals was set, which took into account the consolidation of disability classes.;Sydney Morning Herald: [http://www.smh.com.au/news/Sport/Aussie-Paralympians-expect-fewer-medals/2006/03/08/1141701545264.html Aussie Paralympians expect fewer medals] March 8, 2006.; Australia met this target, with Milton winning silver in downhill and Toby Kane winning bronze in super-G.
