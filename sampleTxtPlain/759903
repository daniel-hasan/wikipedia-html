''A Ghost Is Born'' is the fifth studio album by Chicago-based alternative rock band Wilco. Released on June 22, 2004, it is the only Wilco album that features singer Jeff Tweedy on lead guitar. The band streamed the album online for free, and offered a five song extended play to purchasers.

Tweedy entered a rehab clinic shortly before the release of the album, delaying its release by two weeks. It also shortened its promotional tour. Despite this, ''A Ghost Is Borns opening week was the best sales week for the band at the time and the album was met with good reviews from major publications such as ''Rolling Stone'' and PopMatters. The album earned Wilco their first two Grammy Awards, including one for Best Alternative Music Album.

Production
Wilco signed a contract with Nonesuch Records in November 2001 after a lengthy dispute with Reprise Records over the release of the band's fourth album ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot''.;For an overview of the controversy, see Kot 2004. p. 201-228; ''Foxtrot'' was welcomed with positive reviews from ''The Village Voice''—where the album was rated by the critics as the best album of 2002—and ''Rolling Stone''.; Last accessed July 27, 2007.;; Last accessed July 27, 2007.; It sold over 590,000 copies, earning a Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.; Last accessed July 27, 2007.;; Last accessed July 27, 2007.;

=Composition=
Recording for a new album began in November 2003 under the working title ''Wilco Happens''. The album was produced by Jim O'Rourke, who mixed ''Foxtrot'' and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur. O'Rourke encouraged lead singer Jeff Tweedy to develop his guitar skills for the album--Tweedy recently became the lead guitarist for the band due to the dismissal of Jay Bennett during the ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' recording sessions.;Kot 2004. p. 240;;; Tweedy sought to play solos on the album that were unlike those of jam bands such as Phish and The Grateful Dead. Instead, he performed composed solos influenced by Television such as the one during the coda of &quot;At Least That's What You Said&quot;.; Tweedy refers to the guitar solo at the end of the track as a &quot;musical transcription&quot; of one of his panic attacks.;; ''A Ghost Is Born'' was recorded in a different manner than ''Foxtrot'' or 1999's ''Summerteeth''; whereas those recordings were performed live in the studio and then overdubbed, ''A Ghost Is Born'' was first performed on Pro Tools and only played live once completed. Tweedy was excited about writing an album this way:;Kot 2004. p. 241;



An unusual feature of ''A Ghost Is Born'' is the fifteen-minute long track &quot;Less Than You Think&quot;. For the song, each band member created a synthesizer noise that mimicked an electronic sound. The installations were simultaneously activated in the room and recorded. The noise, which served as the coda to the song, was remixed to provide dynamics to the track. Calling it &quot;the track that everyone will hate,&quot; Tweedy defended the song's inclusion on the album:;Kot 2004. p. 242;



''A Ghost Is Born'' was the first Wilco album with multi-instrumentalist Mikael Jorgensen; he had previously worked as an engineer with the band on their collaboration with The Minus 5. Jeff Tweedy provided lead vocals and acted as lead guitarist for the only time since the band formed. John Stirratt, the only original member aside from Tweedy, played bass and guitar. Glenn Kotche and Jim O'Rourke, Tweedy's associates from Loose Fur, acted as drummer and multi-instrumentalist, respectively. Leroy Bach played a variety of keyboards as well as bass guitar. All members of the band contributed with a synthesizer part on &quot;Less Than You Think&quot;.;''A Ghost Is Born'' album notes, June 22, 2004. Nonesuch Records, 79809.;

Marketing and promotion
Wilco began touring in support of ''Ghost'' even before the album had been released. Multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach left the band after the recording sessions to join a theater production, so Wilco added jazz rock guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone to replace him.;;;Kot 2004. p. 243; Sansone had been playing with The Autumn Defense, a side project led by bassist John Stirratt. However, the tour to support the album had to be abridged. In May 2004, Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago, Illinois due to chronic migraine headaches, anxiety attacks, and clinical depression. In the process of treating the ailments, Tweedy had acquired an addiction to prescription painkillers. His rehab led to the cancellation of the European stage of the tour and a delay in the album's release date. Intended for release on June 8, 2004, the album was officially released on June 22, 2004.;Kot 2004. p. 244;

The band also webcast the album in its entirety on the Internet in a promotion with Apple Computers. Nonesuch was willing to allow the MPEG-4 broadcast due to the success of a similar broadcast in the promotion of ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot''. Additionally, Wilco offered a free extended play to purchasers of the album. The EP featured two outtakes from the album—&quot;Panthers&quot; and &quot;Kicking Television&quot;—and live versions of &quot;At Least That's What You Said&quot;, &quot;The Late Greats&quot;, and &quot;Handshake Drugs&quot;. The EP was later packaged with the album and sold as a &quot;deluxe version&quot;.; Last accessed July 27, 2007.;

Reception
In its debut week, ''A Ghost Is Born'' peaked at number eight on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart and sold over 81,000 copies—the highest U.S. chart peak and best sales week ever attained by the band at that time.;;; Last accessed July 27, 2007.; As of April 13, 2007 the album has sold over 340,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan.; The album was an international hit as well, peaking at number twenty-four in Norway, number twenty-nine in Sweden, number thirty-three in New Zealand, number thirty-four in Belgium, and number thirty-seven in Ireland.; Last accessed July 27, 2007.;

Like ''Foxtrot'', ''A Ghost Is Born'' was well received by critics.; Last accessed July 27, 2007.; John Parales of ''Rolling Stone'' called the album &quot;as eerie as anything Wilco have recorded yet&quot; and applauded &quot;Tweedy offers illuminating curiosity about what can happen in a song.&quot;; Last accessed July 27, 2007.; ''Stylus Magazine'' gave it an &quot;A&quot; grade, named it &quot;album of the week&quot;, and claimed it was &quot;even more brilliant&quot; than ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot''.; Last accessed July 27, 2007.; Michael Metevier of PopMatters also supported the notion that ''Ghost'' was better than ''Foxtrot'', calling every note &quot;purposeful&quot; and said that the album made him &quot;surprised and delighted enough to last several lifetimes.&quot;; Last accessed July 27, 2007.; In 2005, ''A Ghost Is Born'' won two Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package. Although the band was nominated for Grammys for work on previous albums, this was the first time that they won one.; Last accessed July 27, 2007.;

Not all publications shared these views about the album. Pitchfork Media, who had given ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' a perfect 10 rating, only gave ''Ghost'' a 6.6, calling it &quot;wildly uneven&quot; and &quot;less cohesive than any other Wilco release.&quot;; Last accessed July 27, 2007.; Robert Christgau, one of the few detractors of ''Foxtrot'', called the album a &quot;privileged self-indulgence&quot; due to its extreme musical dynamics.; Last accessed July 27, 2007.;
