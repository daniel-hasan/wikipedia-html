Operational history
On 11 April 1943, while escorting a British supply ship to Oro Bay, ''Pirie'' was attacked by a large number of Japanese dive bombers.; At least seven bombs were dropped; the first six were near-misses, but the seventh penetrated the armoured bridge canopy, deflected off the hemsman's station, struck and killed the Gunnery Officer, then detonated on the upper deck.; Apart from the Gunnery Officer, six sailors were killed and four more wounded.; Anti-aircraft fire drove off the fighters before they could attack again, and downed several planes.; Repairs were completed in May 1943.;

''Pirie'' was the third Australian warship to enter Japanese territorial waters during the war, entering Tokyo Bay on 31 August 1945.; She remained in Tokyo Bay until mid-September and was present on Victory over Japan Day (2 September 1945), when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed.;;;

HMAS ''Pirie'' left RAN service on 5 April 1946, and was immediately recommissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Pirie''.; On 21 May 1946, ''Pirie'', along with sister ships HMAS ''Launceston'' and HMAS ''Gawler'', sailed for Colombo for transfer into the Turkish Navy in late 1946.; Renamed TCG ''Amasra'', the ship remained in service with the Turkish Navy until 26 March 1984.;
