Many Japanese words of Portuguese origin entered the Japanese language when Portuguese Jesuit priests introduced Christian ideas, Western science and technology, among other things to the Japanese during the Muromachi period (15-16th century).

List of loanwords

Many of the words which entered Japanese from Portuguese and Dutch are written in ''kanji'' or ''hiragana'' rather than ''katakana'', which is the more common way to write loanwords in Japanese.''Kanji'' versions of the words are ''ateji'', characters added to the words by the Japanese, based on either the pronunciation or the meaning of the word.

The sign † shows that the word is a historical, extinct one.

Arigatō



It is often suggested that the Japanese word ''arigatō'' derives from the Portuguese ''obrigado'', both of which mean &quot;Thank you&quot;, but this is not true.The Japanese phrase ''arigatō'' is a shortened form of ''arigatō gozaimasu'', meaning &quot;Thank you&quot;.This is a form of an adjective, ''arigatai'', for which written records exist dating back to the Man'yōshū, well before Japanese contact with Portugal.;[http://linguistlist.org/issues/12/12-1871.html LINGUIST List 12.1871, Sun Jul 22 2001 Sum: Origins of Arigato]; 

The full derivation is ''arigatō'' ;
