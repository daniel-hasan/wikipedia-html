''Internationalist'' is the third studio album by Australian alternative rock band, Powderfinger. The album was released on 7 September 1998 and was often labelled Powderfinger's most adventurous work, with greater experimentation than in previous works.

''Internationalist'' followed in the success of its predecessor, ''Double Allergic'', and was certified five times platinum in Australia. ''Internationalist'' received four ARIA Music Awards, including &quot;Album of the Year&quot;. The album produced many singles for the band, including &quot;The Day You Come&quot;, &quot;Don't Wanna Be Left Out&quot;, &quot;Good-Day Ray&quot;, &quot;Already Gone&quot; and &quot;Passenger&quot;, which all appeared on Triple J's Hottest 100 poll in two consecutive years.

''Internationalist'' received fairly positive reviewers in the Australian press, and cemented Powderfinger's position on the local music scene; however, the album failed to launch the band in the overseas market.

Background
Powderfinger spent much of early 1997 touring, after the success of ''Double Allergic''. Songwriter Bernard Fanning then spent much of 1997 writing songs for ''Internationalist'' in Brisbane, drawing on inspiration from a mid-1997 band trip to the United States.;;

The album's title refers to escapism – namely, the ability that an &quot;wikt:internationalist|internationalist&quot; has to escape from racial and social tension. When asked in a ''Juice'' interview, Bernard Fanning summarised the title of the album by stating;


Recording and production
''Internationalist'' was recorded at Melbourne's Sing Sing Studios, with Powderfinger accompanied by American producer Nick DiDia for the first time. As the band had already prepared &quot;about 30 or 40&quot; songs when they entered the studio, DiDia's task was relatively minor. Bassist John Collins said of DiDia; &quot;Nick was really good. The way Nick based the record was that he wanted to record the band how we were at that particular moment, he didn’t want to play around too much.&quot;;As a result of this attitude, the band only spent one month in the studio, and the album was mixed by DiDia soon after.;;

Collins described the album as not being as easy listening as their previous work,; and that it contained numerous experiments in songwriting that they had not put into previous albums.; Fanning later said ''Internationalist'' was &quot;a better record&quot; than ''Double Allergic'', but acknowledged that it was not as easily likeable – it was just an improvement in songwriting.; Collins and Fanning acknowledged that the album's experimental nature could lose them some old fans, but the pair drew parallels with bands such as U2, who Collins said had &quot;constantly re-invented themselves, and with success&quot;.; He said Powderfinger's reinvention was as much for the band's own interest as it was for the &quot;public's perception&quot;.; Meanwhile, guitarist Ian Haug described the album as a &quot;moderation&quot; between ''Parables for Wooden Ears'' (&quot;the complicated beast&quot;) and ''Double Allergic'' (&quot;totally simplified&quot;), Powderfinger's two previous albums.;; He also agreed that the album was much more experimental, and described the album as the band's &quot;most successful&quot;, as well as stating that the album that best replicated &quot;the sound we have live&quot;.;;

Numerous songs on ''Internationalist'' were politically and socially influenced, although the band denied it being a deliberate motif.; Fanning explaining that the band did not intentionally discuss political issues, saying &quot;we don't try to do anything in particular&quot;.; He noted, however, that the songs, as his emotional responses to recent events, could inevitably be interpreted as being political.;; When &quot;The Day You Come&quot; was released, there was speculation that it alluded to Pauline Hanson's One Nation political party, although the band claimed the song was vague and didn't specifically refer to one person. Fanning said of &quot;The Day You Come&quot;;

Album and single releases





''Internationalist'' was released in Australia on 7 September 1998.;; The album is currently certified five times platinum in Australia.;;

The first single from the album was &quot;The Day You Come&quot;, a politically and socially influenced song that mused about Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. &quot;The Day You Come&quot; was released as the first single (on 10 August 1998) because, according to Ian Haug, the band could not decide on what to release, so they &quot;just came back to it.&quot;; &quot;The Day You Come&quot; spent nine weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #25.;;

The second single was the double a-side, &quot;Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray&quot;, released on 9 November 1998. &quot;Don't Wanna Be Left Out&quot;, a song about a friend of Fanning's who had difficulty in social situations, is one of the roughest Powderfinger songs to date.; Drummer Jon Coghill also described it as the most difficult Powderfinger song to play live at the time, because it was so &quot;fast and offbeat&quot;.;; &quot;Good-Day Ray&quot; was dedicated to Australian television presenter Ray Martin and his public disagreements with former ''Media Watch'' host Stuart Littlemore. The song was described by Coghill as containing &quot;sort of punk lyrics &amp;ndash; not that we're a punk band.&quot;;; Coghill also described the music video for &quot;Good-Day Ray&quot; as being one of the better videos the band had made.;

''Internationalists third single was &quot;Already Gone&quot;, released on 12 February 1999. The song was a tribute to The Beatles and their influence on Powderfinger's music.;Powderfinger (2004). ''Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000'' companion booklet. Page 10.; The fourth and final single from the album was &quot;Passenger&quot;, released on 9 August 1999.&quot;Passenger&quot; was influenced by Elvis Presley, and included a big horn section, as well as backing vocals from folk group Tiddas.;; &quot;Passenger&quot; won the ARIA Award for &quot;Song Of The Year&quot; in 1999.;; The song's music video was one of Powderfinger's first to feature computer graphics, and was produced by Fifty Fifty Films.; &quot;Passenger&quot; spent 11 weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #30.;;;;

Touring and promotion
Powderfinger went on a nationwide tour after the release of ''Internationalist'', performing with British band Swervedriver and fellow Brisbane band Not From There in capital cities across Australia.;; In 1999, the band toured with Something for Kate and Alex Lloyd.;; Collins described the process of choosing who the band would play with as a simple matter of choosing whose music the band preferred, stating &quot;we had played with most of the bands, and if you're going on tour with someone you may as well go with someone you get along with and whose music you enjoy.&quot;; Despite being fans of Swervedriver, who were renowned for &quot;their capability to reproduce their album sound perfectly in the live setting&quot; according to interviewer Neala Johnson,; Fanning said Powderfinger would never attempt to replicate them, because he believed live shows to be much more &quot;emotionally powerful&quot; than recordings.;

With ''Internationalist'', Powderfinger first set their sights overseas, appearing at numerous music festivals in the U.S., including South by Southwest in Texas.;; While in the U.S., Powderfinger played several showcase performances to record-label representatives in Los Angeles and New York City. In a later interview in Australia, Fanning said these shows were difficult due to the lack of any homegrown fan support.He also said the band were not focused at the shows, and thus they did not go as well as planned.;; Coghill, however, described the showcases as &quot;worthwhile&quot; and &quot;fun&quot;, as were the performances in Austin.; After performing in the United States, Powderfinger completed a tour of Canada. Fanning described the band's overseas outlook as a necessity for an Australian-based band, as &quot;people [in Australia] are going to get sick of you pretty quickly if you're going to do five tours a year, so that you can sustain yourself financially.&quot;;

Reception
Fanning received much positive feedback on the politically-driven lyrics of songs in ''Internationalist''.
''Internationalist'' debuted at #1 on the Australian albums chart, and went gold in its first week, selling over 35,000 copies.;; It then went on to go platinum,;; and is currently certified five times multi-platinum.; At the 1999 ARIA Awards, the album received three awards - &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Album&quot;, and &quot;Best Cover Art&quot;. &quot;The Day You Come&quot; also won &quot;Single of the Year&quot;. In 2000, &quot;Passenger&quot; was nominated for three awards, but did not win any.;;

Haug said he was amazed with the highly positive critical response the album had received, stating &quot;even Molly ;[;Meldrum;]; gave it nine out of ten. Because every review has been so good it’s a bit dangerous to believe it, I think. It’s just strange to read endless good reviews – I wish someone would write a really bad one.&quot;; Haug also said that it was important for the band to develop credibility through the album, saying &quot;people will listen with open ears if you’re a credible band. If you’re not, they turn off before they even hear a new song.&quot;; Coghill agreed with Haug on the album's popularity, stating &quot;you couldn't ask for much better&quot;, and saying he really took notice of the album's positive critical commentary.; Fanning agreed, saying that despite Polydor telling the band the album would be heavily marketed, it was still surprising to see its success.;;

''Internationalist'' was not praised as highly by All Music Guide reviewer Jonathan Lewis as for Powderfinger's previous album, ''Double Allergic''. Lewis stated that &quot;much of the album was a mix of styles and ideas that didn't quite sit right as a whole&quot;.; He contended that the high point of the album is &quot;The Day You Come&quot;, viewing it as &quot;haunting&quot;, but believed the rest of the album was not of the same standard as the song.;;

James Bishop, a reviewer for Sputnikmusic, described ''Internationalist'' as a &quot;beautiful, incomparable and truly surprising album&quot;, giving the album a perfect five.; Bishop stated that the album is a &quot;roller-coaster ride from start to finish&quot; and that Powderfinger are &quot;making great music&quot;.;;

''Rolling Stone'' reviewer Tracey Grimson also praised the album, stating it had &quot;a heightened sense of subtlety, a pulled-back demeanour and choruses which weave themselves mildly out of the dark&quot;.; Grimson's main praise was for the album's cohesion, declaring that it could be identified as a&quot;solid album&quot; rather than a group of good songs &quot;thrown together&quot;.; She also approved of the &quot;glorious backing vocals&quot; of Tiddas.; Grimson's final comment was for Fanning's lyrical sentiments, stating that they were &quot;obviously strong, but conveyed simplistically, without convolution or being overbearing&quot;,; and that they contributed to &quot;the gelling together of ''Internationalist''&quot;.;;

''Juice'' magazine approved of the album, but stated that Powderfinger fans may not enjoy it as much as previous work. The review labelled ''Internationalist'' as more subtle than its predecessor, and said that &quot;Internationalist is more sophisticated and restrained&quot;.; The review said that the album didn't attempt to top ''Double Allergic'', but instead worked on a new level - a level which Powderfinger fans might not be ready for yet.;;
