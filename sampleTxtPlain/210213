Nelvana Limited is a Canadian entertainment company, founded in 1971, that is well-known for its work in children's animation, among many things. It was named by its founders—Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert and Clive A. Smith—after a Canadian comic book superheroine created by Adrian Dingle in the 1940s. Corus Entertainment, a spin-off from Shaw Communications, has owned the company since September 2000.

Most of its films, shows and specials are based on licensed properties, mainly children's literature. But, as with most companies of its kind, original programming is also part of its roster. In spite of its status as a cartoon company, it ventured into the world of live action from its establishment up until the late 1990s.

Well-known franchises from Nelvana include ''Care Bears'', ''Babar'', ''Tintin'', ''Rupert'', ''Fievel's American Tails'', ''Little Bear'', ''Eek! The Cat'', ''Franklin'' and ''6teen'', along with the North American dubs of the anime series ''Beyblade'', ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' and ''Medabots''. It also distributes the Nicktoons ''The Fairly OddParents'' and ''Danny Phantom'', and the Cartoon Network TV show ''My Gym Partner's a Monkey'', outside the United States. As of , its library comprises more than 1,650 cumulative half-hours of original programming.;Fitzgerald, James (May 1, 2001).

History
=1970s=
Scene from ''A Cosmic Christmas'', Nelvana's first TV special
Nelvana started in 1971 when two graduates of York University, Michael Hirsh and Patrick Loubert, teamed up with a British animator-designer by the name of Clive A. Smith in Toronto, Ontario. Hirsh and Loubert, who had a passion for underground filmmaking, had founded a small company called Laff Arts in the late 1960s. Smith, whose interest was in rock n' roll music, had previously been among the crew for the Beatles' animated series and their 1968 film, ''Yellow Submarine''. Hirsh has commented on the background of Nelvana's founding:



Soon after they stumbled upon a collection of local comic books from the 1940s, the trio acquired the ownership rights. In turn, they made a half-hour television documentary for the CBC focusing on Canadian comics. Their two-year travelling tour of the art from the National Gallery of Canada, &quot;Comic Art Traditions in Canada, 1941-45&quot;, gave locals a chance to revisit the country's past heritage in that field.;[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/c/canada.htm &quot;Canadian Heroes&quot; page] at internationalhero.co.uk. Retrieved July 10, 2006.; Meanwhile, Hirsh and Loubert collaborated on a related primer from Peter Martin and Associates, ''The Great Canadian Comic Books''. Amid all this success, Hirsh, Loubert and Smith named their new enterprise Nelvana—after a Canadian comic book superheroine from World War II, Nelvana of the Northern Lights, who was one of the characters in the ''Canadian Whites'' canon.

A derelict apartment in downtown Toronto served as the company's first building, and a homemade wooden stand mounted over a toilet was among its first camera equipment. &quot;To create zooms,&quot; Hirsh recalls his early experience with this machine, &quot;we would pile up phone books under the art work.&quot; During their first year and a half, the trio lived off a superfluous Chargex credit card that Loubert received at university, spending up to C$7,500 on it before they reclaimed double that cost as their first ever transaction.;Fitzgerald, James (May 1, 2001). [http://www.kidscreen.com/articles/magazine/20010501/30888.html?print=yes &quot;Nelvana's 30th Anniversary Profile&quot;]. KidScreen Magazine. Retrieved July 1, 2006.; Under those conditions, Nelvana was involved in the production of documentaries and live-action films. In the area of part-time animation work, they made ten C$1,500 fillers for the CBC.

Among the studio's first productions was a low-budget CBC short subject series, ''Small Star Cinema'', which combined live-action and animation to tell stories of ordinary life from a child's point of view. It was followed by 1975's ''Christmas Two Step'', a similarly-styled special in which a girl tries to be a lead dancer at a Christmas pageant.

Boba Fett, the ''Star Wars'' character Nelvana introduced in its segment of 1978's ''Holiday Special''
Then, thanks to new talent from Sheridan College, all of whom were graduates of the institution, Nelvana worked on their first television specials: ''A Cosmic Christmas'' (1977), ''The Devil and Daniel Mouse'' (1978), ''Please Don't Eat the Planet'' (better known by its subtitle, ''Intergalactic Thanksgiving'') (1979), ''Romie-0 and Julie-8'' (1979), ''Easter Fever'' (1980) and ''Take Me Up to the Ball Game'' (1980). During that time, George Lucas, an aficionado of their work, commissioned the company to work on a 10-minute sequence for the CBS TV film, ''The Star Wars Holiday Special''. This short scene, officially entitled &quot;The Faithful Wookiee&quot;, would introduce audiences to the villainous bounty hunter Boba Fett, who would make his first theatrical appearance in 1980's ''Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back''.

=1980s=
The high cost of ''Rock &amp; Rule'', Nelvana's first feature film, almost made the studio bankrupt.
At the start of the 1980s, Nelvana was offered the chance to work on ''Heavy Metal'', an animated anthology of science fiction stories that studios in Canada and other countries were working on. Nelvana declined this opportunity, instead going on to concentrate on the production of its first feature film, ''Rock &amp; Rule''.

Based heavily on the earlier special ''The Devil and Daniel Mouse'', and originally titled ''Drats!'', the film was produced for five years using all of the studio's resources, totalling $8 million. Upon its release by MGM/UA in 1983, it received little promotion in the United States and quickly disappeared at the box office.

The financial demise of ''Rock &amp; Rule'' would have ended Nelvana's operations altogether, had the company not saved themselves from debt by working full-time on children's television series. On its agenda at that time were its first three live-action franchises, ''The Edison Twins'', ''20 Minute Workout'' and ''Mr. Microchip''. With DiC Entertainment, Nelvana worked on the first season of ''Inspector Gadget'', and animated the pilot episode of ''The Get-Along Gang''.

Early in the decade, the company worked on four television specials based on American Greetings properties. They were ''The Magic of Herself the Elf'', based on Mattel's toy line; ''Strawberry Shortcake's Housewarming Surprise''; ''Strawberry Shortcake and the Baby Without a Name''; and ''Strawberry Shortcake Meets the Berrykins'', the last three of which featured the eponymous doll. There were two shows from Nelvana based on the AmToy properties, ''Madballs'' and ''My Pet Monster''.

Nelvana's work on the Care Bears franchise was among its earliest success stories.
But perhaps its greatest success at the time came in the form of the Care Bears, thanks to its acquisition of the character rights from American Greetings, the franchise owners. In early 1985, the first movie based on the toy line turned the company's fortunes around, grossing $23&amp;nbsp;million in the U.S., and another $1.5&amp;nbsp;million in its native Canada. Its tremendous success gave way to two more big-screen movies, ''Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation|A New Generation'' and ''Adventure in Wonderland'', as well as a television series.;DiC Entertainment also made 22 episodes of the Care Bears series before Nelvana reclaimed the rights for the animated franchise.;
;

In the area of science fiction, Nelvana produced ''Star Wars: Droids|Droids'' and ''Star Wars: Ewoks|Ewoks'', two Saturday-morning series based on ''Star Wars''. At one point, there was talk of an animated CBS show from the studio, based on the BBC's ''Doctor Who''; the plan never came to fruition,;; but concept art was created by Ted Bastien.;;

For Orion Pictures' 1986 live-action western comedy, ''¡Three Amigos!'', the company made use of animatronics in one scene with a talking turtle. In 1987, Michael Hirsh produced Nelvana's first self-made film of this calibre, the Whoopi Goldberg comedy ''Burglar''.

The company's fourth live-action series, ''T. and T.'', premiered in 1988 on Canada's Global network. The show's title duo comprised of Mr. T of ''The A-Team|A-Team'' fame, playing a former boxer named T.S. Turner, and Canadian actress Kristina Nicoll as an East Coast lawyer by the name of Terri Taler. Nelvana faced bankruptcy for the second time when the show's original American distributor was going out of business; in six weeks, they were saved when they found a replacement.;Daly, John (2001, January 31).

As the decade came to a close, the revived Nelvana had its next big success with Babar: The Movie|a movie and an HBO television show based on Jean de Brunhoff's ''Babar'' book series. This franchise, its first international co-production, won many ACE Awards in the U.S. and Geminis in Canada. In September 1989, ABC began to air one of the company's products: an animated series based on Tim Burton's ''Beetlejuice''.

=1990s=
Following ''Babar'';';s success, the studio acquired the rights to animated series based on Hergé's ''The Adventures of Tintin'', Maurice Sendak's ''Little Bear'', Joanna Cole's ''The Magic School Bus'' and the British comic strip ''Rupert the Bear''. Nelvana had self-made successes of its own during the 1990s, such as ''Eek! The Cat'', ''Dog City'' (with Jim Henson Productions) and ''Ned's Newt''.

However, none of those films ever made it past the finishing stage. During the 1990s, another set of features from Nelvana was distributed by different companies. A 1993 live-action thriller called ''Malice'' came out under the Columbia Pictures banner; 1997 saw the studio's retelling of ''Pippi Longstocking'' from Legacy Releasing; and ''Babar: King of the Elephants'' was released in Canada by Alliance Atlantis in 1999. Among them, only ''Malice'' would go on to achieve box-office success in North America.
