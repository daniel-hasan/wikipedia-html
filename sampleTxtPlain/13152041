=''Frenzy''=
Rumors have persisted concerning the release of an improvisational album entitled ''Frenzy''.;;;;;;A post on Lightning Bolt's official website in early 2004 read &quot;The next Lightning Bolt album, Frenzy, is currently in the works over at Load Records. It is expected to be available at the end of the summer.&quot;;;No further word was given, and the next Lightning Bolt album released was in fact ''Hypermagic Mountain'' in 2005.In an early 2007 interview, Chippendale said &quot;When it comes to weird improv stuff, sometimes we're just at a weird stalemate.&quot;;No official word has since been released.
