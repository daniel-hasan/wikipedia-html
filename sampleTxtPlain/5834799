Godstar is a Sydney pop band. The group is fronted by vocalist and guitarist, Nic Dalton who was also in Sneeze, The Lemonheads and ran the Half A Cow record label. 

Between 1991 and 1997 they released two albums, two compilations, and at least 15 singles or contributions to other compilation discs. In 1996 the band toured Australia promoting their ''Sleeper'' album. 

Like so many other Half A Cow bands, Godstar had a long list of players. On any particular song, the only common members were likely to be Nic Dalton and Tom Morgan. The number of people on any particular track varied wildly, and belied the simple pop punk nature of the songs. 

The ''September'' album was released under the moniker &quot;The Godstar Reminder&quot; and on the back of the packaging there is the line &quot;a compilation&quot;. In reality, it is not a compilation - more a collection of otherwise unreleased tracks, including some solo Nic Dalton.
