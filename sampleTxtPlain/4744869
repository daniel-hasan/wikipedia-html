''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance'' is an action role-playing game released in 2006. It is set within the fictional Marvel Universe and features many of the superheroes, supervillains, and supporting characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics.

Story
The heroes battle Dr. Doom and the group of supervillains known as the Masters of Evil. The missions across a range of interactive locations, including the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier; Stark Tower; Omega Base; Atlantis; the palace of the villain the Mandarin; Murderworld; the realm of the demon Mephisto; Asgard; Uatu the Watcher's base; aboard a Shi'ar space vessel; a Skrull world and finally Castle Doom on a revised version of Earth.

Features
Players can select teams of four from a range of more than twenty playable characters (although some characters are not initially available and need to be unlocked), allowing them to create their own superhero teams or recreate famous teams from the publications. Bonuses are also available if forming certain groups (e.g. the Avengers or the Fantastic Four). The game also has alternative endings, dictated by the number of optional missions the player completes. Also included are trivia, artwork and &quot;simulator discs&quot;. The discs unlock non-story related missions for characters and pit them against a variety of villains. Each character also has a variety of costumes that offer various advantages.

Versions
The game is available through several gaming systems, with a graphical engine that looks different on its various platforms.

=Game Boy Advance=
&quot;Marvel: Ultimate Alliance&quot; has been altered for the Game Boy Advance port and has become a side-scrolling fighting game with minor RPG elements, such as the ability to alter your characters' stats. The graphics are simplified for this system and the selection of characters has also been reduced. Some additional gameplay modes were added into this version of the game including a S.H.I.E.L.D. Simulator, Time Challenges, Scavenger Hunts, and a Survival mode. Teams for this port consist of three characters and a striker, a non-playable fourth character who can be summoned to perform a powerful attack directed toward on-screen enemies. 

Playable characters include Spider-Man, Wolverine, Iceman, Storm, Captain America, Deadpool, Elektra, Ms. Marvel, Thor, The Thing, and Ghost Rider. Special characters included in the game are Blade, Dr. Strange, Ghost Rider, Iron Man, Dark Phoenix, Namor the Sub-Mariner, and Vision. Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Iceman are the game's starter team but as the game progresses, characters become unlocked as more missions are completed.

=PC=
The PC version, like most PC games, is customizable, and many characters and their skins can be obtained from modding sites for play within the game. Also, the PC version's graphics vary depending on the customization of a user's settings. At maximum settings and shaders with premium hardware, the PC graphics will be similar to or better than the 7th generation console versions. The PC version also features &quot;intuitive mouse controls&quot; ;[http://www.marvelultimatealliance.com/game_info.php Marvel: Ultimate Alliance official site]; and works with a gamepad.

The PC version was quickly discontinued outside the US, and was virtually impossible to find in countries such as Australia less than a year after its release.

=Playstation Portable=
The PSP version features simplified graphics, different characters, and extra features including the four exclusive playable Marvel characters Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Hawkeyeand Ronin. Other things unique to this version are 6 exclusive comic book missions including one which contained Swordsman, an exclusive prequel mission, and three exclusive single-player gameplay modes. Added features include online play, microphone support ''(voice chat)'' and online-recordable player statistics.

=Wii=
The Wii version has a few features unique to its version including specific motion-sensitive controls for normal moves, Motion-sensitive controlled Special attacks, unique for each character, and access to any special move at any time. For this version there is no online play, but there is a normal multiplayer mode in which up to four players may play at once. It also features the characters Moon Knight and Colossus.

=Xbox 360 and PS3=
The Xbox 360 version and the Playstation 3 version are virtually identical, with no major differences apart from the PS3's SIXAXIS controller. Both versions feature the characters Moon Knight and Colossus.

Activision released 8 additional downloadable characters on the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Marketplace on April 26, 2007 in a set of packs: a hero and villain pack, both costing 500 Microsoft points each. However, if desired, the user may download both in a bundle pack, slightly reducing the overall cost of both separate for 800 Microsoft points. Four heroes are included, being Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. There are also four villains - Magneto, Sabretooth, Venom, and Doctor Doom. ;;

''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance: Gold Edition'' was released for the Xbox 360 on May 22, 2007. ;; It has all eight downloadable heroes and villains that were originally available only on the Xbox 360 through download on Xbox Live.

''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance: Special Edition (Platinum Hits)'' was released for the Xbox 360 on September 25, 2007. ;; The feature set includes all of the Gold Edition extras and a bonus DVD.

=PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits=
