The Chaser APEC pranks were comedic stunts which targeted the 2007 APEC Leaders Summit in Sydney, Australia. All of these pranks were planned, coordinated and performed by the Australian satire group The Chaser during September 2007, for their then current television program, ''The Chaser's War on Everything''. The most well-known and controversial of these stunts was the breach of an APEC restricted zone in the heart of Sydney's CBD on 6 September 2007. The stunt, which is easily the most publicized in the history of the comedy group, has received overwhelming criticism, recognition and acclaim, both locally and internationally.;

Overview of APEC

Logo for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
APEC Australia 2007 was composed of a series of political meetings held around Australia between the 21 member economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. These meetings culminated in Leaders Week, where the heads of government of each member economy attended Sydney, New South Wales from 2 to 9 September 2007.;

;
The significance of the APEC event meant that severe and expensive security arrangements were employed. Overall security planning was overseen by the ''Protective Security Coordination Centre'' (PSCC) of the ''National Security and Criminal Justice Group'' from the Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department, through the establishment of an APEC 2007 Security Branch (ASB).;

; In addition, the New South Wales Police Force formed the APEC Police Security Command (APSC) to secure and monitor the Leaders Summit. Notably, many public roads in Sydney were closed as leaders, officials and personnel and their motorcades travelled around the city.;
; Figures released by the government to a Senate committee show that security expenses at APEC accumulated to $170 million.;

;

Pre-APEC

Prior to the APEC event in September 2007, The Chaser had been warned about the dangers of behaving irresponsibly during the APEC lockdown in downtown Sydney.;

; David Campbell, the NSW police minister said that the police understood that &quot;parody and satire are entertaining and fun&quot;, however the program must understand the &quot;seriousness of this matter [APEC] and take caution&quot;. This was reiterated by a police statement, which said that producers of ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' were warned about the &quot;ramifications of stunts during APEC&quot;.;

The Chaser team however were not fazed by the advice and warnings on stunts at the event. Before the Leaders Summit, the executive producer of their current show Julian Morrow appeared on radio and commented that &quot;the eyes of the world and the eyes of Al-Qaeda are on us&quot; for the internationally political event.;
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022gQOHNNI0 ''Dangerous Fools''], YouTube video: Originally published on ''Today Tonight'', Seven Network. Date: 6 September 2007.
; Morrow also hinted on the general idea for their prank; that their challenge was to do a stunt that would &quot;make Osama bin Laden feel a little incompetent&quot;. This suggestion turned out to be true with their infamous breach of the prohibited zone, with a bin Laden look-alike hiding inside a car of the fake motorcade.

Breach of APEC restricted zone
On 6 September 2007, eight production members of ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' including executive producer Julian Morrow and regular on-screen cast member Chas Licciardello, and three hired chauffeurs drove a fake Canadian motorcade through the Sydney central business district and breached the APEC security zone.;

;

The motorcade began its journey into the fenced area, or so called &quot;ring of steel&quot;, after easily passing through the first security checkpoint, at the Bent and Macquarie Street intersection.;

; The vehicles then proceeded in a northerly direction, reaching the prohibited &quot;red zone&quot; where there was a second security checkpoint, just before the Bridge Street intersection. After they were waved through by the police officers, the team went further into the restricted area until stopping outside the InterContinental Hotel, where United States President George W. Bush was staying.

Julian Morrow, who was directing the stunt, ordered the motorcade to turn around because he realised that they had gotten further than expected, and the police officers were not going to stop them.;; Moments later, the crew members were arrested outside the hotel on Macquarie Street when Chas Licciardello, dressed as Osama bin Laden, stepped out of one of the cars and complained in-character about not being invited to the APEC Summit.;

The arrested crew members were immediately taken to Surry Hills Police Station, questioned and charged with entering a prohibited area, under the ''APEC Meeting (Police Powers) Act 2007''.;

;
Subsequently they were all released on bail to appear in court on 4 October 2007.;

; Under the new legislation, if the crew members are found guilty they each face a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment, or up to two years if they were in possession of a &quot;prohibited item&quot;.;

;

The stunt was planned and approved by ABC lawyers under the obvious assumption that the motorcade would be discovered and stopped at the first security checkpoint of the APEC restricted zone.;

; However, they managed to pass through two police security checkpoints, using a fake convoy of hired SUVs and a regular car, despite the fine print on the &quot;APEC 2007 Official Vehicle&quot; vehicle stickers stating: &quot;This vehicle belongs to a member of The Chaser's War on Everything. This dude likes trees and poetry and certain types of carnivorous plants excite him&quot;.;

;

The following episode of ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' on 12 September 2007 saw the team present an overview of their infamous stunt, using the footage shown to point out other obvious signs that the motorcade was a hoax.; Throughout the episode they repeatedly emphasized their only realistic attempt at actually disguising the vehicles – the use of a Canadian flag.; The video also showed that the bodyguards were running with camcorders and that the crew members' fake passes had the words &quot;JOKE&quot; and &quot;Insecurity&quot; printed quite clearly.;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Chaser_fake_apec_pass.jpg The Chaser's fake APEC pass]
; The footage also caught an officer telling Julian Morrow, regular cast member and the bodyguard supervising the stunt, &quot;you can do what you want, matey&quot;, while another commented &quot;the road's yours&quot;. In the episode, Morrow said that they had to stop themselves because it was pretty obvious that the security officers were not going to. After partially turning the motorcade, Chas Licciardello dressed as Osama bin Laden stepped out onto the street, and subsequently the police officers arrested the crew. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team in the episode, all the police officers initially chose to ignore Licciardello and only arrest Morrow.;

Aftermath

Following the breach of the APEC restricted area, The Chaser became the subject of intense scrutiny and judgement from members of the media, police officials and government ministers.

= Public response=

The stunt was mostly well-received by the general public, despite strong condemnations from various public officials. A Sydney correspondent to the BBC reported that the Chaser team had become 'folk heroes' after the prank.;

;
In addition, 87% of some 28,451 respondents to a web poll conducted by the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' found the stunt funny.;
[http://www.smh.com.au/polls/national/results.html Rate the Chaser stunt - Sydney Morning Herald Online Poll]
;
The ABC however, did receive more than 250 complaints, outweighing the 177 who sent in positive opinions on the prank.;

; A spokesperson from the national broadcaster said that the results were not accurate because people who enjoyed the show usually do not call them. In addition, talkback radio callers around the country were supportive of the Chaser by a significant (4:1) margin.; Notably, figures showed that the stunt was referred to in more than a third of radio calls on the topic of APEC.

= Political reactions=

There was plenty of negative criticism from the political front aimed at the program and its members following the incident. Among the most critical of The Chaser group over the motorcade prank were Sydney's police officials and personnel. NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione, the head for the lead security agency of APEC, publically said that he was furious at the stunt, because it could have resulted in the comedians being shot by snipers, who were &quot;clearly...there because they mean business. They're not there for show&quot;.;

;

In addition, many politicians, mostly from the ALP, treated the security breach with concern and unease. Police Minister David Campbell expressed disappointment and concern over the stunt, arguing that &quot;We've got 21 world leaders arriving in the city at the one time and it needs to be taken seriously&quot;.;

; Furthermore, NSW Premier Morris Iemma said that while he was a fan of the show, the people involved in the stunt would have to face the full force of the law.; Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd also voiced similar comments, saying that &quot;I'm a fan of The Chaser...but I think these guys have crossed the line&quot;.;

Despite the prominent negative criticism, Alexander Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs from the Liberal Party, appeared rather amused when asked to comment on the incident.;

; Downer also commented that the arrest of the crew members proved that the security system had functioned properly and effectively, and adding that &quot;whatever you think of the humour of The Chaser...they were clearly not going to harm anybody in a physical way&quot;.;

= International recognition=

Whilst extremely popular in Australia, the APEC security breach captured international attention and acclaim. In Canada, a local newspaper saw the humourous side of the incident, despite the pranksters posing as Canadian officials, and in the United States, there were mixed reviews in the media. News readers from CNN, FOX News, NBC and CBS either &quot;raised their eyebrows&quot; or &quot;had smiles on their faces over the stunt&quot;.;

;

= Current affairs=

On 6 September 2007, Current affairs program ''Today Tonight'' aired a story titled &quot;Dangerous Fools&quot; specifically describing the APEC stunt.; In the report, the program's host Anna Coren stated that The Chaser were wasting taxpayers money for the dangerous stunt, and will &quot;need more of those funds to defend their actions in court&quot;. Coren also claims that the ABC chiefs are too arrogant to reply to the program's questioning. A media commentator featured in the report labelled the APEC stunt as &quot;over the top&quot; and that he did not see the funny side of it at all. A security expert also presented his view, saying that there was a serious risk of not just the crew members, but also onlookers being seriously injured in the motorcade stunt, despite the fact that the breach was discovered by police officers well inside the prohibited zone. Furthermore, footage of David Campbell speaking to the media also featured on the report.

The broadcast also criticized the comedic group's approach to the APEC event, describing the stunt as &quot;stretch[ing] the boundaries yet again&quot;, and quoting Julian Morrow on radio, who said he wanted &quot;a stunt that can really hit the headlines across the world&quot;.; ''Today Tonight'' also showed fellow ''Chaser'' member Craig Reucassel being asked questions, simultaneously claiming that the comedy team were &quot;hardly sorry&quot; for their actions. Ironically, this story was reported by Dave &quot;Sluggo&quot; Richardson, notorious for the Today Tonight#Christopher Skase controversy|In Barcelona Tonight incident. Unlike Richardson, The Chaser crew actually did go through roadblocks in their stunt.

Moreover, rival current affairs program ''A Current Affair'' also broadcasted a report on the prank.;
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo2aUUFGDIg ''Chaser Busted''], YouTube video: Originally published on ''A Current Affair'', Nine Network. Date: 6 September 2007.
; It explained the story of a Channel Nine cameraman who happened to see the stunt in action, and managed to capture footage of the actual sketch. The report also revolved around the aspect of the incompetence of the police and security personnel, rather than ''Today Tonight's'' approach of attacking the crew members who performed the breach of the restricted area. It also centred on the idea of the comedy group executing &quot;their grandest gag yet&quot; – referring to the achievement of &quot;George W. Bush|the world's most powerful man and the world's most wanted, in the same place, at the same time&quot;.

= Legal action=

After arrest, questioning and interrogation by police officials, all eleven members of the crew involved in the stunt, including eight production members of ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' and three drivers, were charged with ''entering a restricted area without special justification'' under the ''APEC Meeting (Police Powers) Act 2007''.; All eleven were granted bail, on the condition that they do not enter any of the APEC secured areas, and ordered to appear at the Downing Centre Local Court on 4 October 2007.;

; Subsequently, this hearing and all matters were successfully adjourned until 5 December 2007 – a request from ABC lawyers.;

; The case was once again adjourned until January 2008, and police are now considering dropping the charges.;

;

= Show ratings=

With all the hype and media attention directed at this stunt, the following ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' episode on 12 September 2007, which initially intended to be broadcasted under an alternative name – ''The Chaser's War on APEC''; – ended up giving the program their highest ever ratings for a single episode, with 2.245 million viewers tuned in across Australia.;

; Furthermore, the stunning success made it the most watched ABC television program since 2000,;

; as well as being a significant improvement from the preceding episode (1.491 million national viewers), which incidentally was the first episode for the second half of the 2007 season.;

; The episode, which aired on 5 September 2007 and also was the highest ever ratings achieved in the history of the show until surpassed in the following week, featured many of the other minor APEC pranks.

After the high ratings for the episode, the program began screening overseas in countries such as Israel, South Korea and New Zealand, while other interested countries, especially in the Middle East, are currently negotiating with the ABC.;

= The Chaser's response=

After the successes of the APEC security breach, the comedic team used it to express their bewilderment at the incompetence of the police and security forces, whilst defending their own stunt. Cast members Julian Morrow and Craig Reucassel went on radio to explain their story further from their initial reactions in ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' episode. Morrow pointed out that while they did extensive planning on the stunt, the one thing they &quot;didn't plan for was success&quot;, and because of permission being granted unexpectedly for the motorcade to enter the secured area, the crew members were confused and not sure what to do in this unique situation. The duo also commented that while they clearly sensed danger being inside the prohibited area, the atmosphere was actually very quiet and subdued.;

;

Other stunts

Furthermore to the major APEC security breach mentioned above, the ''Chaser'' team also performed stunts related to the APEC Summit that were much less publicized in the media.

On 5 September 2007, Chris Taylor, mounted on a pantomime horse, confronted the police force who were on foot, and asked them if they needed any reinforcements to defend against APEC protesters. When his offer was refused, Taylor took the horse for a stroll anyway, and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel.; He was later asked to remove his clothing for examination by real police officers because he had been wearing similar police uniform, however no charges were laid.;

; In addition, this stunt was made in reference to the equine flu outbreak, which meant that the police officers at APEC had to fight against protesters on foot.;

;

On 7 September 2007, following the breach of the APEC security zone on the previous day, Chris Taylor, Craig Reucassel and Dominic Knight – all members of The Chaser, and their film crew were detained and questioned over a follow-up stunt.;

; It involved running near and attempting to enter the APEC protected zone dressed in cardboard cars topped with Canadian flags – a reference to its use in the motorcade as the primary disguise item. Police had no choice but to release all members involved in this stunt as they were outside the prohibited area.;

;

There were additional stunts relating to APEC shown on their weekly program ''The Chaser's War on Everything'', which did not attract media scrutiny.

* Craig Reucassel approached various APEC security personnel and offered a selection of clothing for the traditional official photograph of all the attending leaders.;

* In addition, as part of Hu Jintao's visit to Australia, Reucassel went to the Chinese Consulate and asked for them to Capital punishment in the People's Republic of China#Procedure|prepay the bullets he was going to use to assassinate the Chinese President.;

* Chas Licciardello, who was dressed as a police officer, performed random security checks and procedures on members of the public to demonstrate the glorification of the tough APEC security measures.; Procedures conducted included random frisking, taking hair samples, telling tram riders in Melbourne to stand and turn their heads, and erecting secure areas in public toilets and near escalators. When Licciardello was approached by real security officers, he said that all of these measures were &quot;classified&quot;.

* Licciardello also rang up a talkback radio station pretending to be someone else, and complained about the stunt, claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC should be put in jail for ten years.;

* Furthermore, Licciardello and Julian Morrow, the two charged members over the major prank, tried to enter an RSL using the same fake passes that worked in entering the restricted area. The manager did not let them enter, which according to the team proved that &quot;RSLs are harder to get into than APEC&quot;.;

* The Chaser team launched a rival fireworks display to coincide with the official APEC fireworks display, which was only to be viewed by the APEC officials.;

; The two fireworks were relatively close together, and the team also lit up a large screen with the text: &quot;Screw APEC&quot;.;

* Cast members dressed as Australian native animals went into Taronga Zoo and pretended to be real animals,; a reference to the temporary relocation of some animals for private viewing by APEC spouses.;
