Homer Jacobson is a former chemistry professor at Brooklyn College, New York City. 

In the 1950s he illustrated basic self-replication in artificial life with a model train set. A seed &quot;organism&quot; consisting of a &quot;head&quot; and &quot;tail&quot; boxcar could use the simple rules of the system to consistently create new &quot;organisms&quot; identical to itself, so long as there was a random pool of new boxcars to draw from.

In 1955 he published &quot;Information, Reproduction and the Origin of Life,&quot; in ''American Scientist''.In 2007, he retracted two passages of this work after realizing that errors in his paper were being misread as evidence for creationism.;;
