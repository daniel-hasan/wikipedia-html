''By the Way'' is the eighth studio album by American alternative rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on July 9, 2002 onWarner Bros. Records. It sold over 282,000 copies in the first week, and peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200.;;;; The singles from the album included &quot;By the Way&quot;, &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot;, &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, &quot;Dosed&quot; and &quot;Universally Speaking&quot;. The lyrical subject matter vocalist Anthony Kiedis addresses in ''By the Way'' is a divergence from previous Chili Peppers albums, with Kiedis taking a more candid and reflective approach to his lyricism.

''By the Way'' was applauded by critics as a departure from the band's previous styles, and is recognized for the melodic and subdued emotions given by the Chili Peppers.;;;; Guitarist John Frusciante is credited with writing most of the album's melodies, bass lines, and guitar progressions, therefore changing the direction of the recording dramatically: &quot;his warm, understated guitar work and his doo-wop style vocal harmonies are king this time around.&quot;;; ''By the Way'' contained virtually none of the signature punk-funk Music genre#Fusional origins|fusion the band had become known for playing.;; Frusciante considered writing &quot;''By the Way'' [to be] one of the happiest times in my life.&quot;;;

Background
Following a life threatening drug addiction that caused him to leave the Chili Peppers in 1992, Frusciante made a full recovery after a month of drug rehabilitation in the early months of 1998.;;;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 389–400; Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the Red Hot Chili Peppers.; After several months of writing and recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, ''Californication'' was released. The album went on to sell over fifteen million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording, to date.;; Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, ''One Hot Minute''.;;;;;; A two year long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances,including Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio.

The writing and formation of ''By the Way'' began immediately following the culmination of ''Californication's'' world tour, in the Spring of 2001. As with ''Californication'', much of the creation took place in the band members' homes, and other locations of practice, such as a recording studio stage.; Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 456 ; Kiedis recalled of the situation: &quot;We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it.&quot;; Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate together for days straight, discussing and sharing guitar progressions and lyrics.; Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 458; For Kiedis, &quot;writing ''By the Way''...was a whole different experience from ''Californication''. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence.&quot;;

Writing and composition
The album's guitar and bass ensemble was primarily dictated by Frusciante, rather than a collaborative effort between him and bassist Flea.;Anthony Kiedis and John Frusciante - By the Way promotional Interview; Amsterdam; Therefore the record took different direction than any previous Chili Peppers' album. Frusciante sought to create an emotional and poignant soundscape throughout the recording.; Drawing influences from musicians such as Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column and John McGeoch, Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on ''By the Way'', utilizing tools such as the mellotron and various effects pedals throughout.;

 
Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love.; Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 456–465; Songs such as &quot;Body of Water&quot;, &quot;Someone&quot; (both B-sides), &quot;By the Way&quot;, &quot;I Could Die for You&quot; and &quot;Warm Tape&quot; all digressed into the many sides of love.;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 454–456, 458, 463–469; Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he had only been sober since December 2000.; Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 433; Tracks like &quot;This Is the Place&quot;, &quot;Don't Forget Me&quot;, and &quot;Dosed&quot; expressed his intense dislike for narcotics and the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him. He referenced late Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in &quot;This Is the Place&quot;, and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: &quot;On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean&quot;. &quot;Venice Queen&quot; was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who diedshortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach.; It mourned her death as a painful loss: &quot;We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen.&quot;

''By the Way'' diverged from the band's previous styles, thus containing few funk-driven songs. &quot;Can't Stop&quot; was noted as the only song which revisited the Chili Peppers' once trademark style of short, rapped verses.;;;; &quot;Throw Away Your Television&quot;, while not having any rapidly sung lyrics, also contained a funk oriented bass line, though hinted at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus. Other &quot;experimental&quot; tracks include the trumpet based &quot;On Mercury&quot;, a centered largely on ska. &quot;Cabron&quot;, the only track to be played entirely on acoustic guitar, has visible Latin influences. &quot;Tear&quot; had a minor piano part, and &quot;Warm Tape&quot; was composed almost entirely on a keyboard. 

Technically, ''By the Way'' saw the Chili Peppers employing several devices to distort and alter guitar and vocal sequences. &quot;Don't Forget Me&quot; utilizes a mellotron, Wah-wah pedal|wah pedal, and echoing techniques to convey an emotive atmosphere, while Frusciante uses a Big Muff for the solos on &quot;Minor Thing&quot;.; Frusciante's backing vocals, although present in ''Californication'', became dominant in ''By the Way'', as almost every track contained his background presence.

Release
The group decided that they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album.;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 420; Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return.;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 230–232, 320–321, 344, 424; ''By the Way'' was released on CD and LP on July 9, 2002 under the Warner Bros. label. It was certified gold just a few months later on October 26, 2002.;;;; Five singles were released from it; of these, the title track &quot;By the Way&quot; was the most successful, peaking at #2 on the UK charts and #1 on the Billboard rock charts. 

Although the album sold fewer copies than ''Californication'', ''By the Way'' managed to peak at #2 on the Billboard Top 200,;;;; one spot higher than ''Californication''. Around the world, the album peaked at #1 on the UK Top 40,;; the Swiss, New Zealand, Austrian, and Swedish charts,;; and #2 on the French Top 40.; In March 2006, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums were made available for download from the iTunes Music Store.;; The albums included two previously unreleased tracks (&quot;Runaway&quot;, and &quot;Bicycle Song&quot;). The original album tracks were not remastered, although the bonus tracks were.

Critical reception
The album received a mostly positive reaction from critics, who praised ''By the Way'' for its melodic, multilayer and textured styles. All Music Guide's Zac Johnson said that the album was &quot;sophisticated...the Peppers have not sacrificed any of their trademark energy or passions for life, universal love, and (of course) lust&quot;.; ''Rolling Stone'' called the album &quot;insanely melodic&quot; and a &quot;near-perfect balance of gutter grime and high-art aspiration&quot;, comparing it to other works, such as The Beach Boys' album ''Pet Sounds''.; ''Mojo'' applauded the recording, and considered it to be &quot;the strongest Chili's album since 1991's ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''&quot;.;;;''Mojo Magazine''; 8/02 - Page 118.; Giving the album 5 stars out of 5, ''Q'' called ''By the Way'' &quot;A fantastic record; full of wonder.&quot;; ''Q Magazine'' August 2002, p.118&quot;; Kimberly Mack of ''Pop Matters'' commented on how the album &quot;...showcases a more sophisticated, lush sound that only today's Peppers could have conceived&quot;, and that &quot;Anthony Kiedis' lyrics are more personal than ever.&quot;; Frusciante was, in her eyes, &quot;a musical talent to be reckoned with and is the undeniable X factor in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound.&quot;;

However, the praise was balanced by those such as indie music critic Piero Scaruffi, who dismissed the album as being &quot;too mainstream&quot;.;; ''Blender'' considered ''By the Way'' to be an indistinguishable sequel to ''Californication'', calling it &quot;Californication 2&quot;. It further condemned the Chili Peppers for not varying their style and remaining extremely similar in sound.;;''Blender Magazine'' - No. 9, page 142.; Newspapers such as ''The Village Voice'' criticized the band for trying too hard to change.;; ''Entertainment Weekly'' praised ''By the Way'' for being well refined and a superb collaboration, but criticized the Chili Peppers for playing it safe and keeping the album's energy mild; for being &quot;more fascinating for what it symbolizes than what it is.&quot;;;

All Music Guide considered the song &quot;By the Way&quot; to combine &quot;fiery Hollywood funk, gentle harmonies, a little bit of singing about girls, [and] a little bit of hanging out in the streets in the summertime.&quot;; ''Rolling Stone'' commented on &quot;how close this band has come to conjuring pure California sunshine&quot; in &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot;.; &quot;Midnight&quot; was highly regarded by several sources. It was chosen as one of ''By the Ways &quot;All Music Guide Track Picks&quot;.; Kimberly Mack of Pop Matters considered it to have &quot;hippie-friendly lyrics&quot; and to &quot;evoke images of tie-dyed T-shirts and AM radio.&quot;; Mack also regarded &quot;Venice Queen&quot; as &quot;a masterpiece...Frusciante's backing vocals are hauntingly beautiful.&quot;;

''By the Way'' tour
Immediately following the release of ''By the Way'', the Chili Peppers embarked on a world tour to support the album. Beginning in Europe, they also played at events such as the Fuji Rock Festival and Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in between. The band eventually culminated their Europe leg of the tour in February 2003, and commenced the United States leg on May 1.;; Ending June 21, the Chili Peppers took a small hiatus before performing at Slane Castle on August 23, to a crowd of over 80,000.;; ''Live at Slane Castle'', the result of the concert, would become the Chili Peppers' second live DVD, after ''Off the Map''. 

Following several Japanese and Australian performances, the Red Hot Chili Peppers planned three nights at London's Hyde Park. Over 240,000 tickets were sold within hours, and roughly 80,000 people saw each show on June 19, 20, and 25, respectively.;; It became the highest grossing concert at a single venue in history, accumulating an estimated $17 million gross revenue.; Due to the success of the three shows, the band released their first live album ''Live in Hyde Park'' in Europe, Australia, Japan and New Zealand, excluding the United States.; Later that year, the Chili Peppers played for the 2004 Democratic National Convention in support of their political beliefs, with Kiedis saying &quot;Do what you gotta do&quot; at the end of the band's set.;; Finally, they played at the Rock am Ring festival as one of the final performances of the ''By the Way'' tour.

All paintings, photography and art direction is credited to Julian Schnabel and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The woman featured on the cover of ''By the Way'' is Stella Schnabel, Julian Schnabel's daughter and Frusciante's then-girlfriend.;''By the Way'' booklet, and liner notes;;; Several pages of the album's booklet, and single for &quot;By the Way&quot; contain paintings of a goat head. A somewhat blurry, black and white photograph of the band in a desolate field, and each band member individually, is also present. 

The majority of the booklet's artwork are various scenes of replica grass and plants, stars and indistinguishable objects, which appears to be a miniature pole, placed in dirt. Single covers for &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot; and &quot;Can't Stop&quot; both feature this same background, although angled slightly differently. The lyrics for ''By the Way'' are placed on top of the landscape, hand written by Kiedis in pink lettering.;
