Quebec ( or ), in French, Québec (;) is a province in Canada, and the only province that is the homeland of a people recognized as a nation by the House of Commons.;[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=hansard&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=2544166&amp;File=0#SOB-1798651 Hansard; 39th Parliament, 1st Session; No. 087; November 27, 2006];

Quebec is bordered to the west by Ontario, James Bay and Hudson Bay, to the north by Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay, to the east by the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Labrador, to the southeast by New Brunswick and Maine, and to the south by the U.S. state|states of New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire.It also shares maritime borders with the Territory of Nunavut and the provinces of Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. 

Quebec is Canada's largest province by area and its second-largest Canada#Administrative divisions|administrative division; only the territory of Nunavut is larger. It is the second most populated province, behind Ontario, and most of its inhabitants live along or close to the banks of the Saint Lawrence River. The central and north portion of the province is sparsely populated and inhabited by the aboriginal peoples of Canada. Quebec operates North America's largest and most extensive civil service.

The official language of Quebec is French; it is the sole Canadian province whose population is mainly francophone, and where English is not an official language at the provincial level except in the legislature and the courts, where it is co-equal. Quebec has a strong and active nationalist movement, and has had referendums on independence in 1980 and 1995.
While the province's substantial natural resources have long been the mainstay of its economy, Quebec has adapted itself to function effectively in sectors of the knowledge economy such as: information and communication technologies, aerospace, biotechnology, and health industries.

Etymology and boundary changes
Samuel de Champlain, Father of New France
The name &quot;Quebec&quot;, which comes from a Míkmaq word meaning &quot;strait, narrows&quot;, originally referred to the area around Quebec City where the Saint Lawrence River narrows to a cliff-lined gap. Early variations in the spelling of the name included ''Québecq'' (Levasseur, 1601) and ''Kébec'' (Lescarbot 1609).;Afable, Patricia O. and Madison S. Beeler (1996). &quot;Place Names&quot;. In &quot;Languages&quot;, ed. Ives Goddard. Vol. 17 of ''Handbook of North American Indians'', ed. William C. Sturtevant. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 191;. French explorer Samuel de Champlain chose ''Québec'' in 1608 for the colonial outpost he would use as the administrative seat for the French colony of Canada and New France. ;;. 

The Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec was founded in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 after the Treaty of Paris formally transferred the French colony of New France to Britain after the Seven Years' War. It restricted the province to an area along the banks of the Saint Lawrence River. The Quebec Act of 1774 expanded the territory of the province to include the Great Lakes and the Ohio River Valley. The Treaty of Versailles, 1783ceded territories south of the Great Lakes to the United States. After the Constitutional Act of 1791, the territory was divided between Lower Canada (present day Quebec) andUpper Canada (present day Ontario), with each being granted an elected Legislative Assembly. In 1840, these become Canada East and Canada West after the British Parliament unified Upper and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada. This territory was redivided into the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario at Confederation in 1867. Each became one of the first four provinces. 

In 1870, Canada purchased Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company and over the next few decades the Parliament of Canada transferred portions of this territory to Quebec that would more than triple the size of the province.;Library of the Parliament of Canada, [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp412-e.htm#B].; In 1898, the Canadian Parliament passed the first Quebec Boundary Extension Act that expanded the provincial boundaries northward to include the lands of the aboriginal Cree. This was followed by the addition of the District of Ungava through the Quebec Boundaries Extension Act of 1912 that added the northernmost lands of the aboriginal Inuit to create the modern Province of Quebec.

Geography

Satellite view of three Monteregian Hills (Saint Bruno, Mont-Saint-Hilaire|Saint Hilaire, and Rougemont) in Saint Lawrence Valley.
The province occupies a vast territory (nearly three times the size of France), most of which is very sparsely populated. Quebec's highest point is Mont D'Iberville, which is located on the border with Newfoundland and Labrador in the northeastern part of the province.

The most populated region is the Saint Lawrence River valley in the south, where the capital, Quebec City, and the largest city, Montreal, are situated. The region is low-lying and flat, except for isolated igneous outcrops near Montreal called the Monteregian Hills.The combination of rich and easily arable soils and Quebec's warmest climate make the valley Quebec's most prolific agricultural area. A distinctive landscape is divided into narrow rectangular tracts of land that date back to settlement patterns in 17th century New France. The river is one of the worlds largest, sustaining large inland Atlantic ports atMontreal, Trois-Rivières, and Quebec City.The Saint Lawrence Seaway provides a link between the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Great Lakes starting at the Saint-Lambert, Quebec|Saint-Lambert locks in Montreal. 

Robert-Bourassa Dam, part of James Bay Project on Canadian Shield.
More than 90 percent of Quebec's area lies within the Canadian Shield, a rough, rocky terrain sculpted and scraped clean of soil by successive ice ages. It is rich in the mineral and hydro-electric resources that are a mainstay of the Quebec economy. In the Labrador Peninsula portion of the Shield, the far northern region of Nunavik includes the Ungava Peninsula and consists of Arctic tundra inhabited mostly by the Inuit. Further south lie subarctic taiga and boreal forest, where spruce, fir, andpoplar trees provide raw materials for Quebec's pulp and paper and lumber industries. Although inhabited principally by the Cree, Naskapi, and Innu First Nations, thousands of temporary workers reside at Radisson to service the massive James Bay Hydroelectric Project on the La Grande and Eastmain rivers. The southern portion of the shield extends to theLaurentians, a mountain range just north of Montreal and Quebec City that attracts local and international tourists to ski hills and lakeside resorts.

The tree-covered Appalachian Mountains flank the eastern portion of the province, extending from New England into the Eastern Townships, northeastward through the Beauce region, and on to the Gaspé Peninsula, where they disappear into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This region sustains a mix of forestry, industry, and tourism based on its natural resources and landscape.

Climate
Quebec has three main climate regions. Southern and western Quebec, including most of the major population centres, have a humid continental climate (Koppen climate classification ''Dfb'') with warm, humid summers and long, cold winters. The main climatic influences are from western and northern Canada which move eastward and from the southern and central United States that move northward. Due to the influence of both storm systems from the core of North America and the Atlantic Ocean, precipitation is abundant throughout the year, with most areas receiving more than 1,000 mm (40 inches) of precipitation, including over 300 cm (120 inches) of snow in many areas. Severe summer weather (such as tornadoes and severe thunderstorms) are far less common than in southern Ontario, although they occasionally occur.

Most of central Quebec has a subarctic climate (Koppen ''Dfc''). Winters are long and among the coldest in eastern Canada, while summers are warm but very short due to the higher latitude and the greater influence of Arctic air masses. Precipitation is also somewhat less than farther south, except at some of the higher elevations.

The northern regions of Quebec have an arctic climate (Koppen ''ET''), with very cold winters and short, much cooler summers. The primary influences in this region are the Arctic Ocean currents (such as the Labrador Current) and continental air masses from the High Arctic.

History

=First Nations: before 1500=
At the time of first European contact and later colonization, Algonquian, Iroquoian and Inuit groups were the peoples that inhabited what is now Québec. Their lifestyles and cultures reflected the land on which they lived. Seven Algonquian groups lived nomadic lives based on hunting, gathering, and fishing in the rugged terrain of the Canadian Shield: (James Bay Cree, Innu, Algonquins) and Appalachian Mountains (Mi'kmaq, Abenaki). St. Lawrence Iroquoians lived more settled lives, planting squash and maize in the fertile soils of St. Lawrence Valley. The Inuit continue to fish, whale, and seal in the harsh Arctic climate along the coasts of Hudson and Ungava Bay. These peoples traded fur and food, and sometimes warred with each other.

=Early European exploration: 1500=
Basque whalers and fishermen traded furs with Saguenay natives throughout the 1500s. [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0000550]

The first French explorer to reach Quebec was Jacques Cartier, who planted a cross either in Gaspé in 1534 or at Old Fort Bay on the Lower North Shore. He sailed into the St. Lawrence River in 1535 and established an ill-fated colony near present-day Quebec City at the site of Stadacona, an Iroquoian village.

=New France=


Samuel de Champlain was part of a 1603 expedition from France that traveled into the St. Lawrence River. In 1608, he returned as head of an exploration party and founded Quebec City with the intention of making the area part of the French colonial empire. Champlain's ''Habitation de Quebec'', built as a permanent fur trading outpost, was where he would forge a trading, and ultimately a military alliance, with the Algonquin and Huron nations. Natives traded their furs for many French goods such as metal objects, guns, alcohol, and clothing.

Hélène Desportes, born July 7, 1620, to the French habitants (settlers) Pierre Desportes and his wife Françoise Langlois, was the first child of European descent born in Quebec.

From Quebec, coureurs des bois, coureur des bois#Voyageurs|voyageurs and Catholic missionaries used river canoes to explore the interior of the North American continent, establishing fur trading forts on the Great Lakes (Étienne Brûlé 1615), Hudson Bay (Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers|Groseilliers 1659-60), Ohio River and Mississippi River (La Salle 1682), as well as the Prairie River and Missouri River (Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de la Vérendrye|de la Verendrye 1734-1738). 

After 1627, King Louis XIII of France introduced the seigneurial system and forbade settlement in New France by anyone other than Roman Catholics. Sulpician and Jesuit clerics founded missions in Trois-Rivières, Quebec|Trois-Rivières (Laviolette) and Montréal or Ville-Marie (Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve and Jeanne Mance) to convert New France's Huron and Algonkian allies to Catholicism. The seigneurial system of governing New France also encouraged immigration from the motherland.

New France became a Royal Province in 1663 under King Louis XIV of France with a Sovereign Council that included intendant Jean Talon. This ushered in a golden era of settlement and colonization in New France, including the arrival of les &quot;Filles du Roi&quot;. The population would grow from about 3,000 to 60,000 people between 1666 and 1760. Colonists built farms on the banks of St. Lawrence River and called themselves &quot;Canadiens&quot; or &quot;Habitants&quot;. The colony's total population was limited, however, by a winter climate significantly harsher than that found in France; by the spread of diseases; and by the refusal of the French crown to allow Huguenots, or French Protestants, to settle there. The population of New France lagged far behind that of the 13 Colonies to the south, leaving it vulnerable to attack.

=Conquest of New France=
In 1753 France began building a series of forts in the British Ohio Country. They refused to leave after being notified by the British Governor and, in 1754, George Washington launched an attack on the French Fort Duquesne (now Pittsburgh) in the Ohio Valley in an attempt to enforce the British claim to the territory. This frontier battle set the stage for the French and Indian War in North America. By 1756, France and Britain were battling the Seven Years' War worldwide. In 1758, the British mounted an attack on New France by sea and took the French fort at Louisbourg. 

On 13 September 1759, General James Wolfe defeated General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm on the Plains of Abraham outside Quebec City. France ceded its North American possessions to Great Britain through the Treaty of Paris (1763). By the British Royal Proclamation of 1763, Canada (part of New France) was renamed the Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec.

In 1774, fearful that the French-speaking population of Quebec (as the colony was now called) would side with the rebels of the Thirteen Colonies to the south, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act giving recognition to French law, Catholic religion and French language in the colony; before that Catholics had been excluded from public office and recruitment of priests and brothers forbidden, effectively shutting down Quebec's schools and colleges. The first British policy of assimilation (1763-1774) was deemed a failure. Both the petitions and demands of the Canadiens' élites, and Governor Guy Carleton, played an important role in convincing London to drop the assimilation scheme, but the looming American revolt was certainly a factor. Through the Quebec Act, the Quebec people obtained their first Charter of Rights, which paved the way to later official recognition of the French language and French culture. The Act allowed ''Canadiens'' to maintain French civil law and sanctioned freedom of religious, allowing the Roman Catholic Church to remain. It also restored the Ohio Valley to Quebec, reserving the territory for the fur trade.

The Act, designed to placate one North American colony, had the opposite effect among its neighbors to the south. The Quebec Act was among the Intolerable Acts that infuriated American colonists, who launched the American Revolution. A 1775 invasion by the American Continental Army met with early success, but was later repelled at Quebec City.

=The Revolutionary War=

When the American army came to Quebec they found many sympathetic supporters. According to Baby, Tachereau and Williams, as many as 747 people in Quebec took up active service with the Americans, most notably Clément Gosselin of the 2nd Canadian Regiment.

The 2nd Canadian Regiment fought at the Battle of Brandywine in 1777. The 1st Canadian Regiment under James Livingston served at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777.

At the end of the war, 50,000 Loyalists came to Canada and settled amongst a population of 90,000 French people. 

The American Revolutionary War was ultimately successful in winning independence for the Thirteen Colonies. In the Treaty of Paris (1783), the British ceded their territory south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States of America.

=The ''Patriotes Rebellion in Lower and Upper Canada=

Like their counterparts in Upper Canada, in 1837 English and French speaking residents of Lower Canada, led by Louis-Joseph Papineau and Robert Nelson, formed an armed resistance group to seek an end to British colonial rule. They made a Declaration of Rights with equality for all citizens without discrimination, and a Declaration of Independence in 1838. Their actions resulted in rebellions in both Lower and Upper Canada. An unprepared British Army had to raise a local militia force and the rebel forces were soon defeated after having scored a victory in Saint-Denis, Quebec, east of Montreal. The British army also burned the Church of St-Eustache, killing the rebels who were hiding within it.The bullet and cannonball marks on the walls of the church are still visible to this day.

= Act of Union=
After the rebellions, Lord Durham was asked to undertake a study and prepare a report on the matter and to offer a solution for the British Parliament to assess.

The final report recommended that the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada be united, and that the French speaking population of Lower Canada be assimilated into British culture. Following Durham's Report, the British government merged the two colonial provinces into one Province of Canada in 1840 with the Act of Union.

However, the political union proved contentious. Reformers in both Canada West (formerly Upper Canada) and Canada East (formerly Lower Canada) worked to repeal limitations on the use of the French language in the Legislature. The two colonies remained distinct in administration, election, and law.

In 1848, Baldwin and LaFontaine, allies and leaders of the Reformist party, were asked by Lord Elgin to form an administration together under the new policy of responsible government.The French language subsequently regained legal status in the Legislature.

= Canadian Confederation=
In the 1860s, the delegates from the colonies of British North America (Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland) met in a series of conferences to discuss self-governing status for a new confederation.

The first Charlottetown Conference took place in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island followed by the Quebec Conference in Quebec City which led to a delegation going to London, England to put forth a proposal for a national union.

As a result of those deliberations, in 1867 the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the British North America Act, providing for the Confederation of most of these provinces.

The former Province of Canada was divided into its two previous parts as the provinces of Ontario (Upper Canada) and Quebec (Lower Canada).
* New Brunswick and Nova Scotia joined Ontario and Quebec in the new Dominion of Canada.
* Prince Edward Island joined in 1873 and the Dominion of Newfoundland entered the Confederation in 1949.

=The &quot;Quiet Revolution&quot;=

The conservative government of Maurice Duplessis and his Union Nationale dominated Quebec politics from 1944 to 1960 with the support of the Roman Catholic church. Pierre Elliot Trudeau and other liberals formed an intellectual opposition to Duplessis's regime, setting the groundwork for the Quiet Revolution under Jean Lesage's Parti libéral du Québec|Liberals. The Quiet Revolution was a period of dramatic social and political change that saw the decline of Anglo supremacy in the Quebec economy, the decline of the Roman Catholic Church's influence, the nationalization of hydro-electric companies under Hydro-Québec and the emergence of a pro-sovereignty movement under former Liberal minister René Lévesque.

Beginning in 1963, a terrorist group that became known as the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) launched a decade of bombings, robberies and attacks ;[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0003082 Front de libération du Québec] from the Canadian Encyclopedia; directed primarily at English institutions, resulting in at least five deaths. In 1970, their activities culminated in events referred to as the October Crisis [http://www.mcgill.ca/maritimelaw/history/crisis/] when James Cross, the British trade commissioner to Canada, was kidnapped along with Pierre Laporte, a provincial minister and Vice-Premier, who was murdered a few days later. In their published Manifesto, the terrorists stated:&quot;In the coming year Bourassa (Quebec Premier) will have to face reality; 100,000 revolutionary workers, armed and organized.&quot;

At the request of Premier Robert Bourassa, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoked the War Measures Act. In addition, the Quebec Ombudsman [http://www.protecteurducitoyen.qc.ca/en/index.asp], Louis Marceau, was instructed to hear complaints of detainees and the Quebec government agreed to pay damages to any person unjustly arrested (only in Quebec). On February 3, 1971, John Turner, the Minister of Justice of Canada, reported that 497 persons had been arrested throughout Canada under the War Measures Act, of whom 435 had been released. The other 62 were charged, of which 32 were crimes of such seriousness that a Quebec Superior Court judge refused them bail. The crisis ended a few weeks after the death of Pierre Laporte at the hands of his captors. The fallout of the crisis marked the zenith and twilight of the FLQ which lost membership and public support. 

In 1977, the newly elected Parti Québécois government of René Lévesque introduced the Charter of the French Language. Often known as Bill 101, it defined French as the only official language of Quebec in areas of provincial jurisdiction.

=The Parti Québécois and constitutional crisis=
Lévesque and his party had run in the 1970 and 1973 Quebec elections under a platform of separating Quebec from the rest of Canada. The party failed to win control of Quebec's National Assembly both times &amp;mdash; though its share of the vote increased from 23% to 30% &amp;mdash; and Lévesque himself was defeated both times in the riding he contested. In the 1976 election, he softened his message by promising a referendum (plebiscite) on sovereignty-association rather than outright separation, by which Quebec would have independence in most government functions but share some other ones, such as a common currency, with Canada. On November 15, 1976, Lévesque and the Parti Québécois won control of the provincial government for the first time. The question of sovereignty-association was placed before the voters in the 1980 Quebec referendum. During the campaign, Pierre Trudeau promised that a vote for the NO side was a vote for reforming Canada. Trudeau advocated the patriation of Canada's Constitution from the United Kingdom. The existing constitutional document, the British North America Act, could only be amended by the United Kingdom Parliament upon a request by the Canadian parliament.

Sixty percent of the Quebec electorate voted against the proposition. Polls showed that the overwhelming majority of English and immigrant Quebecers voted against, and that French Quebecers were almost equally divided, with older voters less in favour, and younger voters more in favour. After his loss in the referendum, Lévesque went back to Ottawa to start negotiating a new constitution with Trudeau, his minister of Justice Jean Chrétien and the nine other provincial premiers. Lévesque insisted Quebec be able to veto any future constitutional amendments. The negotiations quickly reached a stand-still. 

Then on the night of November 4, 1981 (widely known in Quebec as ''La nuit des longs couteaux'' and in the rest of Canada as the Patriation#The Kitchen Accord|&quot;Kitchen Accord&quot;, Federal Justice Minister Jean Chretien; met with all of the provincial premiers except René Lévesque to sign the document that would eventually become the new Canadian constitution. The next morning, they presented the &quot;fait accompli&quot; to Lévesque. Lévesque refused to sign the document, and returned to Quebec. In 1982, Trudeau had the new constitution approved by the British Parliament, with Quebec's signature still missing (a situation that persists to this day). The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed Trudeau's assertion that every province's approval is not required to amend the constitution.

In subsequent years, two attempts were made to gain Quebec's approval of the constitution. The first was the Meech Lake Accord of 1987, which was finally abandoned in 1990 when the provinces of Manitoba and Newfoundland refused to support it. This led to the formation of the sovereignist Bloc Québécois party in Ottawa under the leadership of Lucien Bouchard, who had resigned from the federal cabinet. The second attempt, the Charlottetown Accord of 1992, was rejected by 56.7% of all Canadians and 57% of Quebecers. This result caused a split in the Parti libéral du Québec|Quebec Liberal Party that led to the formation of the new Action Démocratique (Democratic Action) party led by Mario Dumont and Jean Allaire.

On October 30, 1995, with the Parti Québécois back in power since 1994, a second referendum on sovereignty took place. This time, it was rejected by a slim majority (50.6% NO to 49.4% YES); a clear majority of French-speaking Quebecers voted in favour of sovereignty.

The referendum was enshrouded in controversy. Federalists complained that an unusually high number of ballots had been rejected in pro-federalist areas, notably in the largely Jewish and Greek riding of Chomedey (11.7 % or 5,500 of its ballots were spoiled, compared to 750 or 1.7% in the general election of 1994) although Quebec's chief electoral officer found no evidence of outright fraud. The Government of Canada was accused of not respecting provincial laws with regard to spending during referendums (leading to a corruption scandal that would become public a decade later, greatly damaging the Liberal Party's standing), and to having accelerated the naturalization of immigrant people living in the province of Quebec (43,850 immigrants were naturalized in 1995, whereas the average number between 1988 and 1998 was 21,733).

The same night of the referendum, an angry Jacques Parizeau, then premier and leader of the &quot;Yes&quot; side, declared that the loss was due to &quot;money and the ethnic vote&quot;. Parizeau resigned over public outrage and as per his commitment to do so in case of a loss. Lucien Bouchard became Quebec's new premier in his place.

Federalists accused the sovereignist side of asking a vague, overly complicated question on the ballot. Its English text read as follows:
;
''Do you agree that Québec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of Québec and of the agreement signed on June 12, 1995?''
;
After winning the next election, Bouchard retired from politics in 2001. Bernard Landry was then appointed leader of the Parti Québécois and premier of Quebec. In 2003, Landry lost the election to the Parti Libéral du Québec|Quebec Liberal Party and Jean Charest. Landry stepped down as PQ leader in 2005, and in a crowded race for the party leadership, André Boisclair was elected to succeed him. The PQ has promised to hold another referendum should it return to government.

=Quebec as a nation=
Given the province's heritage and the preponderance of French (unique among the Canadian provinces), there is an ongoing debate in Canada regarding the status of Quebec and/or its people (wholly or partially).Prior attempts to amend the Canadian constitution to acknowledge Quebec as a 'distinct society' – referring to the province's uniqueness within Canada regarding law, language, and culture – have been unsuccessful; however, the federal government under prime minister Jean Chrétien would later endorse recognition of Quebec as a distinct society.On October 30, 2003, the National Assembly of Quebec voted unanimously to affirm &quot;that the Quebecers form a nation&quot;.;;
On November 27 2006, the House of Commons passed a motion moved by prime minister Stephen Harper declaring that &quot;this House recognize[s] that the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada.&quot;;[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=hansard&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=2544166&amp;File=0#SOB-1798651 Hansard; 39th Parliament, 1st Session; No. 087; November 27, 2006];;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061128.wnation28/BNStory/National/home Galloway, Gloria; Curry, Bill; Dobrota, Alex; ''Globe and Mail'': 'Nation' motion passes, but costs Harper; November 28, 2006];;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061127.wchong1127/BNStory/National Bonoguore, Tenille; Sallot, Jeff; ''Globe and Mail'': Harper's Quebec motion passes easily; November 27, 2006];, although there is considerable debate and uncertainty over what this means.;;;;

Government


The Lieutenant Governor represents Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. The head of government is the Premier (called ''premier ministre'' in French) who leads the largest party in the unicameral National Assembly or ''Assemblée Nationale'', from which the Council of Ministers is appointed.

Until 1968, the Quebec legislature was bicameral, consisting of the Legislative Counciland the Legislative Assembly. In that year the Legislative Council was abolished, and the Legislative Assembly was renamed the National Assembly. Quebec was the last province to abolish its legislative council.

The government of Quebec awards an order of merit called the National Order of Quebec. It is inspired in part by the French Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honour. It is conferred upon men and women born or living in Quebec (but non-Quebecers can be inducted as well) for outstanding achievements.

Administrative subdivisions


Quebec has subdivisions at the regional, supralocal and local levels. Excluding administrative units reserved for Aboriginal lands, the primary types of subdivision are:

At the regional level:
*17 administrative regions.
At the supralocal level:
*86 regional county municipalities or RCMs (''municipalités régionales de comté'', ''MRC''); 
*2 metropolitan communities (''communautés métropolitaines'').
At the local level:
*1,117 local municipalities of various types;
*11 agglomerations (''agglomérations'') grouping 42 of these local municipalities;
*within 8 local municipalities, 45 boroughs (''arrondissements'').

Economy

Montreal, North America's Francophone metropolis

;The St. Lawrence River Valley is a fertile agricultural region, producing dairy products, fruit, vegetables, foie gras, maple syrup (Quebec is the world's largest producer), and livestock.;

North of the St. Lawrence River Valley, the territory of Quebec is extremely rich in resources in its coniferous forests, lakes, and rivers—pulp and paper, lumber, and hydroelectricity are still some of the province's most important industries.

High-tech industries are very important around Montreal. It includes the aerospace companies like aircraft manufacturer Bombardier, the jet engine company Pratt &amp; Whitney, the flight simulator builder CAE and defence contractor Lockheed Martin, Canada. Those companies and other major subcontractors make Quebec the fourth biggest player worldwide in the aviation industry. In the video game industry, large video game companies like Electronic Arts and Ubisoft have studios in Montreal;http://theconsolewars.blogspot.com/2005/11/montreal-and-revolution.html;.

Culture

Quebec is the largest French-speaking society in the Americas. Most French Canadians live in Quebec, though there are other concentrations.

Demographics

Quebec's fertility rate is now lower than the Canadian average. At 1.52, it is slightly below the Canada-wide rate of 1.54;http://cansim2.statcan.ca/cgi-win/CNSMCGI.PGM; and well below the replacement fertility rate of 2.1. This contrasts with fertility rates before 1960, which were among the highest of any industrialized society.

Although Quebec represents only 23.5% of the population of Canada, the number of international adoptions in Quebec is the highest of all provinces of Canada. In 2001, 42% of international adoptions in Canada were carried out in Quebec.

In 2006, Quebec's population was overtaken by the combined population of Alberta and British Columbia.

National symbols;http://www.drapeau.gouv.qc.ca/ Justice Québec - Drapeauet et symboles nationaux ;
The Fleurdelisé leads a ship to harbour near Quebec City.

= Coat of Arms=
In 1939, the government of Quebec unilaterally ratified its coat of arms to reflect Quebec's political history: French rule (gold lily on blue background),British rule (lion on red background) and Canadian rule (maple leaves) and with Quebec's motto below &quot;Je me souviens&quot;.

= Motto=

''Je me souviens'' (&quot;I remember&quot;) was first carved under the coat of arms of Quebec's Parliament Building façade in 1883. It is an official part of the coat of arms and has been the official license plate motto since 1978, replacing &quot;''La belle province''&quot; (the beautiful province).The expression ''La belle province'' is still used mostly in tourism as a nickname for the province.

= Flag=

The fleur-de-lis, the ancient symbol of the French monarchy, first arrived on the shores of the Gaspésie in 1534 with Jacques Cartier on his first voyage. In 1900, Quebec finally sought to have its own uniquely designed flag. By 1903, the parent of today's flag had taken shape, known as the &quot;''Fleurdelisé''&quot;. The flag in its present form with its 4 white &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; lilies on a blue background with a white cross replaced the Union Jack on Quebec's Parliament Building on January 21 1948.

= Three official emblems=
The government of Quebec recognises three official emblems:
*The floral emblem of Quebec is the ''Iris versicolor''. Its colours reflect Quebec's cultural diversity and recognises the important role of water in nature's balance. It was formerly the Madonna lily, to recall the fleur-de-lis, but has been changed to the iris, which is native to Quebec. 
The ''harfang des neiges'' (snowy owl), official bird of Quebec.
*The avian emblem of Quebec issince 1987 the snowy owl. It represents Quebec's white winters, vast territory and rooting in a semi-Nordic climate.
*An official tree, the yellow birch (''bouleau jaune'', ''merisier''), symbolises the importance Quebecers give to the forests. It's known for the variety of its uses and commercial value, as well as its beautiful autumn colours.

In 1998 the Montreal Insectarium sponsored a poll to propose an official insect that saw the butterfly White Admiral (''Limenitis arthemis'') [http://www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/insectarium/toile/info_insectes/fiches/fic_fiche08_amiral.htm] win with 32&amp;nbsp;% of the 230&amp;nbsp;660 votes against the Spotted lady beetle (''Coleomegilla maculata lengi''), the Ebony Jewelwing damselfly (''Calopteryx maculata''), a species of bumble bee (''Bombus impatiens'') and the six-spotted tiger beetle (''Cicindela sexguttata sexguttata''). The [http://www.mddep.gouv.qc.ca/ministere/inter_en.htm Ministère du Développement durable, de l’Environnement et des Parcs] supports and finances actions to officially recognize the White Admiral as the insect emblem.

= Quebec's National Holiday=

In 1977, then premier René Lévesque declared June 24 to be Quebec's National Holiday. Historically June 24 was a holiday honouring one of Quebec's patron saints, St. John the Baptist, which is why it is commonly known as ''La Saint-Jean-Baptiste'' (often shortened to ''La St-Jean''). On this day, the song &quot;Gens du pays&quot; by Gilles Vigneault is often heard and commonly regarded as Quebec's unofficial anthem.
