British Rail reserved the TOPS Class 97 designation for departmental locomotives, which were used for special or engineering duties.They were therefore of several different classes, lumped together for numbering purposes. Some locomotives were converted from redundant engines, whilst others were purpose built.

Allocation of numbers
Class 97 numbers were allocated in one of three ways:
* Application of 97 prefix to pre-TOPS number - e.g. Western Region shunters PWM 650-654 became 97650- 97654.
* TOPS class number replaced by 97 prefix - e.g. Former Class 47 locomotive 47472 became 97472.
* Allocation of number in a series commencing from 97x01, where x represented the engine power Type (1 to 5), '7' for ex-multiple unit conversions and '8' for diesel shunters.

Locomotive descriptions
=97020=
This locomotive, formerly numbered 20 in the Western Region departmental locomotive series, was purpose-built by Ruston &amp; Hornsby in 1957 for use by the Signalling &amp; Telecommunications division in Reading. It carried its Class 97 number from 1980, but was withdrawn in 1981 and scrapped the following year.

=97201=

This locomotive was a former Class 24 locomotive, which was taken over by the Railway Technical Centre, based at Derby, in 1975. It was initially numbered RDB 968007, and was given its Class 97 number in 1979. It was employed hauling various test-trains until retirement in 1988. It was painted in RTC's distinctive red/blue livery, and named &quot;''Experiment''&quot;. After withdrawal it was preserved on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.

=97202=
This was a former Class 25 locomotive used for training purposes at Toton depot. Subsequently, other training locomotives were numbered in the ADB 968xxx series.

=97203-204=
image:97203_ex_31298_Bescot_-_5th_August_1987.jpg|thumb|97203 at Bescot 5 August 1987.
These locomotives were converted from Class 31 locomotives. The first, no. 97203, was operated by the Railway Technical Centre, based at Derby. It was used to haul various test-trains operated by the centre. However, in 1987, the locomotive was written-off after having sustained fire damage. Therefore, a replacement in the form of 97204 was converted. This later returned to normal traffic, as no. 31970. Both locomotives were painted in RTC's red/cream livery with a black bodyside band.

=97250-252=
Three former Class 25 locomotives were converted for use as mobile generators to provide electric heating on trains where the hauling locomotive could not supply this. They were referred to as ETHEL units (Electric Train Heating Ex-Locomotives), and unofficially named Ethel 1, Ethel 2 and Ethel 3. They were painted in a blue/grey livery in an effort to match the coaching stock livery of the day, but this was not too successful. All three have since been scrapped.

=97401-402=
This Class 46 'Peak' locomotive was bought by the Railway Technical Centre, based at Derby, straight from British Rail service in 1984. This locomotive did not receive its allocated departmental number of 97401, and retained it original number of 46009. It was used in a high-publicity test, to prove the safety of rail transported nuclear flasks. The locomotive was deliberately crashed into a container at 100 mph. Whilst the engine was written-off, the flask was undamaged.

A second locomotive, no. 46023, was allocated the departmental number 97402. It was cannibalised for spare parts, to allow no. 46009 to reach the required 100 mph, since Class 46 locomotives are usually restricted to 90 mph.

=97403-404=
image:97403_Coalville_Open_Day_-_1st_September_er.jpg|thumb|right|97403 Coalville Open Day 1st September 1985.
These two locomotives were converted from Class 46 locomotives. They were operated by the Railway Technical Centre at Derby. Number 97403 was named &quot;''Ixion''&quot;, and was used to evaluate wheelslip. It was painted in RTC's red/blue livery. Number 97404 was used as a source of spare parts. Both locomotives have been preserved.

=97405-408=
These four locomotives were renumbered from Class 40 locomotives, which had all recently been withdrawn from normal traffic. In 1985, they were returned to use and employed on engineering trains around Crewe. A major scheme was in progress to remodel the railways around the station. After these duties finished, the locomotives were withdrawn in 1986/87. However, three of the four were later preserved.

=97409-413=
These five locomotives were renumbered from Class 45 'Peak' locomotives. They were used on infrastructure trains in association with major engineering works. All five locomotives were withdrawn by 1988, and have all since been scrapped.

=97472, 97480, 97545 and 97561=
These four locomotives were converted from Class 47 locomotives in 1989, and were used to haul test-trains throughout the country. Number 97561 was repainted in maroon livery and named &quot;''Midland Counties Railway''&quot; to commemorate the railway's 150th anniversary.

Three of the four locomotives were later renumbered into the range 47971-973, but continued to be employed hauling test-trains. They were later joined by 47974-976 and 47981. The fourth locomotive, no. 97472, was renumbered back to number 47472, and shortly after was withdrawn from traffic due to fire damage.

=97650-654=
These shunting locomotives were purpose-built by Ruston &amp; Hornsby at Lincoln in 1953 (97650) or 1959 (rest). For more details see the main British Rail Class 97/6|Class 97/6 article.

=97701-710=
These locomotives were converted from the driving motor cars from former Class 501 electric multiple units. They were powered by large batteries, and were based at Birkenhead North TMD and were employed around Birkenhead on the Merseyrail system (97701-702) or around North London (rest).

=97800-807=
This number range was reserved for shunting locomotives converted from capital stock. Individual locomotives are described below.
* 97800 - This locomotive was converted from a Class 08 locomotive in 1979 for use as a shunter at Slade Green depot. It was name ''Ivor'', and was later painted in Network South East livery. In 1990, this locomotive was returned to capital stock with its original number.
* 97801 - This locomotive was converted from a Class 08 locomotive in 1978 for use by the Research Department at Derby. It was originally numbered RDB 968020, but was given a Class 97 number in 1979. It was named 'Pluto', and withdrawn in 1981.
* 97802 -This locomotive was converted from a Class 08 locomotive in 1979 for use at Polmadie depot. It was used for only a year in this role before withdrawal.
* 97803 - This locomotive was converted from British Rail's last remaining Class 05 locomotive, no. 05001. It was used on the Isle of Wight railway system, based at Ryde, and was rebuilt with a lower cab to allow it to be used through the restricted-height Ryde Tunnel. It was withdrawn as non-standard, and was replaced by no. 97805.
* 97804 - This locomotive was used at Reading West Signal Works following the withdrawal of 97020, and was converted from a Class 06 locomotive, no. 06003. It was made redundant when the works closed in 1984, and was later preserved. It is now the sole-surviving Class 06 locomotive.
* 97805 - This locomotive was converted from a Class 03 locomotive to replace the non-standard 97803. It was later renumbered back to its original number of 03079, and remained in use on the Isle of Wight until 1996.
* 97806 - This locomotive was a former Class 09 locomotive, which was allocated to Sudbrook for exclusive use on the Severn Tunnel emergency train. The train has been replaced by former Class 121 diesel units, and 97806 returned to capital stock with its original number, 09017.
* 97807 - This locomotive was converted from a Class 03 to assist 97805 on the Isle of Wight. It was later renumbered back to its original number of 03179, and remained in use on the Isle of Wight until 1996.
