Minneapolis () is the largest city in the U.S. state of Minnesota and is the county seat of Hennepin County. The city lies on both banks of the Mississippi River, just north of the river's confluence with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Saint Paul, the state's capital. Known as the ''Twin Cities'', these two cities form the core of Minneapolis-St. Paul, the fifteenth largest metropolitan area in the United States, with about 3.5 million residents. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the population of the city of Minneapolis at 372,811 people in 2005.;; The Metropolitan Council estimate for 2006 was 387,970.;

Abundantly rich in water, the city has twenty lakes and wetlands, the Mississippi riverfront, creeks and waterfalls, many connected by parkways in the Chain of Lakes and the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway. Once the world's flour milling capital and a hub for timber, Minneapolis is the primary business center between Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington.; Regional theater was pioneered at the Guthrie Theater, one of many cultural organizations that draw creative people and audiences to Minneapolis for theater, visual art, writing and music. Indeed, the city was ranked the most literate in the U.S. in 2007.;; A diverse population, the community has a long tradition of charitable support through progressive public social programs and through private and corporate philanthropy. Public park systems are modeled after Minneapolis where a park is within one-half mile (800&amp;nbsp;m) of every home.

The name ''Minneapolis'' is attributed to the city's first schoolmaster, who combined ''mni'', the Dakota word for water, and ''polis'', the Greek word for city.; and ; Minneapolis is nicknamed the City of Lakes and the Mill City.;;

History

Taoyateduta was among the 121 Sioux leaders who from 1837 to 1851 ceded what is now Minneapolis.;. andandand ;

Dakota Sioux were the region's sole residents until explorers arrived from France in about 1680. Nearby Fort Snelling, built between 1820 and 1825 by the United States Army spurred growth in the area. Circumstances pressed the Mdewakanton band of the Dakota to sell their land, allowing people arriving from the east to settle there. The Minnesota Territorial Legislature authorized present day Minneapolis as a town on the Mississippi's west bank in 1856. Minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867, the year rail service began between Minneapolis and Chicago, and joined with the east bank city of St. Anthony in 1872.; and , andand .;

Minneapolis grew up around Saint Anthony Falls, the only waterfall on the Mississippi. Millers have used hydropower since the 1st century B.C.,;; but the results in Minneapolis between 1880 and 1930 were so remarkable the city has been described as &quot;the greatest direct-drive waterpower center the world has ever seen.&quot;;; In early years, forests in northern Minnesota were the source of a lumber industry that operated seventeen saw mills on power from the waterfall. By 1871, the west river bank had twenty-three businesses including flour mills, woolen mills, iron works, a railroad machine shop, and mills for cotton, paper, sashes, and planing wood.;; The farmers of the Great Plains grew grain that was shipped by rail to the city's thirty-four flour mills where Pillsbury and General Mills became processors. By 1905 Minneapolis delivered almost 10% of the country's flour and grist.;; At peak production, a Washburn &quot;A&quot; Mill|single mill at Washburn-Crosby made enough flour for twelve million loaves of bread each day.;;

Minneapolis made dramatic changes to rectify discrimination as early as 1886 when Martha Ripley founded Maternity Hospital for both married and unmarried mothers.;; When the country's fortunes turned during the Great Depression, the violent Teamsters Strike of 1934 resulted in laws acknowledging worker's rights.;; A lifelong civil rights activist and union supporter, mayor Hubert H. Humphrey helped the city establish fair employment practices and a human relations council that interceded on behalf of minorities by 1946.;; Minneapolis contended with white supremacy, participated in desegregation and the African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|African-American civil rights movement, and in 1968 was the birthplace of the American Indian Movement.; and ;

During the 1950s and 1960s as part of urban renewal, the city razed about two hundred buildings across twenty-five city blocks—roughly 40% of downtown, destroying the Gateway District and many buildings with notable architecture including the Metropolitan Building. Efforts to save the building failed but are credited with jumpstarting interest in historic preservation in the state.;;



Geography and climate

Glacial meltwaters formed Saint Anthony Falls near Fort Snelling about ten thousand years ago. Rushing water undercut sandstone and collapsed limestone, moving the falls eight&amp;nbsp;miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) to the northwest.;;
Minneapolis history and the city's economic growth are tied to water, the city's defining physical characteristic, which was sent to the region during the last ice age. Fed by receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz ten thousand years ago, torrents of water from a glacial river undercut the Mississippi and Minnehaha riverbeds, creating waterfalls important to modern Minneapolis.; and ; Lying on an artesian aquifer; and otherwise flat terrain, Minneapolis has a total area of 58.4&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi (151.3&amp;nbsp;km²) and of this 6% is water.; and ; Water is managed by watershed districts that correspond to the Mississippi and the city's three creeks.;; Twelve lakes, three large ponds and five unnamed wetlands are within Minneapolis.;;

Lake Harriet frozen in winter. Ice blocks deposited in valleys by retreating glaciers created the lakes of Minneapolis.;;
The city center is located just south of 45°&amp;nbsp;N latitude.;; The city's lowest elevation of 686&amp;nbsp;ft (209&amp;nbsp;m) is near where Minnehaha Creek meets the Mississippi River. The site of the Prospect Park Water Tower is often cited as the city's highest point; andand ; and a placard in Deming Heights Park denotes the highest elevation, but a spot at 974&amp;nbsp;ft (296.8&amp;nbsp;m) in or near Waite Park in Northeast Minneapolis is corroborated by Google Earth as the highest ground.

Minneapolis has a continental climate typical of the Upper Midwestern United States. Winters can be cold and dry, while summer is comfortably warm although at times it can be hot and humid. On the Köppen climate classification, Minneapolis falls in the warm summer humid continental climate zone (''Dfa''). The city experiences a full range of precipitation and related weather events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and fog. The warmest temperature ever recorded in Minneapolis was 108&amp;nbsp;°F (42.2&amp;nbsp;°C) in July 1936, and the coldest temperature ever recorded was -41&amp;nbsp;°F (-40.6&amp;nbsp;°C), in January 1888. The snowiest winter of record was 1983&amp;ndash;84, when 98.4&amp;nbsp;in (2.5&amp;nbsp;m) of snow fell.;;

Because of its northerly location in the United States and lack of large bodies of water to moderate the air, Minneapolis is sometimes subjected to cold Arctic air masses, especially during late December, January &amp; February. The average annual temperature of 45.4&amp;nbsp;°F (7&amp;nbsp;°C) gives the Minneapolis&amp;ndash;St.Paul metropolitan area the coldest annual mean temperature of any major metropolitan area in the continental U.S.;45.4&amp;nbsp;°F for 1971 through 2000 per [http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0378.xls U.S. Census] who citesor 44.6&amp;nbsp;°F per ;

Demographics

American Swedish Institute. Immigrants from Scandinavia arrived beginning in the 1860s.
During the 1850s and 1860s, new settlers arrived in Minneapolis from New England and New York, and during the mid-1860s, Scandinavians from Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Denmark began to call the city home. Later, immigrants came from Germany, Italy, Greece, Poland, and southern and eastern Europe. Jews from Russia and eastern Europe settled primarily on the north side of the city before moving in large numbers to the western suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s.;; Asians came from China, the Philippines, Japan, and Korea. Two groups came for a short while during U.S. government relocations, Japanese during the 1940s, and Native Americans during the 1950s. From 1970 onward, Asians arrived from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. Beginning in the 1990s, a large Latino population arrived, along with refugees from Africa, especially from Somalia.;;

Into the 21st century, Minneapolis continues its heritage of welcoming newcomers. The metropolitan area is an immigrant gateway with a 127% increase in foreign-born residents between 1990 and 2000.;;

Immigrants rights march in 2006
U.S. Census Bureau estimates in 2005 show the population of Minneapolis to be 372,811, a 2.6% drop since the 2000 census.; The Metropolitan Council estimates the population at 387,711 in 2005,;; and 387,970 in 2006.; The population grew until 1950 when the census peaked at 521,718, and then declined as people moved to the suburbs until about 1990. The number of African-Americans, Asians, and Hispanics is growing. Non-whites are now about one fifth of the city's residents.;;

Compared to the U.S. national average in 2005, the city has fewer white, Hispanic, senior, and unemployed people, while it has more people aged over 18 and more with a college degree.;;

Compared to a peer group in 2000, the metropolitan area is decentralizing, with a high churn rate and a large young and white population and low unemployment. Racial and ethnic minorities lag behind white counterparts in education, with 15% of black and 13% of Hispanic people holding bachelor's degrees compared to 42% of the white population. The standard of living is on the rise, with incomes among the highest in the Midwest, but median household income among black people is below that of white by over $17,000. Home ownership among black and Hispanic residents is half that of white, and one-third of the Asian population lives below the poverty line.;

Parks and recreation
In the Heart of the Beast May Day Parade, Powderhorn Park
The Minneapolis park system has been called the best-designed, best-financed and best-maintained in America.;; Foresight, donations and effort by community leaders enabled Horace Cleveland to create his finest landscape architecture, preserving geographical landmarks and linking them with boulevards and parkways.; and ; The city's Chain of Lakes is connected by bike, running, and walking paths and used for swimming, fishing, picnics, boating, and ice skating.

Government

Spring art party, North Commons Park, Willard-Hay, Minneapolis|Willard-Hay, one of the eighty one neighborhoods of Minneapolis
Minneapolis is a stronghold for the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL), an affiliate of the Democratic Party. The Minneapolis City Council holds the most power and represents the city's thirteen districts called ward (politics)#United States|wards. The council has twelve DFL members and one from the Green Party. R.T. Rybak also of the DFL is the current mayor of Minneapolis. The office of mayor is relatively weak but has some power to appoint individuals such as the chief of police.

In some cases two or more neighborhoods act together under one organization. Some areas are commonly known by nicknames of business associations.; and ;

Minneapolis City Hall
The organizers of Earth Day scored Minneapolis ninth best overall and second among mid-sized cities in their 2007 ''Urban Environment Report'', a study based on indicators of environmental health and their effect on people.;;

Early Minneapolis experienced a period of corruption in local government and crime was common until an economic downturn in the mid 1900s.
