Intraosseous infusion is the process of injection directly into the marrow of the bone.The needle is injected through the bone's hard cortex and into the soft marrow interior.

This route of fluid and medication administration is an alternate one to the preferred IV route when the latter can't be established in a timely manner especially during pediatric emergencies. When IV access cannot be obtained in pediatric emergencies, intraosseous access is usually the next approach. It can be maintained for 24-48 hours, after which another route of access should be obtained. Intraosseous access is used less frequently in adult cases due to greater difficulty penetrating denser adult bone. ;;

Clinical practice guidelines
In 2005, the American Heart Association first included intraosseous infusion as an option for delivery of resuscitation drugs, &quot;If IV access cannot be established, intraosseous (IO) delivery ofresuscitation drugs will achieve adequate plasma concentrations&quot;.;;

Effectiveness
This American Heart Association guideline cited two randomized controlled trials, one of 60 children;; and one of electively cannulated hematology/oncology patients.;; In addition, uncontrolled studies have been performed;;;;, one of which reported 72% to 87% rates of successful insertion.;
