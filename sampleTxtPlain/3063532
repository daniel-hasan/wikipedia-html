The International Wrestling Grand Prix (IWGP) World Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling tag team title in Japanese promotion New Japan Pro Wrestling. It was created in 1985 when Tatsumi Fujinami and Kengo Kimura defeated Antonio Inoki and Seiji Sakaguchi in a tournament final.;; Though in the past it has been held by both heavyweights and junior heavyweights, the creation of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship in 1998 has made it more of an exclusively heavyweight title. In addition to Japan, it has also been defended in the United States and Mexico.;;;; There have been a total of 44 recognized individual champions and 37 recognized teams, who have had a combined 50 official reigns.
