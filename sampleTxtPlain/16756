Korean (, see #Names|below) is the official language of both North Korea and South Korea. It is also one of the two official languages in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China. There are about 80 million Korean speakers, with large groups in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, the United States,Post-Soviet states, and more recently the Philippines. 

The genealogical #Classification|classification of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the Altaic language family, while others consider it to be a language isolate. It is agglutinative in its morphology and SOV in its syntax. Like the Japanese and Vietnamese languages, Korean language was influenced by the Chinese language in the form of Sino-Korean words.Native Korean words account for about 35% of the Korean vocabulary, while about 60% of the Korean vocabulary consists of Sino-Korean words.The remaining 5% comes from loan words from other languages, 90% of which are from English.;Sohn, Ho-Min.

Names
The Korean names for the language are based on the names for Korea used in North and South Korea.

In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called ''Chosŏnmal'' (; with Hanja: ), or more formally, ''Chosŏnŏ'' (;).

In the Republic of Korea, the language is most often called ''Hangungmal''
;
;
;
;
;
(; ), or more formally, ''Hangugeo'' (; ) or ''Gugeo'' (; ; literally &quot;national language&quot;).It is sometimes colloquially called ''urimal'' (&quot;our language&quot;;in one word in South Korea,with a space in North Korea).

On the other hand, Korean people in the Post-Soviet states|former USSR, who refer to themselves as Koryo-saram (also ''Goryeoin'' [; ; literally, &quot;Names of Korea#Historic Names|Goryeo person(s)&quot;]) call the language ''Koryo-mar|Goryeomal'' (; ).

Classification
The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a language isolate.

Since the publication of the article of Ramstedt in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an Altaic language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including number, gender, articles, fusional morphology, voice, and relative pronouns (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some morphological resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely Sakha (Yakut). Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other Turkic languages or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages.;;

It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to Japanese, since the two languages have a similar grammatical structure.Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the Buyeo languages of Goguryeo and Baekje (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje ''mir'', Japanese ''mi-'' &quot;three&quot;.;;

Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a ''sprachbund'' effect.See East Asian languages#Morphology|East Asian languages for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian ''sprachbund'', and Japanese language classification for further details on the possible relationship.

Of the ancient languages attested in the Korean Peninsula, modern Korean is believed to be a descendent of the languages of Samhan and Silla; it is unknown whether these are related to the Buyeo languages, though many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the Goryeo period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the Seven-Year War brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The Jeju dialect preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose ''arae a'' is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.

There are also fringe theories proposing various other relationships; for example, a few linguists such as Homer B. Hulbert have also tried to relate Korean to the Dravidian languages through the similar syntax in both.;;

Dialects

Dialects of Korean
Korean has several dialects (called ''mal'' [literally &quot;speech&quot;], ''saturi'', or ''bang-eon'' in Korean). The standard language (''pyojuneo'' or ''pyojunmal'') of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around Seoul, and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around P'yŏngyang. These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of Jeju Island (see Jeju Dialect). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of Seoul dialect use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the Gyeongsang dialect have a very pronounced intonation.

It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive dialect levelling, or even convergent evolution or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean&quot;mouth&quot; or Gyeongsang dialectvs. Standard Korean&quot;garlic chives.&quot; This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present.See also the Buyeo languages hypothesis.

There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the regions of Korea, since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:

The IPA symbol ; (a subscript double straight quotation mark) is used to denote the tensed consonants . Its official use in the Extended IPA is for 'strong' articulation, but is used in the literature for faucalized voice. The Korean consonants also have elements of stiff voice, but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted glottis and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.

* &quot;female&quot; - north: ''nyŏja'' (녀자), south: ''yeoja'' (여자)

Grammar
= Sentence structure=
Korean is an agglutinative language. Modifiers precede the modified word.The basic form of a Korean sentence is Subject Object Verb, but the verb is the only required and immovable element. 

:A: &quot;가게에 가세요?&quot; ''(gage-e gaseyo?)''
:B: &quot;네.&quot; ''(ne.)''

''Literal translation'':
:A: *&quot;store (가게) + to(에) + go(가) +[polite interrogative marker]?&quot;
:B: &quot;Yes.&quot;

''English equivalent'':
:A: &quot;Going to the store?&quot;
:B: &quot;Yes.&quot;

= Parts of speech=
Verb
Korean verbs (, ''dongsa'', ) are also known in English as &quot;action verbs&quot; or &quot;dynamic verbs&quot; to distinguish them from (, ''hyeong-yongsa'', &quot;adjectives&quot;), which are also known as &quot;descriptive verbs&quot; or &quot;stative verbs&quot;.

Examples include(''hada'', &quot;to do, to have&quot;) and(''gada'', &quot;to go&quot;).For a larger list of Korean verbs, see wikt:Category:Korean verbs.

Unlike most European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners.
The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the T-V distinction of most Indo-European languages.For example, different endings are used based on whether the subjects and listeners are friends, parents, or honoured persons.

Adjective
Words categorized as Korean adjectives (, ''hyeong-yongsa'', ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them &quot;descriptive verbs&quot; or &quot;stative verbs&quot;, but they are distinctly separate from(''dongsa'').

English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs.For example,(''bukda'') translates literally as &quot;to be red&quot; and(''aswipda'') often best translates as &quot;to lack&quot; or &quot;to want for&quot;, but both are(''hyeong-yongsa'', &quot;adjectives&quot;).For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see wikt:Category:Korean adjectives.

Determiner
Korean determiners (, ''gwanhyeongsa'', 冠形詞) are also known in English as &quot;determinatives&quot;, &quot;adnominals&quot;, &quot;pre-nouns&quot;, &quot;attributives&quot;, and &quot;unconjugated adjectives&quot;.Examples include(''gak'', &quot;each&quot;) and(''neurin'',&quot;slow&quot;).For a larger list, see wikt:Category:Korean determiners.

Noun
Korean nouns (, ''myeongsa'', 名詞) are also known in English as &quot;substantives&quot;.Examples include(''gajok'', &quot;household&quot;) and(''mat'', &quot;flavor&quot;).For a larger list, see wikt:Category:Korean nouns.

Pronoun
Korean pronouns (, ''daemyeongsa'', 代名詞) include(''na'', &quot;I&quot;) and(''geu'').For a larger list, see wikt:Category:Korean pronouns.

Adverb
Korean adverbs (, ''busa'', 副詞) include(''tto'', &quot;also&quot;) and(''gadeuk'', &quot;fully&quot;).For a larger list, see wikt:Category:Korean adverbs.

Particle
Korean particles (, ''josa'', 助詞) are also known in English as &quot;postpositions&quot;.Examples include(''neun'', topic marker) and(''reul'', object marker).For a larger list, see wikt:Category:Korean particles.

Interjection
Korean interjections (, ''gamtansa'', 歎詞 ) are also known in English as &quot;exclamations&quot;.Examples include(''ani'', &quot;no&quot;).For a larger list, see wikt:Category:Korean interjections.

Number
Korean numbers (, ''susa'', 數詞) are also known in English as &quot;numerals&quot;.

Speech levels and honorifics


The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in honorifics, while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in speech level.

=Honorifics=

When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like.

=Speech levels=

There are no fewer than 7 verb paradigms or speech levels in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike &quot;honorifics&quot; &amp;mdash; which are used to show respect towards the referent of a subject &amp;mdash; speech levels are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific imperative form of the verb 하다 (''hada'', &quot;do&quot;) in each level, plus the suffix 체 ('che', Hanja: ;體;), which means &quot;style.&quot;

The highest 5 levels are generally grouped together as ''jondaemal'' (존대말), while the lowest 2 levels (''haeche'', 해체) are called ''banmal'' (반말) in Korean.

Vocabulary
The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. More than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 70% by some estimates), however, especially scholarly terminology, are Sino-Korean words, either
* directly borrowed from Written Chinese, or
* coined in Japan or Korea using Chinese characters.

Korean has two number systems: one native, and one borrowed from the Chinese.

To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from Mongolian, Sanskrit, and other languages. 
Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the Tsushima dialect of Japanese.

In modern times, many words have been borrowed from Japanese and Western languages such as German (''wikt:アルバイト|areubaiteu'' ‘part-time job’, ''allereugi'' ‘allergy’) and more recently English. Concerning daily usage vocabulary except what can be written in hanja, more words have possibly been borrowed from English than from any other language. Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example ‘dozen’&amp;nbsp;>;''dāsu''&amp;nbsp;>;''daseu''. Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as ‘German(y)’ (see Names for Germany#Japanese and Korean|Names for Germany), the first part of whose endonymthe Japanese approximated using the kanji; ''doitsu'' that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation: &amp;nbsp;''dok'' + &amp;nbsp;''il'' = ''wikt:독일|Dogil''. In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.

North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.

Writing system



In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using Chinese characters, using hyangchal or idu. Knowledge of such systems were lost, and the Korean language was not written at all; the aristocracy used Classical Chinese for its writing.

Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet, optionally mixing in Hanja to write Sino-Korean words. South Korea still teaches 1800 Hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Modern Korean is written with spaces between words, a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean punctuation marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.

Differences between North Korea and South Korea

The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary.;Kanno, Hiroomi (ed.) / Society for Korean Linguistics in Japan (1987). ''Chōsengo o manabō'' (『朝鮮語を学ぼう』), Sanshūsha, Tokyo. ISBN 4-384-01506-2;

=Pronunciation=
In North Korea, palatalization ofis optional, andcan be pronounced asin between vowels.

Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below.The pronunciations below are given in Revised Romanization, McCune-Reischauer and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.
