The Lhasa Apso is a hunting, non-sporting dog breed originating from Tibet. It was bred originally to guard monasteries. The Lhasa Apso was expected to follow the intruder barking until his master arrived to check on the intruder.

Appearance
According to the American Kennel Club, Lhasa Apsos should measure about 10 to 11 inches at the withers. Males should weigh between 14 and 18 pounds, and females should weigh between 12 and 14 pounds. The forelegs should be straight, and the hindquarters should be well-developed and muscular. The breed standard requires dark brown eyes of medium size and a coal-black nose. Lhasa Apsos are similar in appearance to the Shih tzu dog but their personalities and temperament are very different. Shih Tzus were bred as companion dogs while the Lhasa was bred as a watchdog.

The dog has a coat that is double layered, which to show standards should drape over the entire body and the eyes. A Lhasa's coat should be of good length.All colors are equally acceptable, with or without dark tips to ears and beard. The tail should be carried in a tight screw over the back. The AKC breed standard was approved July 11, 1978.;[http://www.akc.org/breeds/lhasa_apso/index.cfmAmerican Kennel Club - Lhasa Apso];
