Dr Bruce Flegg (born 10 March 1954 in Sydney, New South Wales) is the Member for Moggill having been elected in 2004 and re-elected in 2006.

Shortly before the 2006 Queensland State Election Bruce Flegg replaced Bob Quinn as the leader of the Liberal Party in the Queensland State parliament. This coup came as a surprise to many, particularily Quinn, whose wife Madonna referred to Flegg and his supporters as &quot;a pack of dastards&quot;.;;

Bruce Flegg's performance as leader during the 2006 election was criticised by members of his own party, his coalition party and the media.;;Some members of his own party described his performance as a &quot;miserable failure&quot;.;; Flegg blamed &quot;faceless and nameless&quot; members of the Nationals for leaks critical of him.
;;

Flegg's relationship with the leader of the National Party, Jeff Seeney, had been reported as being very poor, particularly so after Flegg fell asleep during Seeney's speech to the Queensland Nationals' State Conference.;;

On 31 January 2007 Bruce Flegg and Jeff Seeney announced that should the coalition win the next State election the Premier will be Jeff Seeney even if the Liberal Party won more seats than the National Party.;;Members of Flegg's party were critical of this decision.;; 

On 4 December 2007, Bruce Flegg stood aside as leader of the Queensland Liberals following sustained pressure from some of his Parliamentary colleagues. ;; 

Mr Flegg has faced criticism for receiving a disability pension.;; 

He served in the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps (RAAMC). Prior to election he was a General Practitioner.

He has four sons.
