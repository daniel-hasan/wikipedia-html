Technopark Kerala is a technology park in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), India dedicated to electronics, software, and other Information Technology (IT) ventures. It is the first and largest technology park in India.;
;
Launched in 1990, Technopark currently has 3.2 million square feet (310,000&amp;nbsp;square meters) of built-up space. Technopark is home to over 125 companies, which employ more than 17,000&amp;nbsp;professionals. They include one CMMI level 5 and PCMM level 5 company, four CMM Level 5, two CMM Level 3 and several ISO 9001 certified companies. Technopark is promoted by the Government of Kerala, with a mandate to promote entrepreneurship and employment in the region. The policy of economic liberalisation initiated by the government of India in 1991 and the rapid growth of the global software industry during the 1990s has substantially contributed to the growth of Technopark. Over 70% of Kerala's IT exports are from Technopark.;;;;

The units in Technopark include domestic firms, joint ventures and subsidiaries of foreign companies engaged in a wide variety of activities, which include embedded software development, smart card technology, enterprise resource planning (ERP), process control software design, engineering and computer-aided design software development, IT Enabled Services (ITES), process re-engineering, animation and e-business.

Technopark is owned and administered by the Government of Kerala and is headed by a Chief Executive Officer (CEO). In addition to this, it has a Governing Council and a Program Implementation Board, both of which include top officials of the Government.;; The administration of the campus is carried out from the Park Centre that houses the administrative offices including that of the CEO. Technopark also hosts a Technology Business Incubation Cell and Software Competency Centre, situated in the Park Centre. The entire campus is Wi-Fi enabled.

History and mission

In July 1990, the Government of Kerala conceptualized Technopark as a facility to foster the development of high-technology industries in the state. Technopark was set up under the auspices of Electronics Technology Park, Kerala &amp;mdash; an autonomous body under the Department of Information Technology of the government of Kerala.

Technopark's aim was to create infrastructure and provide support required for the development ofhigh-technology companies. Its stated mission is to ''&quot;Provide, Viably, Superior Environment and Services with Assured Quality of Service to Make Technology Businesses Intrinsically Competitive And Successful, and Promote Regional Development through Synergistic Linkages Between Industry, Government and Academia, based on Continuous Improvement and Innovation&quot;'';;

The foundation stone for the first building in Technopark was laid on March 31 1991 by then Kerala Chief Minister, E.K. Nayanar. Noted industrialist K.P.P. Nambiar was Technopark's first Chairman. Technopark was formally dedicated to the nation by then Prime Minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao in 1992.;;

Since then, Technopark has been growing steadily both in size and employee strength. Park Centre, Pamba and Periyar were the only buildings in the beginning. Since then, Technopark has periodically added new buildings such as Nila, Gayathri and Bhavani. With the inauguration of the 850,000&amp;nbsp;sq ft. (85,000&amp;nbsp;sq m.) Thejaswini on February 22 2007, Technopark became the largest IT Park in India.;;

Infrastructure

Technopark aims to provide all the infrastructure and support facilities needed for IT/ITES and electronics companies to function. In addition to built-up office space, it also provides all utilities as well as the connectivity. This is done either directly or through private partners. In addition, Technopark provides business incubation facilities for start-up firms as well as some social infrastructure for the personnel working in the park.

; Phase IV will also become an SEZ once land acquisition is completed. This provides a range of attractive economic benefits to the companies operating within Technopark

Culture
Tech-A-Break parade in Technopark
Technopark's motto is ''Harmony at Work''.The culture in Technopark is cosmopolitan and diverse. Often acclaimed as one of the greenest IT parks in the world,;

; Technopark's campus is lush green. The presence of balconies and expansive terraces on almost all its buildings ensures that the professionals working inside can enjoy the greenery and the fresh air.

Technopark has companies and people from across India and the world. Other than domestic firms, thereare IT and ITES companies from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy and other countries operating here. This makes for a diverse multi cultural community, working in harmony. To promote this harmony in diversity, Technopark has set up a range of facilities and organises an annual set of events, ranging from technical conferences to trekking expeditions to the annual fiesta, Tech-a-break.

=Technopark Club=
Located inside the Technopark Phase I campus, the Club provides a diverse set of facilities for the professionals to unwind. These include a gym, a swimming pool and courts for badminton and table tennis and beach volley ball.

Tech-A-Break is Technopark's annual cultural extravaganza.;

; Typically held over the course of a week, it kicks off with a Carnival parade and ends with performance by top-notch professional bands, dance groups and musicians.;

;
In between, there is a whole string of cultural competitions where teams and groups from different companies square off against each other. These include dance and musical contests, informal events, quiz and a personality contest&amp;mdash;Mr. and Miss Technopark.;

; While the parade winds across Technopark, most of the events are held at the 2000 seat Amphitheatre near Park Centre.

Socio-economic impact
Technopark has come to be the single largest source of employment in Kerala,;

; with over fifteen thousand people working directly in the facility itself. Thus its impact on the city of Trivandrum has been very significant.

Its cosmopolitan workforce has helped bring diversity to the city's population, along with other national entities like the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Southern Command HQ of the Indian Air Force, Government of India offices and major educational institutions. 

The Government has plans to set up an IT Corridor along the National Highway-47 (NH 47), starting from Technopark towards Kollam.;

; Plans are underway to convert the NH 47 into a four lane, high speed corridor. The need for providing high speed connectivity to the neighbouring city of Kochi has also been emphasised to catalyse the spread of IT, by experts like Kiran Karnik &amp;mdash; president of NASSCOM, India's apex organisation of IT firms.;

;

The influx of high-income IT professionals has also resulted in the arrival of high-end apartment complexes, retail chains, top class hotels, multiplexes and all the other facilities of a modern city. Other facilities like an improved road network and a high speed transportation avenue along the alignment of the IT Corridor are also in process or being planned.;

; A massive ''International Convention Center'' is also coming up nearby, at Akkulam. Being built at a cost of Rs 150&amp;nbsp;Crores ($US&amp;nbsp;32&amp;nbsp;Million) by a joint venture of the Raheja Group and the Government of Kerala, it will further boost the supporting infrastructure of Technopark.;

;
;

;

The increase in air travel brought about by the growing IT industry has also prompted the massive expansion in flight services, especially domestic flights, to and from the nearby Trivandrum International Airport. Connectivity with IT hubs like Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad have significantly improved in recent months. This has benefited the general populace as well.

The combined disposable income of Technopark employees has brought an infusion of wealth into the entire region through secondary service activities like retail, hospitality, transportation, financial services and so on. With a potential hundred and fifty thousand IT professionals working in the four Phases of Technopark by 2012,;

; the impact on the economy of the city and its suburbs, with a population of about 2 million, will be significant.
