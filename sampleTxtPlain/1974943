The Nordic flags. From left to right respectively; the flag of Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. 
Nordic Cross Flag, Nordic Cross, Scandinavian Cross is a pattern of flags usually associated with the flags of the Scandinavian countries of which it originated. All the Nordic countries have adopted such flags. The cross design symbolises Christianity and is depicted extending to the edges of the flag with the vertical part of the cross shifted to the hoist side as opposed to flags where the cross is centred on the flag (known as a Greek cross). The first flag with this design was the Danish Dannebrog; thereafter, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, and some of their subdivisions used this as inspiration for their own flags. The Norwegian flag was the first Nordic cross flag with three colours. Though the flags share this pattern, they have individual histories and symbolism. 

Some of the flags in this list do not have official status. Also, note that flag proportions may vary between the different flags and sometimes do even between different versions of the same flag.

Nordic cross flags of Germany
Nordic flags in Germany were historically used to allude to the nation's Norse heritage and Nordic origins. Nordic flag designs very similar to Denmark's, Sweden's, and Norway's national flags were proposed as Germany's national flags in both 1919 and 1948, after World War I and World War II, respectively. Today, the Nordic cross is a feature in some city and district flags or coats of arms.

Other Nordic cross flags of the Baltic
Many territories around the Baltic Sea have begun using Nordic cross flags. Sometimes this is done to bolster the locality's association with the Scandinavian states (and, as with the proposed flags of Latvia and Lithuania, to assert a Baltic identity over a long-standing affiliation with the Russian sphere of influence.)

Nordic cross flags of the British isles
Many locations in England, Scotland and Ireland were colonized by Norse settlers and viking raiders during the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries. Several locales, particularly in the Scottish islands, have flags based on the Nordic cross as a recognition of this Scandinavian heritage.
