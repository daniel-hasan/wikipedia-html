Abrams and Jeffrey Lieber, and is filmed primarily on location in Oahu, Hawaii.;[http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/about.html ABC's 'Lost', about the show]; The pilot episode was first broadcast on September 22, 2004.;; Since then, three seasons have aired.

Production
=Conception=
The series began development in January 2004, when Lloyd Braun, head of ABC at the time, ordered an initial script from Spelling Television based on his concept of a cross between the movies ''Lord of the Flies'', ''Cast Away'' and the popular reality show ''Survivor''.Jeffrey Lieber was hired and wrote ''Nowhere'', based on his pitch to write the pilot.;; Unhappy with the result and a subsequent re-write, Braun contacted J. J. Abrams, who had a deal with Touchstone (now ABC Studios), and was also the creator of the TV series ''Alias'', to write a new pilot script.Although initially hesitant, Abrams warmed up to it on the condition that the show have a supernatural angle to it, and collaborated with Damon Lindelof to create the series' style and characters.; ; Together, Abrams and Lindelof also created a series &quot;bible&quot;, and conceived and detailed the major mythological ideas and plot points for the show's run.; ;The development of the show was constrained by tight deadlines, as it had been commissioned late in the 2004 season's development cycle. Despite the short schedule, the creative team remained flexible enough to modify or create characters to fit actors they wished to cast.;Abrams, J. J and Lloyd Braun, ''Lost Season 1 DVD'' (extras), Buena Vista Home Entertainment, 6 September, 2005.;

''Losts two-part pilot episode was the most expensive in the network's history, reportedly costing between US $10 and US $14 million,;; compared to the average cost of an hour-long pilot in 2005 of US $4 million.;; The show, which debuted on September 22, 2004, became one of the biggest critical and commercial successes of the 2004 television season. Along with fellow new series ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Grey's Anatomy'', ''Lost'' helped to reverse the flagging fortunes of ABC.;; Yet, before it had even aired, Lloyd Braun was fired by executives at ABC's parent company,Disney, because he had greenlighted such an expensive and risky project.;

The world premiere of the pilot episode was on July 24, 2004 at Comic-Con International in San Diego.;[http://www.comic-con.org/cci2004/CCI04-ProgSat.shtml Comic-Con 2004: Saturday's Programming];

=Episode format=
Episodes have a distinct structure: following a recap of events relevant to the upcoming narrative, each show begins with a cold open. Often a close up of a character's eye will follow. At a dramatic juncture, the screen cuts to black and the title graphic, slightly out-of-focus, glides towards the viewer accompanied by an ominous, discordant sound. The opening credits generally appear alphabetically by last name over the scenes that immediately follow. While there is a continuous story arc, each episode relates events concurrently with off-island flashbacks and later, flashforwards, centered on a particular character. The majority of episodes end with a suspenseful twist or cliffhanger, revealed just seconds before a smash cut to black and the title graphic. Others, following a plot resolution, will finish with a reflective closing scene that precedes a simple fade to black, and in particularly tragic or heart-felt closing scenes, the booming noise that accompanies the title graphic will be silenced, amplifying the impact of the event.

=Music=


''Lost'' features incidental music performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra and composed by Michael Giacchino, whose score is primarily orchestral, incorporating several recurring themes for events and characters. Giacchino achieved some of the sounds for the score using unusual instruments, such as striking suspended pieces of the plane's fuselage.;[http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/podcasts/101323.html Official Lost Podcast 9 January 2006];

The opening theme played as the fuzzy out-of-focus, off-axis ''Lost'' logo spins into view is taken from the preset &quot;Armenian Sun&quot; on the Spectrasonics Atmosphere software synthesizer.;[http://www.spectrasonics.net/news/2007/atmosphere-the-lost-patch-revealed-on-youtube/ Spectrasonics Atmosphere: The &quot;Lost&quot; Patch Revealed on YouTube];

On March 21, 2006, the record label Varèse Sarabande released the original television soundtrack for ''Losts first season. The soundtrack included select full-length versions of the most popular themes of the season and the main title, which was composed by series creator J.J. Abrams. Varèse Sarabande released a soundtrack featuring music from the second season of ''Lost'' on October 3, 2006.;[http://www.varesesarabande.com/upcoming.asp Upcoming Releases];

Pop culture songs have been used sparingly in the series, given the mainly orchestral score. When such songs are featured, they usually originate from a Diegesis#Film sound and music|diegetic source, meaning that they are usually generated by an action of one of the characters. Examples are the various songs played on Hurley's portable CD player throughout the first season (until its batteries died in the episode &quot;...In Translation&quot;) or the use of the record player in the second season, which included Cass Elliot's &quot;Make Your Own Kind of Music&quot; and Petula Clark's &quot;Downtown&quot; in the second and third season premieres respectively. In two episodes, Charlie is shown on a street corner playing guitar and singing the Oasis song &quot;Wonderwall&quot;. In the third season's finale, Jack is driving down the street listening to Nirvana's &quot;Scentless Apprentice,&quot; right before he arrives to the Hoffs/Drawlar Funeral Parlor. The only pop song that has ever been used without a source is Ann-Margret's &quot;Slowly,&quot; in the episode &quot;I Do&quot;.

In some international broadcasts, alternate music is utilized. For instance, in the Japanese broadcast of ''Lost'', season one's theme song is &quot;Here I Am&quot; by Chemistry and season two's is &quot;Losin'&quot; by Yuna Ito.

=Filming locations=
''Lost'' is filmed in 35 mm, on Panavision cameras, almost entirely on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. The original island scenes for the pilot were filmed at Mokulē'ia, Hawai'i|Mokulēʻia Beach, near the northwest tip of the island. Later beach scenes take place in secluded spots of the famous North Shore. Cave scenes in the first season were filmed on a sound stage built at a Xerox parts warehouse, which had been empty since an employee mass shooting took place there in 1999.;; The sound-stage and production offices have since moved to the Hawaii Film Office-operated Hawaii Film Studio,;; where the sets depicting Season 2's &quot;Swan Station&quot; and Season 3's &quot;Hydra Station&quot; interiors were built.;;
Various urban areas in and around Honolulu are used as stand-ins for locations around the world, including Los Angeles, New York, Iowa, Miami, South Korea, Iraq, Nigeria, England, France and Australia. For example, scenes set in a Sydney airport were filmed at the Hawaii Convention Center, while a World War II-era bunker was used as an Iraqi Republican Guard installation.;; Extensive archives of filming locations are tracked at a repository at [http://www.lostvirtualtour.com/ Lostvirtualtour.com].

=Online distribution=
In addition to traditional terrestrial and satellite broadcasting, ''Lost'' has been at the forefront of new television distribution methods. It was one of the first series issued through Apple's iTunes Store service for playback on an iPod or within the iTunes software. Since October 2005, new episodes, without commercials, have been available for download the day after they air on ABC, to American audiences only (restriction based on credit card billing address).

In April 2006, Disney announced that ''Lost'' would be available for free online in streaming format, with advertising, on ABC's website, as part of a two-month experiment of future distribution strategies. The trial, which ran from May to June 2006, caused a stir among network affiliates who were afraid of being cut out of advertising revenue. The streaming of ''Lost'' episodes direct from ABC's website was only available to viewers in the United States due to international licensing agreements.;;;;

The UK's Channel 4 has also allowed access to the series online.;Channel 4 Lost Episodes Online [http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/L/lost/vod/index.html Channel 4]; Both parts of &quot;Pilot&quot; were available to watch for free, and other episodes cost GB£0.99 each.

Cast and characters


Image:Lost cast (season 3).png|thumb|300px|From left to right: Ben, Kate, James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford|Sawyer, Claire, Charlie, Jack, Locke, Sayid, Sun-Hwa Kwon|Sun, Desmond, Hugo &quot;Hurley&quot; Reyes|Hurley, Jin-Soo Kwon|Jin &amp; Juliet.
Out of the 324 people on board, there were 72 initial survivors (71 humans and 1 dog) spread across the three sections of the plane crash. The opening season featured 14 regular speaking roles, making it the second largest cast in American primetime television behind ''Desperate Housewives''. While a large cast makes ''Lost'' more expensive to produce, the writers benefit from more flexibility in story decisions. According to series executive producer Bryan Burk, &quot;You can have more interactions between characters and create more diverse characters, more back stories, more love triangles.&quot;;;

The initial season had 14 major roles getting star billing.Naveen Andrews portrayed former Iraqi Republican Guard Sayid Jarrah.Emilie de Ravin played the pregnant Australian Claire Littleton.Matthew Fox acted as the troubled surgeon and protagonist Jack Shephard.Jorge Garcia portrayed Hugo &quot;Hurley&quot; Reyes, an unlucky lotto winner.Maggie Grace played Shannon Rutherford, a former dance teacher.Josh Holloway acted as con man James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford.Yunjin Kim played Sun-Hwa Kwon, the daughter of a powerful Korean businessman and mobster, with Daniel Dae Kim as her husband Jin-Soo Kwon.Evangeline Lilly portrayed fugitive Kate Austen.Dominic Monaghan acted as an ex-rock star drug addict Charlie Pace.Terry O'Quinn played the mysterious John Locke.Harold Perrineau portrayed construction worker Michael Dawson, while child actor Malcolm David Kelley acted as his young son, Walt Lloyd.Ian Somerhalder played Boone Carlyle, chief operating officer of his mother's wedding business and step brother of Shannon.

During the first two seasons, some characters were written out to make room for new characters with new stories.;;;; Boone Carlyle was the first major character to be written out in season one. Walt became a guest star after the events of the first season's finale, making rare appearances throughout season two. Shannon's departure eight episodes into season two made way for newcomers Mr. Eko, a Nigerian Catholic priest and former criminal played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ana Lucia Cortez, an airport security guard and former police officer played by Michelle Rodriguez, and Libby, a purported clinical psychologist portrayed by Cynthia Watros. Ana Lucia and Libby were written out of the series toward the end of season two, as were Michael and Walt.

In season three, Henry Ian Cusick received star billing as former Scottish soldier Desmond David Hume, as did Michael Emerson in the role of Ben Linus (formerly known as Henry Gale), a high ranking member of the &quot;Others.&quot; In addition, three new actors joined the regular cast: Elizabeth Mitchell, as Dr. Juliet Burke and Kiele Sanchez and Rodrigo Santoro as couple Nikki Fernandez and Paulo. Eko was written out early in the season; Nikki and Paulo were killed mid-season in their first flashback episode. Charlie Pace was written out in the season finale.

In season four, Harold Perrineau rejoins the main cast to reprise the role of Michael Dawson.;[http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=entertainment&amp;id=5509852 ABC: Turncoat Michael Returns to &quot;Lost&quot; Island], ''ABC7Chicago.com'', July 25, 2007; Along with Perrineau, Malcolm David Kelley will also reprise his role as Walt in unknown extent. Fisher Stevens joins the cast in the recurring role of Minkowski.;; An additional five new actors, Ken Leung, Lance Reddick, Rebecca Mader, Jeremy Davies and Jeff Fahey, have joined the cast.;;

Numerous supporting characters have been given expansive and recurring appearances in the progressive storyline. In the second season, Rose Henderson played by L. Scott Caldwell and tail section survivor Bernard Nadler played by Sam Anderson were featured in a flashback episode after being reunited. Mira Furlan as Danielle Rousseau, the shipwrecked Frenchwoman, appears throughout the series. Some of the &quot;Others,&quot; including M. C. Gainey as Tom, William Mapother as Ethan Rom, Tania Raymonde as Alex Rousseau and Nestor Carbonell as Characters_of_Lost#Richard_Alpert|Richard Alpert have been shown in both flashbacks and the ongoing story. Similarly, Jack's father Christian Shephard (John Terry) has appeared in multiple flashbacks of various characters.

=Casting=
Many of the first season roles were a result of the executive producers' liking of various actors. The main character Jack was originally going to die in the pilot, and was hoped to be played by Michael Keaton, however ABC executives were adamant that Jack live.;;Before it was decided that Jack would live, Kate was to emerge as the leader of the survivors; she was originally conceived to be more like the character of Rose. Dominic Monaghan auditioned for the role of Sawyer, who at the time was supposed to be a suit-wearing city con man. The producers enjoyed Monaghan's performance and changed the character of Charlie, originally a middle-aged former rock star, to fit him. Jorge Garcia also auditioned for Sawyer, and the part of Hurley was written for him. When Josh Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked the edge he brought to the character (he reportedly kicked a chair when he forgot his lines and got angry in the audition) and his southern accent, so they changed Sawyer to fit Holloway's acting. Yunjin Kim auditioned for Kate, but the producers wrote the character of Sun for her and the character of Jin, portrayed by Daniel Dae Kim, to be her husband. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, was also not in the original script. Locke and Michael were written with their actors in mind. Emilie de Ravin who plays Claire was originally supposed to be a recurring role.; In the second season, Michael Emerson was contracted to play Ben (&quot;Henry Gale&quot;) for three episodes. His role was extended to eight episodes because of his acting skills, and eventually for the whole of season three.; ;

=Future seasons and end date=
On May 7, 2007, ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson announced that ''Lost'' will end during the 2009–2010 season with a &quot;highly anticipated and shocking finale.&quot;;[http://www.abcmedianet.com/assets/pr%5Chtml/050707_01.html ABC GIVES VIEWERS 48 MORE ORIGINAL EPISODES OF THE HIT DRAMA &quot;LOST,&quot; CULMINATING IN AN EXCITING SERIES CONCLUSION]; &quot;We felt that this was the only way to give [''Lost''] a proper creative conclusion,&quot; McPherson said. Beginning with the 2007–2008 television season, the final 48 episodes of ''Lost'' will be aired as three seasons with sixteen episodes each. Thus, ''Lost'' will conclude with its sixth season. These seasons were to be aired uninterrupted in the first half of those years, though due to the Writers' strike, this is now highly unlikely to be the case for Season Four.

The announcement by ABC was called &quot;bold and unprecedented&quot; by ''Losts executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. Lindelof and Cuse also stated that they &quot;always envisioned ''Lost'' as a show with a beginning, middle, and end,&quot; and that by announcing when the show would end that viewers would &quot;have the security of knowing that the story will play out as we've intended.&quot; Co-creator J.J. Abrams also praised the decision, remarking, &quot;It is the right choice for the series and its viewers. It takes real foresight and guts to make a call like this. I applaud ABC and Touchstone for making this happen.&quot;;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117964371.html &quot;Lost&quot; set for three more years], ''Variety.com'', May 6, 2007;

In the meantime, Sci Fi Channel and G4 have purchased the rights to broadcast reruns of ''Lost'' beginning Fall 2008.;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20071016/tv_nm/lost_dc_2 &quot;Lost&quot; Reruns Land at Sci-Fi, G4], ''Yahoo!'', October 15, 2007;

Mythology

;

In parallel to its character development, episodes of ''Lost'' include a number of mysterious elements that have been ascribed to science fiction or supernatural phenomena. The creators of the series refer to these elements as composing the mythology of the series, and they form the basis of fan speculation.;Benson, Jim. [http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA601539.html The 'Lost' Generation: Networks Go Eerie], ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'', May 16, 2005.;

Among the show's mythological elements is a &quot;monster&quot; that appears to roam the island; a mysterious group of inhabitants whom the survivors refer to as &quot;The Others&quot;; an organization called the &quot;DHARMA Initiative&quot; that has placed several research stations on the island; a sequence of numbers that have made frequent appearances in the lives of the characters, in both the past and present; and personal connections between the characters, of which they are often unaware.

=Discredited theories=
;

At the heart of the series is a complex and cryptic storyline that spawns numerous unresolved questions.;
; Encouraged by ''Lost's'' writers and stars, who often interact with fans online, viewers and TV critics alike have taken to widespread theorizing in an attempt to unravel the mysteries. Theories mainly concern the nature of the island, the origins of the &quot;monster&quot; and the &quot;Others,&quot; the meaning of the numbers, and the reasons for both the crash and the survival of some passengers.

Several of the more common fan theories have been discussed and rejected by the show's creators, the most common being that the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 are dead or in purgatory. This was specifically denied by J.J. Abrams because he himself does not know how the series will end.;
; Furthermore, Lindelof has rejected speculation that spaceships or aliens influence the events on the island, or that everything seen is a fictional reality taking place in someone's mind.;;

Carlton Cuse dismissed the theory that the island is a reality TV show and the castaways unwitting housemates;; and Lindelof, many times, refuted the theory that the &quot;monster&quot; is a nanobot cloud similar to the one featured in Michael Crichton's novel ''Prey''.;;;;

Recurring elements
John Locke holds up the two opposing colors of backgammon stones in the pilot episode.

There are several recurring elements and motifs on ''Lost'', which generally have no direct effect on the story itself, but expand the show's literary and philosophical subtext. These elements include frequent appearances of the colors black and white, which reflect the dualism within characters and situations;;; dysfunctional family situations, as portrayed in the lives of nearly all the main characters;;; apocalyptic references, including Desmond's pushing the button to forestall the end of the world and the DHARMA Initiative's goal to alter the parameters of the Valenzetti Equation and prevent the end of humanity;;Lindelof, Damon and Carlton Cuse.

This is seen in character aliases, stories on characters' whereabouts, and con details, such as Ethan Rom's claim that he was from Ontario.;;;;

The pilot episode garnered 18.6 million viewers, easily winning its 9/8 central timeslot, and giving ABC its strongest ratings since 2000 when ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' initially aired — beaten only the following month by the premiere of ''Desperate Housewives''. According to ''Variety'', &quot;ABC sure could use a breakout drama success, as it hasn't had a real hit since ''The Practice''. ''Lost'' represents the network's best start for a drama with eighteen to forty-nine year olds since ''Once and Again'' in 1999, and in total viewers since ''Murder One'' in 1995.&quot;;;

Based on its strong opening, Reuters dubbed it a &quot;hit drama&quot; noting that &quot;the show appeared to have benefited from an all-out marketing blitz that included radio spots, special screenings and ABC's first billboard advertising campaign in five years.&quot;;; After four episodes aired, ABC announced ''Lost'' had been picked up for a full season order.;;

For its first season, ''Lost'' averaged 16 million viewers, ranking 14th in viewership among prime-time shows, and 15th among the eighteen to forty-nine year old demographic.;; Its second season fared equally well: again, ''Lost'' ranked 14th in viewership, with an average of 15.5 million viewers. However, it improved its rating with eighteen to forty-nine year olds, ranking 8th.;; The second season premiere was even more viewed than the first, pulling in over 23 million viewers and setting a series record.;; The third season premiere brought in 18.8 million viewers. The seventh episode of the series, back from a three-month hiatus, saw a drop to 14.5 million. Over the course of the spring season, ratings would plunge to as low as 11 million viewers before recovering to near 14 million for the season finale. The ratings drop was partially explained when Nielsen released DVR ratings, showing ''Lost'' as the most recorded series on television. However, despite overall ratings losses, ''Lost'' still won its hour in the crucial 18–49 demographic and put out the highest 18–49 numbers in the 10pm time slot ahead of any show on any network that season.

A survey of twenty countries by ''Informa Telecoms and Media'' in 2006 concluded that ''Lost'' was the second most popular TV show in the world, next to ''CSI: Miami''.;;

= Fandom and popular culture=
Like other cult television shows, ''Lost'' has generated a dedicated and thriving international fan community. ''Lost'' fans, sometimes dubbed ''Lostaways'';; or ''Losties'',;; have gathered at Comic-Con International and conventions organized by ABC,;;; but have also been active in developing a large number of fan websites, including Lostpedia, and forums dedicated to the program and its related incarnations.;;;;;;;; Because of the show's elaborate mythology, its fansites have focused on speculation and theorizing about the island's mysteries, as well as on more typical fan activities such as producing fan fiction and videos, compiling episode transcripts, shipping characters, and collecting memorabilia.

Anticipating fan interest and trying to keep its audience engrossed, ABC embarked on various cross-media endeavors, often using new media. Fans of ''Lost'' have been able to explore ABC-produced tie-in websites, tie-in novels, an official forum sponsored by the creative team behind ''Lost'' (&quot;The Fuselage&quot;), &quot;mobisodes,&quot; podcasts by the producers, an official magazine, and an alternate reality game (ARG) &quot;The Lost Experience.&quot;;;; An official fanclub was launched in the summer of 2005 through Creation Entertainment.;

Due to the show's popularity, references to the series and elements from its story have appeared in parody and popular culture usage. These include appearances on television, such as on the series ''Veronica Mars'', ''Will &amp; Grace'', ''Bo Selecta'', ''The Sarah Silverman Program'', ''My Wife And Kids'', ''Chuck'', ''Notes from the Underbelly'' and ''The Office''; as well as on the cartoons ''Family Guy'', ''American Dad!'', ''South Park'', and ''Venture Brothers''; and even on a commercial for KFC Hawaii.Also, ''Red vs. Blue'', a ''Machinima'' ''Comic science fiction'' seemed to have poked fun at it in (one of) the ending(s) to the series, episode 100. The makers of Red vs. Blue also poked fun at the Lost intro in an episode of The Strangerhood. Comic books such as ''Catwoman'' and ''The Thing'', daily strips ''Monty'' and ''Over the Hedge'', web comics ''Piled Higher and Deeper'';[http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=766 Piled Higher and Deeper]; and ''Penny Arcade''; [http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/11/01 Penny Arcade]; and humor magazine ''Mad'' have all incorporated ''Lost'' references. Similarly, several rock bands have published songs whose themes and titles were derived from the series, such as Moneen (&quot;Don't Ever Tell Locke What He Can't Do&quot;), Senses Fail (&quot;Lost And Found&quot;), and Gatsbys American Dream (&quot;You All Everybody&quot; and &quot;Station 5: The Pearl&quot;).

In addition, after the episode &quot;Numbers&quot; aired on March 2, 2005, numerous people used the eponymous figures as lottery entries. According to the ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review'', within three days, the numbers were tried over 500 times by local players.;; Likewise, in the same period, over 200 people in Michigan alone used the sequence for the Mega Millions lottery;; and by October, thousands had tried them for the multi-state Powerball lottery.;;;;

=Copyright issues=
The network and the studio producing ''Lost'' were sued by writer Anthony Spinner, who states that in the 1970s he came up with an idea for a television series that had a similar premise to the popular television series. He claimed entitlement of royalties due to fraud and breach of contract. However, since the August 2005 claim, there have not been any updates on the matter.;;

Other media
The characters and setting of ''Lost'' have appeared in several official tie-ins outside of the television broadcast, including in print, on the Internet, and in short videos for mobile phones.

For example, during the first season, a fictional diary by an unseen survivor called &quot;Janelle Granger&quot; was presented on the ABC web site for the series. Likewise, a tie-in website about the fictional Oceanic Airlines appeared during the first season, which included several Easter eggs and clues about the show. Another tie-in website was launched after the airing of &quot;Episodes of Lost (season 2)#Orientation|Orientation&quot; about the Hanso Foundation. In the UK, the interactive back-stories of several characters are included in &quot;Lost Untold,&quot; a section of Channel 4's ''Lost'' website.

The game presents a five-phase parallel storyline, primarily involving the Hanso Foundation.;;
