Biography
Rua was born on November 25 1981 in Curitiba, Brazil. His family also lives in Curitiba. His father is a successful businessman that runs his own business. His mother was a track athlete and is currently a marathon runner. The Rua brothers also run marathons sometimes.;; He has two brothers, his older brother, Murilo (born 1980) and his younger brother, Marco &quot;Shaolin&quot; Rua;. Marco is also a mixed martial artist and Marco is currently training at Chute Boxe, though not at a professional level like his older brothers.

On September 1,2007, Rua married physiotherapist Renata Riberio.;[http://www.onzuka.com/news.html The Chute Boxe athlete had married in the last September first with the physiotherapist Renata Riberio in Maringa , Paraná state,];

=Martial arts background=
Rua began training martial arts with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at the age of six and Muay Thai at seven, at which he became 10-0.;Commentator Mauro Ranallo, at 0:15 of round 1 of Mauricio Rua vs. Hiromitsu Kanehara, PRIDE 29. &quot;Shogun started training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at the age of six, Muay Thai at seven. Was 10 and 0 in Muay Thai.&quot;; He was very successful in BJJ championships at the Blue and Purple belt level. Rua followed his older brothers' footsteps after Murilo started training in Muay Thai with the Chute Boxe Academy. In addition to Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, he also currently trains in wrestling and western boxing.;;;;

=Meca World Vale Tudo= 
Rua started his career at the Meca World Vale Tudo event in Brazil. On his debut, Rua fought Rafael Capoeira, knocking him out with a head kick in the first round. At Meca World Vale Tudo 9, Shogun fought and beat current teammate Evangelista &quot;Cyborg&quot; Santos. The fight was very fast paced and &quot;Cyborg&quot; had Rua in trouble on his feet, forcing him to take the fight to the ground and finish it with punches from the mount, after Santos defended plenty of submission attempts.

=IFC= 
Rua's first loss came at the hands of Renato &quot;Babalu&quot; Sobral during the IFC tournament &quot;Global Domination&quot; on September 6, 2003 by submission (guillotine choke). Though the fight was very even, Rua was caught in a guillotine in the third round. &quot;Babalu&quot; had to fight for nearly two minutes in order to adjust the guillotine and get &quot;Shogun&quot; to tap out. Earlier that night, &quot;Shogun&quot; showed great ground skills escaping submission after submission attempt from Eric Wanderlei. Early in the second round, Rua knocked Wanderlei out with punches to the face.

=PRIDE Fighting Championship=

Mauricio Rua attacking Hiromitsu Kanehara with a flying stomp. Rua has exhibited noted ability with his kicks and stomps against grounded opponents throughout his career in PRIDE FC.;In the above match, commentator Bas Rutten states Rua's skill against grounded opponents owes to Chute Boxe's specific training practice of attacking padded, grounded training partners.; 
Rua exhibited a great ground game in his early fights in PRIDE,;During the English broadcast, MMA legend Royce Gracie stated that Rua has a very good ground game.; but defeated his first five opponents in the first rounds with punches, stomps, and soccer kicks.Rua moved on from his PRIDE Bushido fights to the larger PRIDE 29 with his match against Hiromitsu Kanehara, going in referred to by the commentators as the &quot;heir apparent&quot; to famed teammate Wanderlei Silva.;Mauro Ranallo: &quot;He's a well-versed Muay Thai fighter, well-versed in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and really, a lot of people feel he is indeed the heir apparent to Wanderlei Silva.&quot; Bas Rutten: &quot;Yes, and that's including me.&quot;; He won with soccer kicks and stomps to the face at 1:40 in the first round, with the commentators noting that even famed 225 lb. striker Mirko Filipović|Mirko Cro-cop wasn't able to take out Kanehara in a full fight.;Bas Rutten, PRIDE 29. &quot;I mean, Cro-cop could not take him out ... in a full fight! And now, he just demolishes him.&quot;;

Rua then entered the PRIDE 2005 205 lb. Grand Prix tournament as a heavy underdog. His first opponent would be Quinton &quot;Rampage&quot; Jackson, whom he had challenged after Jackson won a controversial split decision over his brother, Murilo &quot;Ninja&quot; Rua, at the previous PRIDE event, PRIDE 29. Jackson had been the runner-up in the PRIDE 2003 205 lb. Grand Prix, but Mauricio dominated the favored fighter from beginning to end, breaking Jackson's ribs with knee strikes and ending the fight with soccer kicks to the face in the first round. Jackson has stated that Rua is the best fighter he has ever fought.;;

Rua's next fight in the tournament would be against rival academy Brazilian Top Team member Antonio Rogerio Nogueira. In one of the most exciting bouts of 2005, where each contestant scored a knock down on the other, Rua was able to edge out a unanimous decision against Nogueira. On August 28, 2005, &quot;Shogun&quot; cemented his place in MMA history when he won the 2005 Grand Prix tournament by defeatingAlistair Overeem and Ricardo Arona, both by TKO in the first round. 

Rua came back at PRIDE 31 where he suffered his second loss, now at the hands of Heavyweight Mark Coleman. The fight was stopped when Rua dislocated his elbow following a takedown by Coleman in which he landed awkwardly. Rua has repeatedly expressed interest in a rematch with Coleman.

After the elbow injury, Rua returned to the ring on September 10, 2006 to face French striker Cyrille Diabate. Rua defeated Diabate via TKO (stomps).On October 21, 2006, Rua defeated former UFC champion Kevin Randleman with a kneebar two minutes into the first round.After PRIDE 32 Rua said that he wants to fight in the Middleweight GP in 2007, and fight as a Heavyweight in 2008;;, however it is unknown how likely that scenario would be following Zuffa Inc. purchasing PRIDE. On December 31, 2006, at PRIDE Shockwave 2006, Rua defeated Kazuhiro Nakamura by unanimous decision after out-grappling the judoka. His last fight was a knockout victory at PRIDE 33 in a rematch against Dutchman Alistair Overeem.

By the end of his run at PRIDE, Rua was ranked as the top light heavyweight in the world by Nokaut, Sherdog.com, and MMAWeekly.com.;;;;;;

=Ultimate Fighting Championship=
After the sale of PRIDE FC, Rua signed a lucrative deal with the UFC and made his debut for the organization at UFC 76 on September 22, 2007. Notable rule differences between PRIDE FC and the UFC (which uses the Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Combat) include the prohibition of kicking, stomping or kneeing to the head of a downed opponent. 

In his UFC debut, Rua took on ''The Ultimate Fighter 1'' winner Forrest Griffin. Widely regarded as the top light heavyweight in the world at the time of the fight, Shogun was considered a heavy favorite to win.; ; For two rounds, neither fighter clearly established dominance, although most commentators gave Griffin a slight edge. By the third round, a visibly exhausted Rua was unable to keep pace against the aggressive Griffin and repeatedly gave up his back while scrambling on the ground. With only 15 seconds remaining in the fight Griffin locked in a rear naked choke, forcing Rua to tap out.;; It has since been reported that Rua had suffered a torn knee ligament during training for the Griffin fight that required surgery after the loss.;;

It has been stated since then that Rua will be medically cleared to fight and commence with regular training as of February of 2008. Both Mauricio and his brother Murilo have recently announced that they have left Chute Boxe with plans to open up their own facility in Massachusetts.

Rua has announced that he is currently set to return at UFC 83 in April. ;;

Mixed martial arts record
;
As of September 2007, Rua has compiled a professional record of 16 wins and 3 losses, with 13 wins by knockout and one by submission.;;
