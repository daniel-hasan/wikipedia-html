}}Ernesto Guevara de la Serna (June 14, 1928; – October 9, 1967), commonly known as Che Guevara, El Che or just Che was an Argentine-born Marxist revolutionary, political figure, and leader of Cuban and internationalist guerrillas.

As a young man studying medicine, Guevara travelled rough throughout South America, bringing him into direct contact with the impoverished conditions in which many people lived. His experiences and observations during these trips led him to the conclusion that the region's socio-economic inequalities could only be remedied by socialism through revolution, prompting him to intensify his study of Marxism and travel to Guatemala to learn about the reforms being implemented there by President Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán.

While in Mexico in 1956, Guevara joined Fidel Castro's revolutionary 26th of July Movement, which seized power from the regime of the dictator;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9038387/Che-Guevara Che Guevara. (2007)]. In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved July 19, 2007, from ''Britannica Concise Encyclopedia''.; General Fulgencio Batista in Cuba in 1959. In the months after the success of the revolution, Guevara was assigned the role of &quot;supreme prosecutor&quot;, overseeing the public show trials and executions of hundreds of military and civilian leaders associated with the previous regime.;&quot;Many of Batista's military and civilian leaders were given public show trials. Hundreds were executed and the government confiscated their properties.&quot; (Source: ''&quot;The History of Cuba&quot;'' by Clifford L.

For the most part, these were not the top henchmen of the ancien régime; most had escaped before the rebels assumed control of the city and halted outgoing air and sea traffic, or remained holed up in embassies. Most of those left behind were deputies, or rank and file ''chivatos'' and police torturers. The trials began at eight or nine in the evening, and, more often than not, a verdict was reached by two or three in the morning. Duque de Estrada, whose job it was to gather evidence, take testimonies, and prepare the trials, also sat with Che, the &quot;supreme prosecutor,&quot; on the appellate bench, where Che made the final decision on the men's fate.&quot; Source: Anderson, Jon Lee.

Family heritage and early life
Guevara (center) with friends as a young child.Ernesto Guevara de la Serna was born in Rosario, Argentina, the eldest of five children in a family of Spanish and Irish descent; both his father and mother were of Basque ancestry. One of Guevara's forebears, Patrick Lynch, was born in Galway, Ireland, in 1715. He left for Bilbao, Spain, and traveled from there to Argentina. Francisco Lynch (Guevara's great-grandfather) was born in 1817, and Ana Lynch (his grandmother) in 1868. Her son, Ernesto Guevara Lynch (Guevara's father) was born in 1900. Guevara Lynch married Celia de la Serna y Llosa in 1927 (one of her non-lineal ancestors was José de la Serna e Hinojosa, Spanish viceroy of Peru), and they had three sons and two daughters.

Bustillo. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Media: Casa Che Guevara 3.jpg|;Another view.;Growing up in this leftist-leaning ''déclassé'' family of aristocratic lineage, Ernesto Guevara became known for his dynamic personality and radical perspective even as a boy. He idolized Francisco Pizarro and yearned to have been one of his soldiers.;Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 446. &quot;At one time I wanted to be one of Pizarro's soldiers; but [to fulfill] my quest for adventures and my yearnings to overlook climatic moments, that isn't a necessity any longer; today it is all here, and with an ideal to fight for, together with the responsibility of leaving an example.&quot; -- excerpt from a December 1959 letter to his parents.; Though suffering from the crippling bouts of asthma that were to afflict him throughout his life, he excelled as an athlete. He was an avid rugby union player despite his handicap and earned himself the nickname &quot;Fuser&quot; &amp;mdash; a contraction of &quot;El Furibundo&quot; (&quot;The Raging&quot;) and his mother's surname, &quot;Serna&quot; &amp;mdash; for his aggressive style of play. Ernesto was nicknamed &quot;Chancho&quot; (&quot;pig&quot;) by his schoolmates because he rarely bathed, something he was rather proud of.;Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 28.;Guevara on a ''Donkey#Burro|burro'' at the age of 3.

Guevara learned chess from his father and began participating in local tournaments by the age of 12.;Digital Granma Internacional, &quot;Simultaneous chess game on 37th anniversary of Che’s death&quot;, 13 October 2004. [http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2004/octubre/mier13/42CHE.html Online at Granma International English Edition], accessed January 5, 2006.; During his adolescence, he became passionate about poetry, especially that of Pablo Neruda. Guevara, as is common practice among Latin Americans of his class, also wrote poems throughout his life. He was an enthusiastic and eclectic reader, with interests ranging from adventure classics by Jack London, Emilio Salgari, and Jules Verne to essays on sexuality by Sigmund Freud and treatises on social philosophy by Bertrand Russell. In his late teens, he developed a keen interest in photography and spent many hours photographing people, places and, during later travels, archaeological sites.

In 1948Guevara entered the University of Buenos Aires to study medicine. As a student, he spent long periods traveling around Latin America. In 1951 his older friend, Alberto Granado, a biochemist, suggested that Guevara take a year off from his medical studies to embark on a trip they had talked of making for years, traversing South America. Guevara and the 29-year-old Granado soon set off from their hometown of Alta Gracia astride a 1939 Norton 500&amp;nbsp;cc motorcycle they named ''La Poderosa II''&amp;nbsp; (&quot;The Mighty One, the Second&quot;) with the idea of spending a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo Leper colony in Peru on the banks of the Amazon River. Guevara narrated this journey in ''The Motorcycle Diaries'', which was translated into English in 1996 and used in 2004 as the basis for a motion picture of the same name, directed by Walter Salles.

Witnessing the widespread poverty, oppression and disenfranchisement throughout Latin America, and influenced by his readings of Marxist literature, Guevara decided that the only solution for the region’s inequalities was armed revolution. His travels and readings also led him to view Latin America not as a group of separate nations but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide strategy for liberation. His conception of a borderless, united Ibero-America sharing a common 'mestizo' culture was a theme that would prominently recur during his later revolutionary activities. Upon returning to Argentina, he expedited the completion of his medical studies, completed his education as a medic in order to resume his travels in Central and South America and received his diploma on 12 June 1953.

Guatemala
On 7 July 1953, Guevara set out on a trip through Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador. During the final days of December 1953 he arrived in Guatemala wherePresident Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán headed the second fully democratic and modern government in the whole Latin-American region that, through land reform and other initiatives, was attempting to bring an end to the U.S.-dominated ''latifundia'' system. In a contemporaneous letter to his Aunt Beatriz, Guevara explained his motivation for settling down for a time in Guatemala: &quot;In Guatemala&quot;, he wrote, &quot;I will perfect myself and accomplish whatever may be necessary in order to become a true revolutionary.&quot;;Guevara Lynch, Ernesto. ''Aquí va un soldado de América''. Barcelona: Plaza y Janés Editores, S.A., 2000,p. 26. &quot;En Guatemala me perfeccionaré y lograré lo que me falta para ser un revolucionario auténtico.&quot; This statement in a letter written in Costa Rica on 10 December 1953 is important because it proves that, whereas many authors have asserted that Guevara became a revolutionary as a result of witnessing the US-sponsored coup against Arbenz, he had in fact already made the decision to become a revolutionary before arriving in Guatemala and indeed went there for that express purpose.;A map showing Che Guevara's movements between 1953 and 1956; including his trip north to Guatemala, his stay in Mexico and his journey east by boat to Cuba with Fidel Castro and other revolutionaries.

Shortly after reaching Guatemala City, Guevara acted upon the suggestion of a mutual friend that he seek out Hilda Gadea Acosta, a Peruvian economist who was living and working there. Gadea, whom he would later marry, was well-connected politically as a result of her membership in the socialist American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA) led by Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, and she introduced Guevara to a number of high-level officials in the Arbenz government. He also re-established contact with a group of Cuban exiles linked to Fidel Castro whom he had initially met in Costa Rica; among them was Antonio &quot;Ñico&quot; López, associated with the attack on the &quot;Carlos Manuel de Céspedes&quot; barracks in Bayamo in the Cuban province of Oriente,;Radio Cadena Agramonte, &quot;Ataque al cuartel del Bayamo&quot; [http://www.cadenagramonte.cubaweb.cu/historia/cuartel_bayamo.asp Online], accessed February 25 2006.; and who would die at Ojo del Toro bridge soon after the ''Granma'' landed in Cuba.;Granma.cu, &quot;Walking towards sunrise&quot; [http://www.granma.cu/ingles/noviem4/48bermudez-i.html Online], accessed February 25 2006.; Guevara joined these &quot;moncadistas&quot; in the sale of religious objects related to the Christ#Race of Christ|Black Christ of Esquipulas, and he also assisted two Venezuelan malaria specialists at a local hospital. It was during this period that he acquired his famous nickname, &quot;Che&quot;, due to his frequent use of the Argentine interjection ''Che'' (), which is used in much the same way as &quot;hey&quot;, &quot;pal&quot;, &quot;eh&quot;, or &quot;mate&quot; are employed colloquially in various English-speaking countries. Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and southern Brazil (where the interjection is rendered 'tchê' in written Portuguese) are the only areas where this expression is used, making it a trademark of the Río de la Plata|Rioplatense region.

Guevara's attempts to obtain a medical internship were unsuccessful and his economic situation was often precarious, leading him to pawn some of Hilda's jewelry.; Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 139–141; He maintained a distance from any political organization, even though his political thinking at that time manifested a clear sympathy towards communism. Despite Guevara’s financial woes, he rejected an offer to work as a state medic when it transpired that he would have to affiliate himself with the Communist Party of Guatemala.; Political events in the country began to move quickly after May 15, 1954 when a shipment of Škoda Works|Škoda infantry and light artillery weapons sent from Communist Czechoslovakia for the Arbenz Government arrived in Puerto Barrios aboard the Swedish ship ''Alfhem''. The amount of Czechoslovak weaponry was estimated to be 2000 tons by the CIA;U.S. Department of State, &quot;Foreign Relations, Guatemala, 1952–1954&quot;.

''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 144;

Guevara briefly left Guatemala for El Salvador to pick up a new visa, then returned to Guatemala only a few days before the CIA-sponsored coup attempt led by Carlos Castillo Armas began.; The anti-Arbenz forces tried, but failed, to stop the trans-shipment of the Czechoslovak weapons by train. However, after pausing to regroup and recover energy, Castillo Armas' column seized the initiative and, apparently with the assistance of US air support, started to gain ground.;Holland, Max. &quot;Private Sources of U.S. Foreign Policy: William Pawley and the 1954 Coup d'Etat in Guatemala&quot;, ''Journal of Cold War Studies'', Volume 7, Number 4, Fall 2005, pp. 36–73; Guevara was eager to fight on behalf of Arbenz and joined an armed militia organized by the Communist Youth for that purpose; but, frustrated with the group's inaction, he soon returned to medical duties. Following the coup, he again volunteered to fight but his efforts were thwarted when Arbenz took refuge in the Mexican Embassy and told his foreign supporters to leave the country. After Gadea was arrested, Guevara sought protection inside the Argentine consulate where he remained until he received a safe-conduct pass some weeks later. At that point, he turned down a free seat on a flight back to Argentina that was offered to him by the embassy, preferring instead to make his way to Mexico.

The overthrow of the Arbenz regime by a coup d'état backed by the Central Intelligence Agency cemented Guevara's view of the United States as an imperialist power that would implacably oppose and attempt to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries. This strengthened his conviction that socialism achieved through armed struggle and defended by an armed populace was the only way to rectify such conditions.

In June 1955, López introduced him to Raúl Castro. Several weeks later, Fidel Castro arrived in Mexico City after having been amnestied from prison in Cuba, and on the evening of 8 July, 1955, Raúl introduced Guevara to the older Castro brother. During a fervid overnight conversation, Guevara became convinced that Fidel was the inspirational revolutionary leader for whom he had been searching, and he immediately joined the &quot;26th of July Movement&quot; that intended to overthrow the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. Although it was planned that he would be the group's medic, Guevara participated in the military training alongside the other members of the 26J Movement, and at the end of the course, was singled out by their instructor, Col. Alberto Bayo, as his most outstanding student.;Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', ISBN 0-8021-1600-0, New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 194.; Meanwhile, Hilda Gadea had arrived from Guatemala and she and Guevara resumed their relationship. In the summer of 1955, she informed him that she was pregnant, and he immediately suggested that they marry. The wedding took place on August 18, 1955, and their daughter, whom they named Hilda Beatríz, was born on February 15, 1956.;Taibo, Paco Ignacio II.

When the cabin cruiser ''Granma'' set out from Tuxpan, Veracruz for Cuba on November 25, 1956, Guevara was one of only four non-Cubans aboard. Attacked by Batista's military soon after landing, about half of the expeditionaries were killed or executed upon capture. Guevara wrote that it was during this confrontation that he laid down his knapsack containing medical supplies in order to pick up a box of ammunition dropped by a fleeing comrade, a moment which he later recalled as marking his transition from physician to combatant. Only 15–20 rebels survived as a battered fighting force; they re-grouped and fled into the mountains of the Sierra Maestra to wage guerrilla warfare against the Batista regime.Image:Cuba - Santa Clara - stèle du Che.JPG|thumb|right|A Remembrance of attack on Santa Clara.

Guevara became a leader among the rebels, a ''Comandante'' (English translation: Major), respected by his comrades in arms for his courage and military prowess,;U. S.

Harvard University Press, 1999 p. 651: &quot;In the resistance, Guevara soon became commander of a detachment, quickly gaining a reputation for ruthlessness; a child in his guerrilla unit who had stolen a little food was immediately shot without trial.&quot; ; In March 1958, Guevara was tasked with directing a training camp for new volunteers high in the Sierra Maestra at Minas del Frío, one of a number of military schools set up by the 26th of July Movement. Though wishing to push the battlefront forward and frustrated by his more stationary role, Guevara spent the period developing contacts with sympathetic locals.;Anderson p. 317.; He also conducted a brief relationship with eighteen-year-old Zoila Rodríguez, the daughter of a local ''guajiro''.;[http://www.fenix.islagrande.cu/Noticias/Chetestimonio.htm ''Testimonio de Zoila Rodríguez García, novia de Ernesto Guevara en Sierra Maestra''; incluido en el libro ''Che entre nosotros''(1992), de Adys Cupull y Froilán González];

As the war extended throughout eastern Cuba, Guevara and a new column of fighters were dispatched west for the final push towards Havana. In the final days of December 1958, he directed his &quot;suicide squad&quot; (which undertook the most dangerous tasks in the rebel army);Ernesto Che Guevara, &quot;Suicide Squad: Example Of Revolutionary Morale (an excerpt from ''Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War - 1956-58'').

Valdés). ''Revolutionary Struggle. 1947–1958''. Cambridge, Massachusetts and London: MIT Press, 1972, pp. 439–442.;;Castro, Fidel. (December 27, 1983). Speech given in Palma Soriano, Cuba. [http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/castro/1983/19831227 Online]. In this speech, given at the dedication of a publishing house and commemorating the 25th anniversary of the taking of Palma, Castro discussed the importance to the revolution of the taking of Palma on the way to Santiago.He talked about the previous recent fighting at Guisa, Baire, Jiguani, and in the Sierra Maestra and how as a result of revolutionary successes the Cuban army in Bayamo was unable to consolidate forces with its surrounding units. Castro went on to describe the strategic importance of the revolutionary position along the banks of the Cautillo River as a position from which the army at Bayamo could be contained while, on the other side, the army at Santiago could be targeted once Palma was taken and the revolutionary forces re-armed. With respect to the planned attack against Santiago, Castro said: ''We established our defensive line on the Cautillo River. We had Mapos surrounded, but there was still Palma. There were approximately 300 enemy soldiers. We had to take Palma. We were also anxious to take the arms that were to be found in Palma, because when we left La Plata, in the Sierra Maestra, because of the latest offensive, we left with 25 armed soldiers and 1,000 unarmed recruits. We armed those troops along the way. We armed them during the fighting, but we really finished fully arming them in Palma.'' Castro then described the battle in detail and mentioned how, after the overthrow of Batista, the final war orders to the rebels were issued from Palma on January 1, 1959.;;Dorschner, John and Roberto Fabricio.

On February 7, 1959, the government proclaimed Guevara &quot;a Cuban citizen by birth&quot; in recognition of his role in the triumph of the revolutionary forces. Shortly thereafter, he initiated divorce proceedings to put a formal end to his marriage with Gadea, from whom he had been separated since before leaving Mexico on the ''Granma''. On June 2, 1959, he married Aleida March, a Cuban-born member of the 26th of July movement with whom he had been living since late 1958.TIME magazine, August 8, 1960.

He was appointed commander of the La Cabaña Fortress prison, and during his five-month tenure in that post (January 2 through June 12, 1959),;Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 372 and p. 425; he oversaw the trial and execution of many people, among whom were former Batista regime officials and members of the &quot;Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities&quot; (BRAC), a unit of the secret police known by its Spanish acronym. José Vilasuso, an attorney who worked under Guevara at La Cabaña preparing indictments, said that these were lawless proceedings where &quot;the facts were judged without any consideration to general juridical principles&quot; and the findings were pre-determined by Guevara.;&quot;Executions at La Cabaña fortress under Ernesto &quot;Ché&quot; Guevara&quot;.

In this document, Vilasuso (who, along with most of the other legally-trained participants, quit due to its excesses) described the La Cabaña tribunal as the “Purging Commission”.He described a process where “[t]he statements of the investigating officer constituted irrefutable proof of wrongdoing” and where &quot;[t]here were relatives of victims of the previous regime who were put in charge of judging the accused.&quot; He also provided vivid recollections of the final hours of the condemned with their family and friends, and he gave a graphic description of the execution details.He recalled that Guevara &quot;chastised us all: 'Don’t delay these trials. This is a revolution, the proofs are secondary. We have to proceed by conviction. They are a gang of criminals and murderers. Besides, remember that there is an Appeals Tribunals [sic]'.&quot; But the Appeals Tribunal, according to Vilasuso, &quot;never decided in favor of the appeal. It simply confirmed the sentences. It was presided by Commander Ernesto Guevara Serna.&quot;;;&quot;He worked at La Cabana prison, where a great number of people were executed, including some of his former comrades-in-arms who refused to abandon their democratic beliefs.

The revolutionaries resorted to arbitrary procedures in trying their victims, appealing to sentiments of 'ordinary justice' to legitimize their executions. In the first six months of 1959 about 550 were put to death, following trial by various revolutionary courts. These executions, punctuated by cries of ''paredón'' (to the wall!), worried the liberals in Cuba and their sympathizers abroad, especially in the United States.&quot;; people were executed on Guevara's extra-judicial orders during this time.;Different sources cite different numbers of executions.

Later, Guevara became an official at the National Institute of Agrarian Reform, and President of the National Bank of Cuba. He signed all [http://www.banknotes.com/CU88.JPG Cuban banknotes] issued during his fourteen-month presidency with his nickname, &quot;Che&quot;.

During this time his fondness for chess was rekindled, and he attended and participated in most national and international tournaments held in Cuba.;chessgames.com, &quot;Miguel Najdorf vs Ernesto Che Guevara&quot;.

Even as early as 1959, Guevara helped organize revolutionary expeditions overseas, all of which failed. The first attempt was made in Panama; another in the Dominican Republic (led by Henry Fuerte,;Puerto Padre website, &quot;Cronologia&quot; (List of anniversaries)

In 1960 Guevara provided first aid to victims when the freighter ''La Coubre'', a French vessel carrying munitions from the port of Antwerp, exploded while it was being unloaded in Havana harbor. A rescue operation immediately ensued but went awry when a second explosion occurred, resulting in well over a hundred dead.;Cuban Information Archives, &quot;La Coubre explodes in Havana 1960.&quot; [http://cuban-exile.com/doc_151-175/doc0166.html Online], accessed February 26 2006; pictures can be seen at Cuban site [http://www.fotospl.com/Default.aspx?Class=23&amp;Epig=001~01&amp;PA=18 fotospl.com].; It was at the memorial service for the victims of this explosion that Alberto Korda took the most famous photograph of him.

Guevara later served as Minister of Industries, in which post he helped formulate Cuban socialism, and became one of the country's most prominent figures. In his book ''Guerrilla Warfare'', he advocated replicating the Cuban model of revolution initiated by a small group (''foco'') of guerrillas without the need for broad organizations to precede armed insurrection. His essay ''El socialismo y el hombre en Cuba'' (1965) (''Man and Socialism in Cuba'') advocates the need to shape a &quot;new man&quot; (''hombre nuevo'') in conjunction with a socialist state. Some saw Guevara as the simultaneously glamorous and austere model of that &quot;new man.&quot;

During the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion, Guevara did not participate in the fighting, having been ordered by Castro to a command post in Cuba's westernmost Pinar del Río Province|Pinar del Río province where he was involved in fending off a decoy force. He did, however, suffer a bullet wound to the face during this deployment, which he said had been caused by the accidental discharge of his own gun.;Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', ISBN 0-8021-1600-0, New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 508.;

Guevara played a key role in bringing to Cuba the Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles that precipitated the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. During an interview with the British newspaper ''Daily Worker'' some weeks later, he stated that, if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them against major U.S. cities.;Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', ISBN 0-8021-1600-0, New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 545: &quot;In an interview with Che a few weeks after the crisis, Sam Russell, a British correspondent for the socialist Daily Worker, found Guevara still fuming over the Soviet betrayal. Alternately puffing on a cigar and taking blasts from an inhaler, Guevara told Russell that if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off. Russell came away with mixed feelings about Che, calling him 'a warm character whom I took to immediately... clearly a man of great intelligence though I thought he was crackers from the way he went on about the missiles.'&quot;;

He also visited Pyongyang and told the press that North Korea was a model to which revolutionary Cuba should aspire.;Bruce Cumings, &quot;Korea’s Place in the Sun: A Modern History&quot;, updated edition, W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2005, p. 404.;

In Algiers on 24 February, 1965, he made what turned out to be his last public appearance on the international stage when he delivered a speech to the &quot;Second Economic Seminar on Afro-Asian Solidarity&quot; in which he declared, &quot;There are no frontiers in this struggle to the death. We cannot remain indifferent in the face of what occurs in any part of the world. A victory for any country against imperialism is our victory, just as any country's defeat is our defeat.&quot;;Ernesto Che Guevara, (editors Rolando E. Bonachea and Nelson P. Valdés), ''Che: Selected Works of Ernesto Guevara'', Cambridge, MA: 1969, p. 350.;;Ernesto Che Guevara, &quot;English Translation of Complete Text of Algiers Speech&quot;,

Valdés), ''Che: Selected Works of Ernesto Guevara'', Cambridge, MA: 1969, pp. 352-59.;; He returned to Cuba on 14 March to a solemn reception by Fidel and Raúl Castro, Osvaldo Dorticós and Carlos Rafael Rodríguez at the Havana airport.

Two weeks later, Guevara dropped out of public life and then vanished altogether. His whereabouts were the great mystery of 1965 in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself. His disappearance was variously attributed to the relative failure of the industrialization scheme he had advocated while minister of industry, to pressure exerted on Castro by Soviet officials disapproving of Guevara's pro-Chinese Communist bent as the Sino-Soviet split grew more pronounced, and to serious differences between Guevara and the Cuban leadership regarding Cuba's economic development and ideological line.;Guevara, Ernesto Che. ''The Great Debate on Political Economy'', New York: 2006, Ocean Press, 430 pages (entire book is devoted to this subject).;

Following the Cuban Missile Crisis and what he perceived as a Soviet betrayal of Cuba when Khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles from Cuban territory without consulting Castro, Guevara had grown increasingly skeptical of the Soviet Union. As revealed in his last speech in Algiers, he had come to view the Northern Hemisphere, led by the U.S. in the West and the Soviet Union in the East, as the exploiter of the Southern Hemisphere. He strongly supported Communist North Vietnam and the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War, and urged the peoples of other developing countries to take up arms and create &quot;100 Vietnams&quot;.;Ernesto Che Guevara, &quot;English Translation of Complete Text of his ''Message to the Tricontinental''&quot;, or see s:es:Mensaje a los Pueblos del Mundo|Original Spanish text at Wikisource.;Guevara with members of his &quot;reception committee&quot; at Havana airport;;(Havana - 14 March 1965).;

Pressed by international speculation regarding Guevara's fate, Castro stated on 16 June, 1965, that the people would be informed about Guevara when Guevara himself wished to let them know. Numerous rumors about his disappearance spread both inside and outside Cuba. On 3 October of that year, Castro revealed a hand written undated letter;Ernesto Che Guevara, &quot;Che Guevara's Farewell Letter&quot;, 1965. English translation of complete text: s:Che Guevara's Farewell Letter|Che Guevara's Farewell Letter at Wikisource.; purportedly written to him by Guevara some months earlier in which Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution but declared his intention to leave Cuba to fight abroad for the cause of the revolution. He explained that &quot;Other nations of the world summon my modest efforts,&quot; and that he had therefore decided to go and fight as a guerrilla &quot;on new battlefields&quot;. In the letter Guevara announced his resignation from all his positions in the government, in the party, and in the Army, and renounced his Cuban citizenship, which had been granted to him in 1959 in recognition of his efforts on behalf of the revolution.

During an interview with four foreign correspondents on 1 November, Castro remarked that he knew where Guevara was but would not disclose his location, and added, denying reports that his former comrade-in-arms was dead, that &quot;he is in the best of health.&quot; Despite Castro's assurances, Guevara's fate remained a mystery at the end of 1965 and his movements and whereabouts continued to be a closely held secret for the next two years.

Some sources state that Guevara persuaded Castro to back him in this effort, while other sources maintain that Castro convinced Guevara to undertake the mission, arguing that conditions in the various Latin American countries that had been under consideration for the possible establishment of guerrilla ''focos'' were not yet optimal.;Anderson, Jon Lee.

The Cuban operation was to be carried out in support of the pro-Patrice Lumumba Marxist Simba movement in the Congo-Kinshasa (formerly Belgian Congo, later Zaire and currently the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Guevara, his second-in-command Victor Dreke, and twelve of the Cuban expeditionaries arrived in the Congo on 24 April 1965; a contingent of approximately 100 Afro-Cubans joined them soon afterwards.;Gálvez, William.

''Cuba: A new history'', Yale University Press 2004, p219.; They collaborated for a time with guerrilla leader Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who helped Lumumba supporters lead a revolt that was suppressed in November of that same year by the Congolese army.

To his left is Santiago Terry (codename: &quot;Aly&quot;), to his right, Angel Felipe Hernández (&quot;Sitaini&quot;).

Although Guevara was thirty-seven at the time and had no formal military training, he had the experiences of the Cuban revolution, including his successful march on Santa Clara, which was central to Batista finally being overthrown by Castro's forces. His asthma had prevented him from being drafted into military service in Argentina, a fact of which he was proud given his opposition to Juan Perón|Perón's government.

South African mercenaries including Mike Hoare and Cuban exiles worked with the Congolese army to thwart Guevara. They were able to monitor his communications, arrange to ambush the rebels and the Cubans whenever they attempted to attack, and interdict his supply lines.;African History Blog, &quot;Che Guevara's Exploits in the Congo&quot;, [http://africanhistory.about.com/b/a/227091.htm Che Guevara's Exploits in the Congo Online at African History], accessed January 5 2006.;;Mad Mike Hoare Site, &quot;Mad Mike&quot;.

Guevara's aim was to export the Cuban Revolution by instructing local Simba fighters in communist ideology and foco strategies of guerrilla warfare. In his ''Congo Diary'', he cites the incompetence, intransigence, and infighting of the local Congolese forces as the key reasons for the revolt's failure.;Ireland's Own, &quot;From Cuba to Congo, Dream to Disaster for Che Guevara&quot;. [http://irelandsown.net/Che2.html Online at irelandsown.net], accessed January 11 2006.; Later that same year, ill with dysentery, suffering from his asthma, and disheartened after seven months of frustrations, Guevara left the Congo with the Cuban survivors (six members of his column had died). At one point Guevara had considered sending the wounded back to Cuba, then standing alone and fighting until the end in the Congo as a revolutionary example; however, after being urged by his comrades in arms and pressured by two emissaries sent by Castro, at the last moment he reluctantly agreed to leave the Congo. A few weeks later, when writing the preface to the diary he had kept during the Congo venture, he began it with the words: &quot;This is the history of a failure.&quot;;Ernesto Che Guevara, translated from the Spanish by Patrick Camiller, ''The African Dream'', New York: Grove Publishers, 2000, p.1.;

=Interlude=
Because Castro had made public Guevara's &quot;farewell letter&quot;; to him &amp;mdash; a letter Guevara had intended should only be revealed in case of his death &amp;mdash; wherein he had written that he was severing all ties to Cuba in order to devote himself to revolutionary activities in other parts of the world, he felt that he could not return to Cuba with the other surviving combatants for moral reasons, and he spent the next six months living clandestinely in Dar-es-Salaam, and Prague. During this time he compiled his memoirs of the Congo experience, and wrote the drafts of two more books, one on philosophy;Ernesto Che Guevara, ''Apuntes Filosóficos'', draft.; and the other on economics.;Ernesto Che Guevara, ''Notas Económicas'', draft.; He also visited several countries in Western Europe in order to &quot;test&quot; a new false identity and the corresponding documentation (passport, etc.) created for him by Cuban Intelligence that he planned to use to travel to South America. Throughout this period Castro continued to importune him to return to Cuba, but Guevara only agreed to do so when it was understood that he would be there on a strictly temporary basis for the few months needed to prepare a new revolutionary effort somewhere in Latin America, and that his presence on the island would be cloaked in the tightest secrecy.

Bolivia
=Insurgent=
;Map of Bolivia showing location of Vallegrande.
Speculation on Guevara's whereabouts continued throughout 1966 and into 1967. Representatives of the Mozambican independence movement FRELIMO reported meeting with Guevara in late 1966 or early 1967 in Dar es Salaam, at which point they rejected his offer of aid in their revolutionary project.;Mittleman, James H. ''Underdevelopment and the Transition to Socialism - Mozambique and Tanzania'', New York: 1981, Academic Press, p. 38.; In a speech at the 1967 May Day rally in Havana, the Acting Minister of the armed forces, Major Juan Almeida, announced that Guevara was &quot;serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America&quot;. The persistent reports that he was leading the guerrillas in Bolivia were eventually shown to be true.

At Castro's behest, a 3,700 acre parcel of jungle land in the remote Ñancahuazú region had been purchased by native Bolivian Communists for Guevara to use as a training area and base camp. The evidence suggests that the training at this camp in the Ñancahuazú valley was more hazardous than combat to Guevara and the Cubans accompanying him. Little was accomplished in the way of building a guerrilla army. Former Stasi operative Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider, better known by her ''nom de guerre'' &quot;Tania&quot;, who had been installed as his primary agent in La Paz, was reportedly also working for the KGB and is widely inferred to have unwittingly served Soviet interests by leading Bolivian authorities to Guevara's trail.;Major Donald R. Selvage - USMC, &quot;Che Guevara in Bolivia&quot;, 1 April 1985. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SDR.htm Online at GlobalSecurity.org], accessed January 5 2006.; The numerous photographs taken by and of Guevara and other members of his guerrilla group that they left behind at their base camp after the initial clash with the Bolivian army in March 1967 provided President René Barrientos with the first proof of his presence in Bolivia; after viewing them, Barrientos allegedly stated that he wanted Guevara's head displayed on a pike in downtown La Paz. He thereupon ordered the Bolivian Army to hunt Guevara and his followers down.

Guevara's guerrilla force, numbering about 50 and operating as the ELN (''Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Bolivia''; English: &quot;National Liberation Army of Bolivia&quot;), was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against Bolivian regulars in the difficult terrain of the mountainous Camiri region. In September, however, the Army managed to eliminate two guerrilla groups, reportedly killing one of the leaders.

Despite the violent nature of the conflict, Guevara gave medical attention to all of the wounded Bolivian soldiers whom the guerrillas took prisoner, and subsequently released them. Even after his last battle at the Quebrada del Yuro, in which he had been wounded, when he was taken to a temporary holding location and saw there a number of Bolivian soldiers who had also been wounded in the fighting, he offered to give them medical care. His offer was turned down by the Bolivian officer in charge.;Taibo, Paco Ignacio II. ''Ernesto Guevara, también conocido como el Che'', Barcelona, 1999: Editorial Planeta, p 726.;

Guevara's plan for fomenting revolution in Bolivia appears to have been based upon a number of misconceptions:
*He had expected to deal only with the country's military government and its poorly trained and equipped army. However, after the U.S. government learned of his location, CIA and other operatives were sent into Bolivia to aid the anti-insurrection effort. The Bolivian Army was being trained and supplied by U.S. Army Special Forces advisors, including a recently organized elite battalion of Rangers trained in jungle warfare that set up camp in La Esperanza, a small settlement close to the guerrillas' zone of operations.;U.S. Army, &quot;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB5/che14_1.htm Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Activation, Organization and Training of the 2d Ranger Battalion – Bolivian Army (28 April 1967)]&quot;. Accessed June 19 2006.;;Ryan, Henry Butterfield. '' The Fall of Che Guevara : A Story of Soldiers, Spies, and Diplomats'', New York, 1998: Oxford University Press, p 82–102, inter alia.;
*Guevara had expected assistance and cooperation from the local dissidents. He did not receive it; and Bolivia's Communist Party, under the leadership of Mario Monje, was oriented towards Moscow rather than Havana and did not aid him, despite having promised to do so. Some members of the Bolivian Communist Party did join/support him, such as Coco and Inti Peredo, Rodolfo Saldaña, Serapio Aquino Tudela, and Antonio Jiménez Tardio, against the Party leadership's wishes.
*He had expected to remain in radio contact with Havana. However, the two shortwave transmitters provided to him by Cuba were faulty, so that the guerrillas were unable to communicate with Havana. In this, and in many other respects, Manuel Piñeiro, the man to whom Castro had assigned the task of coordinating support for Guevara's operations in Bolivia, performed abysmally. To further complicate matters, some months into the campaign, the tape recorder that the guerrillas used to record and decipher the one-time pad-encoded radio messages sent to them from Havana was lost while crossing a river, making de-coding such messages more difficult.

In addition, his penchant for confrontation rather than compromise appears to have contributed to his inability to develop successful working relationships with local leaders in Bolivia, just as it had in the Congo.;Ernesto Che Guevara, &quot;Excerpt from ''Pasajes de la guerra revolucionaria: Congo''&quot;, [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&amp;fuseaction=va2.document&amp;identifier=5034C64B-96B6-175C-97A3C636C37896FB&amp;sort=Collection&amp;item=The%20Cold%20War%20in%20Africa Online at Cold War International History Project], accessed April 26 2006.; This tendency had surfaced during his guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba as well, but had been kept in check there by the timely interventions and guidance of Castro.;Castañeda, Jorge G.

On 8 October, the encampment was encircled, and Guevara was captured while leading a detachment with Simeón Cuba Sarabia in the Quebrada del Yuro ravine. According to some soldiers present at the capture, during the skirmish as they approached Guevara, he allegedly shouted, &quot;Do not shoot!

He later claimed Che had told him, &quot;Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and worth more to you alive than dead.&quot;; Upon hearing of Guevara's capture, Rodríguez relayed the information to CIA headquarters at Langley, Virginia, via CIA stations in various South American nations.

Barrientos promptly ordered his execution upon being informed of his capture. Guevara was taken to a dilapidated schoolhouse in the nearby village of La Higuera where he was held overnight. Early the next afternoon he was executed. The executioner was Mario Terán, a Sergeant in the Bolivian army who had drawn a short straw after arguments over who got the honor of killing Guevara broke out among the soldiers. To make the bullet wounds appear consistent with the official story sold to the public, Felix Rodriguez, the CIA asset, ordered the soldier who pulled the trigger to aim carefully to make it appear that Che had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army, and thus to help cover up the official secret assassination.;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7027619.stm CIA man recounts Che Guevara's death]&quot;, BBC News, October 8, 2007.; Guevara received multiple shots to the legs, so as to avoid maiming his face for identification purposes and simulate combat wounds in an attempt to conceal his extrajudicial execution.

Che Guevara had some last words before his death; he allegedly said to his executioner, &quot;I know you are here to kill me. Shoot, coward, you are only going to kill a man&quot;. Another alleged comment was &quot;Do you know Who I am? Do you know what I'm worth?&quot;;Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life''.

Electronic Briefing Book No. 5 [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB5/index.html Online], accessed March 25 2007.; After a military doctor surgically amputated his hands, Bolivian army officers transferred Guevara's cadaver to an undisclosed location and refused to reveal whether his remains had been buried or cremated.

On October 15, Castro acknowledged that Guevara was dead and proclaimed three days of public mourning throughout Cuba. The death of Guevara was regarded as a severe blow to the socialist revolutionary movements in Latin America and the rest of the third world.

Photographs taken at that time gave rise to legends such as those of ''San Ernesto de La Higuera'' and ''[http://elnuevocojo.com/Galerias/Che_Guevara/38.html El Cristo de Vallegrande]''.

=''The Bolivian Diary''=
Also removed when Guevara was captured was his diary, which documented events of the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia.;Ernesto Che Guevara, ''&quot;Diario (Bolivia)&quot;''. [http://www.uco.es/~i62guigm/che/diario.htm Online], accessed February 26 2006.; The first entry is on November 7 1966 shortly after his arrival at the farm in Ñancahuazú, and the last entry is on October 7 1967, the day before his capture. The diary tells how the guerrillas were forced to begin operations prematurely due to discovery by the Bolivian Army, explains Guevara's decision to divide the column into two units that were subsequently unable to reestablish contact, and describes their overall failure. It records the rift between Guevara and the Bolivian Communist Party that resulted in Guevara having significantly fewer soldiers than originally anticipated. It shows that Guevara had a great deal of difficulty recruiting from the local populace, due in part to the fact that the guerrilla group had learned Quechua rather than the local language which was Tupí-Guaraní. As the campaign drew to an unexpected close, Guevara became increasingly ill. He suffered from ever-worsening bouts of asthma, and most of his last offensives were carried out in an attempt to obtain medicine.

The Bolivian Diary was quickly and crudely translated by ''Ramparts'' magazine and circulated around the world. There are at least four additional diaries in existence &amp;mdash; those of Israel Reyes Zayas (Alias &quot;Braulio&quot;), Harry Villegas Tamayo (&quot;Pombo&quot;), Eliseo Reyes Rodriguez (&quot;Rolando&quot;);Major Donald R.

Typically, responses to Guevara's legacy followed partisan lines. The U.S. State Department was advised that his death would come as a relief to non-leftist Latin Americans, who had feared possible insurgencies in their own countries.; Subsequent analysts have also shed light on aspects of cruelty in Guevara’s methods, and analysed what Fidel Castro described as Guevara’s “excessively aggressive quality”.;Fidel Castro on Che Guevara : Speech by Fidel Castro was given on October 18, 1967.

The poor ''guajiro'' was so humiliated he began crying. Boti went back to talk to Che, telling him that he had been wrong to be so harsh, to go back and talk like a man, to lift his spirits again. Such episodes were commonplace.&quot;; Though much opposition to Guevara's methods has come from the political right, critical evaluation has also come from groups such as anarchists, Trotskyists, and civil libertarians, who consider Guevara an authoritarian, anti-working-class Stalinist, whose legacy was the creation of a more bureaucratic, authoritarian regime.;Libertarian Community, &quot;[http://libcom.org/history/guevara-ernesto-che-1928-1967 Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara, 1928–1967]&quot;.; Detractors have also theorized that in much of Latin America, Che-inspired revolutions had the practical result of reinforcing brutal militarism for many years.;The Killing Machine: Che Guevara, from Communist Firebrand to Capitalist Brand.

Legacy in Cuba
Monumental image on Cuban Ministry of the Interior, based on Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick's graphic of Alberto Korda's March 1960 photo. During Guevara's tenure as Media:Cheministro.png|Minister of the Ministry of Industries (MININD) from 1961 to 1965, this building was the MININD's headquarters and his office was on the top floor.In Cuba, Guevara's death precipitated the abandonment of guerrilla warfare as an instrument of foreign policy, ushering in a ''rapprochement'' with the Soviet Union, and the reformation of the government along Soviet lines. When Cuban troops returned to Africa in the 1970s, it was as part of a large-scale military expedition, and support for insurrection movements in Latin America and the Caribbean became logistical and organizational rather than overt. Cuba also abandoned Guevara's plans for economic diversification and rapid industrialization which had ultimately proved to be impracticable in view of the country's incorporation into the COMECON system. As early as 1965, the Yugoslav communist journal Borba observed the many half-completed or empty factories in Cuba, a legacy of Guevara's tenure as Minister of Industries, &quot;standing like sad memories of the conflict between pretension and reality&quot;.;Hugh Thomas. Cuba : The pursuit of freedom p. 1007.;

The Cuban state continued to cultivate Guevara’s cult of personality, constructing numerous statues and artworks in his honor throughout the land; adorning school rooms, workplaces, public buildings, billboards, and money with his image.;&quot;Cuba's face&quot;. Stanford University Germanic Collections.[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/german/exhibit/GDRposters/che.html Online]. Accessed October 24 2006.; Children across the country begin each school day with the chant &quot;''¡Pioneros por el Comunismo, Seremos como el Che!''&quot; (English: Pioneers for Communism, We will be like Che!). Guevara's mausoleum in Santa Clara has become a site of almost religious significance to many Cubans,; while the nation’s burgeoning tourist industry has benefited greatly from the ongoing international interest in Guevara's life. Some 205,832 people visited the mausoleum during 2004, of whom 127,597 were foreigners.

Legacy in Cuban-American Community
Reverence among Cubans for Guevara's memory is by no means universal. Many Cuban exiles have spoken of Guevara in less than favorable terms, and he is remembered by some as the &quot;The Butcher of La Cabaña Fortress|la Cabaña&quot;, a reference to Guevara’s post-revolutionary role as “supreme prosecutor” at the Cabaña fortress. The epithet was repeated by Cuban-born musician Paquito D'Rivera, who wrote an open letter castigating fellow musician Carlos Santana, for wearing a T-shirt displaying Guevara’s image to the 2005 Academy Awards ceremony.;Paquito D'Rivera, &quot;Open letter to Carlos Santana by Paquito D'Rivera in Latin Beat Magazine&quot;, 25 March 2005.
