Chong Chul Rhee, 8th ''dan'', is the founder and head of Rhee Taekwon-Do. Rhee holds the title &quot;World Master&quot; and claims the title &quot;Father of Australian Taekwondo.&quot;;;;; He is one of the twelve original masters of taekwondo;[http://www.itfnz.org.nz/ref/documents/masters.htm A tribute to the original masters] Retrieved on 13 June 2007.; selected from the South Korean military to develop taekwondo under Hong Hi Choi in the Korea Taekwon-Do Association (KTA). Rhee is a former unarmed combat instructor in the Korean Marines, and helped introduce the art of taekwondo to Southeast Asia (notably in Malaysia and Singapore) before becoming the first taekwondo master sent to Australia by the Republic of Korea.

Rhee has worked towards the reunification of Korea, serving as a member during the third through ninth terms—and as Chairman for the eighth term—of the Oceania Division of the Advisory Council for Democratic and Peaceful Unification.;[http://www.acdpuoceania.com/formal_chairman_e.html Former Chairmen of the ODCC] Retrieved on 24 April 2003; link has expired, as at 15 July 2007.; He has also served as Chairman of the Seoul Olympics Supporting Committee and founding President of the Korean Community Hall Construction Supporting Committee.; The Republic of Korea awarded Rhee the Dongbaeg Medal (''동백장'') in 2003 for promoting taekwondo and Korean culture over the past 33 years.;

Two of Rhee's brothers also hold the title of Master in Rhee Taekwon-Do, and assist him in managing parts of the school:

Significance

Rhee Taekwon-Do occupies a prominent place in Australian taekwondo history. This is reflected in three key claims:;; (1) Rhee is the Father of Australian Taekwondo, (2) Rhee Taekwon-Do is the first taekwondo school in Australia, and (3) Rhee Taekwon-Do is the biggest taekwondo school in Australia. The school has widely publicised these claims since at least the 1980s.

= Father of Australian Taekwondo=

No one has challenged Rhee's claim as the Father of Australian Taekwondo. The title might be debated, however, based on claims made about four other martial art masters:

Kim might be considered the first taekwondo instructor in Australia, and so might lay claim to the title. He did not establish a taekwondo school in Australia.

(1996): &quot;Fighting frames,&quot; ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 4(4):53.; it later became the Melbourne Taekwondo Centre. As Rozinsky taught tang soo do there, he might be considered the first taekwondo school founder in Australia, and so might lay claim to the title. He did not introduce taekwondo outside Victoria.

* Terence Walsh, 8th ''dan'' (World Kido Federation), claims to have introduced taekwondo to New South Wales in 1969.;Walsh, T. F. (1999): &quot;Grandmaster Kwang Sung Hang: Taekwondo pioneer,&quot; ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 8(3):48–50.;;[http://www.walshtkd.com/ Walsh Martial Arts Australia] Retrieved on 14 June 2007.; If he was the first to introduce taekwondo to Australia's most populous state, then he might lay claim to the title. He did not introduce taekwondo outside the eastern states.

* Young Ku Yun, 8th ''dan'' (ITF), has been described as having introduced taekwondo to Sydney in 1971.;Anon. (1997): &quot;Grandmaster Yun: The changing face of martial arts,&quot; ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 6(2):9–12.; If he was the first to introduce taekwondo to Australia's largest city, then he might lay claim to the title. He arrived around five years after Rhee, however, and himself claimed to be the first ITF instructor (rather than the first taekwondo instructor) in Australia.;[http://www.yunjungdo.com.au/ Yun Jung Do] Retrieved on 21 June 2007.;

Kim would have been in the lower ''dan'' ranks, and would not yet have held the title of Master, when he was invited to teach in Australia. Rozinsky and Walsh would have held 1st ''dan'' ranking in the 1960s. Both Rhee (KTA) and Yun (ITF) would have been in the middle ''dan'' ranks and held the title of Master when they arrived, as they were sent to Australia by their respective Korean governing bodies.

Rhee Taekwon-Do's position as the first taekwondo school in Australia might be challenged by the Melbourne Taekwondo Centre (originally the Shuto Karate Club),; as tang soo do was one of the arts taught there.

Rhee Taekwon-Do's position as the biggest taekwondo school in Australia is supported by independently-verifiable listings of ''dojang''.;; The claim might be disputed if the Australian members of the ITF and the WTF were considered as 'schools' as a whole, but Rhee Taekwon-Do is a single school under the direct leadership of Rhee while both the ITF;[http://www.itftkd.org/fileadmin/archive/commons/20070508_ITF_Constitution.pdf International Taekwon-Do Federation Constitution (28 April 2007)] (ITF-NK, Chang) Retrieved on 26 August 2007.;;[http://www.itf-administration.com/constitution.asp International Taekwon-Do Federation Constitution] (ITF-C, Choi) Retrieved on 26 August 2007.; and WTF;[http://www.wtf.org/site/about_wtf/organization.htm World Taekwondo Federation organizational chart] Retrieved on 26 August 2007.; are groups of schools (each with its own head) under a larger governing body.

Ex-Rhee members

At least 20 founders of Australian martial art schools (and at least one in New Zealand) received their foundational taekwondo training in Rhee Taekwon-Do or are former Rhee Taekwon-Do instructors. Of these ex-members, the highest-ranked was a Rhee Taekwon-Do 4th ''dan'' instructor when he left Rhee's school.

Training

A Rhee Taekwon-Do self-defence drill to practise deflecting an incoming punch aimed at the face

Rhee Taekwon-Do training consists of exercises that may be classified as: basics (group drill exercises; similar to ''kihon'' in karate), destruction (breaking), hyung (patterns or forms), self-defence, and sparring. Basics, destruction, hyung, and self-defence are similar to equivalent exercises in other traditional martial art schools. Rhee Taekwon-Do sparring is different to that in ITF and WTF schools, having more in common with Kumite#Delivering_strikes|traditional karate sparring.

Rhee Taekwon-Do sparring is unscored, unarmoured,;Anon. (1993): &quot;Master Rhee: Interview by a special reporter,&quot; ''Rhee Taekwondo'', Autumn 1993:4–5.; and usually 'non-contact' in principle. Members typically achieve non-contact sparring by two methods, whether separately or in combination:

* The attacker consciously stops just short of hitting the training partner, while still executing attacks with full speed and power.;;Lofthouse, D. (1993): &quot;No contact,&quot; ''Rhee Taekwondo'', Summer 1993:7.; The attacker has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs when one training partner has more experience than the other.

* The defender actively avoids or blocks an incoming attack executed by the training partner.;Coleman, A. (1993): &quot;Effective self-defence is learnt through non-contact sparring,&quot; ''Rhee Taekwondo'', Summer 1993:31.; The defender has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs with training partners of similar experience.

Ranks

A twin knife-hand strike into two stacks of roof tiles as part of a Rhee Taekwon-Do 2nd ''dan'' grading test

Rhee Taekwon-Do ranks are denoted by coloured belts, which indicate a member's level of experience and responsibility within the school. There are ten coloured belt grades, or ''kup'' ranks (급), and nine black belt degrees, or ''dan'' ranks (단).;See any ''Rhee Taekwon-Do'' membership booklet.;

Members start with white belts and progress through yellow, green, blue, brown, and then black. 'Tips' denoting odd-numbered ''kup'' ranks are marked by a stripe of the higher colour near the right end (from the wearer's point of view) of a belt of the lower colour. ''Dan'' ranks are represented by a white bars embroidered on a black belt. A black belt with no bars is a Junior Black Belt, a rank assigned to members considered too young for 1st ''dan''.

To attain Rhee Taekwon-Do 1st ''dan'' ranking typically takes around five years of regular training. Progression through the school's ''dan'' ranks is by invitation,;Anon. (2006): &quot;Juliette presented with high honour from World Master,&quot; ''Maryborough Herald'' (10 May 2006), p. 21.; and is usually slower than in other taekwondo schools. Promotion to 2nd ''dan'' might come after 10–15 years, in which time someone might have reached 4th ''dan'' (ITF);Choi, H. H. (1993): ''Taekwon-Do: The Korean art of self-defence, 3rd ed.'' (Vol. 1, p. 94). Mississauga: International Taekwon-Do Federation.; or 5th ''dan'' (WTF).;[http://www.kukkiwon.or.kr/english/examination/examination08.jsp?div=01 Kukkiwon promotion test regulations (Article 8)] Retrieved on 19 July 2007.; Promotion to 3rd ''dan'' might come after 20–25 years, in which time someone might have reached 6th ''dan'' (ITF); or 7th ''dan'' (WTF).; Several former Rhee Taekwon-Do instructors who joined other taekwondo organisations received new ranks consistent with these approximations.

Notes

;
 &quot;Rhee Taekwon-Do&quot; is the spelling used in the earliest versions of the school's logo. All four spellings appear in official Rhee Taekwon-Do documentation and on Rhee Taekwon-Do uniforms.

 Rhee Taekwon-Do has also operated in other parts of Oceania in the past, such as Papua New Guinea. In 2007, the school appears to operate exclusively in Australia and New Zealand.

 Vernon Low, 6th ''dan'', also holds the title of Master in Rhee Taekwon-Do. He is in charge of the school's South Australian operations, and is known as Rhee's number one student.

 While discussing the introduction of taekwondo to Malaysia and Singapore, Ki Ha Rhee noted that Choi had instructed him to bring another instructor with him. Almost certainly referring to C. H. Rhee, he added, &quot;That's why I took the brother of Rhee Chong Chul—from Rhee International—he was the first to graduate so he came to Malaysia then I brought him to Singapore&quot; (p. 52).;Anon. (2007): &quot;In the words of a master: GM Rhee Ki Ha, 9th Dan,&quot; ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 16(3):50–54.;

 The Korean striking art taught by Kim, Rozinsky, and No in the 1960s was described as tang soo do; or Korean karate,; and not as taekwondo. It is a matter of interpretation whether the art should be called taekwondo retrospectively. The Shuto Karate Club (founded by Rozinsky in 1963); later became the Melbourne Taekwondo Centre, and tang soo do was one of the arts taught there. Rhee was the first to use the name &quot;taekwondo&quot; officially in Australia.
