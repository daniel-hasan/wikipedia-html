The spider family Hexathelidae, the only family in the super-family Hexatheloidea, is one of two families (along with ''Funnel-web tarantula|Dipluridae'') of spiders known as funnel-web tarantulas.This order is sometimes referred to as the venomous funnel-web tarantulas, due to the inclusion of the Australasian funnel-web spiders, including the notorious ''Atrax robustus'', or Sydney funnel-web spider, but not all specimens in Hexathelidae are dangerous to humans. 

Description
These spiders are medium-to-large in size, with body lengths ranging from 1cm to 5cm (0.4&quot; to 2&quot;). The body is typically three times longer than it is wide. They are darkly colored, ranging from black to brown, with a glossy carapace covering the front part of the body. Like the related Funnel-web tarantula|diplurid spiders, the hexathelids have generally long spinnerets; this is especially true of ''A. robustus''.The eyes of these spiders are close together.

Like other Mygalomorphae, (also called the ''Orthognatha'' an infraorder of spiders which includes the true tarantulas), these spiders have fangs which point straight down and do not cross each other (cf araneomorph).They have ample poison glands that lie entirely within their chelicerae. Their chelicerae and fangs are large and powerful.Although they are rather small compared to the true tarantulas, as venomous specimens they should not be handled without taking substantial precautions because their fangs have been known to penetrate fingernails and soft shoes, resulting in dangerous bites.

Range and habitat
Most hexathelids are found in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. One species is known for the Mediterranean region and two from South America. Two species occur in Central Africa.

Hexathelids typically live in burrows, which are constructed in the ground or in tree hollows.An elaborately constructed burrow entrance is common.These spiders construct a funnel shaped web and lurk for prey in the small end of the funnel. They frequently search for a place to nest under human dwellings, or under nearby rocks, logs, or other similar objects. They are most active at night.

Medical significance
There are three genera known to contain dangerous spiders--''Atrax'' and ''Hadronyche'' of Australia and the south Pacific, and ''Macrothele'', which contains some specimens considered dangerous in Taiwan and parts of eastern Asia.
