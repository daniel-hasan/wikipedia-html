''Chef Aid: The South Park Album'' is an album based on the Chef Aid episode of South Park.

The album was available with 2 collectible covers and in three different versions &amp;mdash; &quot;Clean&quot;, &quot;Explicit&quot;, and &quot;Extreme&quot;. The explicit version contained profanities (including &quot;fuck&quot;) and carried a Parental Advisory sticker, but it was still censored, most notably on the tracks &quot;Nowhere to Run,&quot; &quot;Will They Die 4 You,&quot; &quot;Bubblegoose,&quot; &quot;Wake Up Wendy&quot; (specifically the tail end of it &amp;mdash; which is the intro to &quot;Horny&quot;), &quot;Horny&quot;, and &quot;Mentally Dull,&quot; even censoring lesser profanities such as &quot;shit&quot;. The Extreme version was completely uncensored.
