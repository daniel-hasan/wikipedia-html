The February-March 2007 Tornado Outbreak was a tornado outbreak across the southern United States that began in Kansas on February 28, 2007. The severe weather spread eastward on March 1 and left a deadly mark across the southern US, particularly in Alabama and Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia. 20 deaths were reported, one in Missouri, nine in Georgia and 10 in Alabama. Scattered severe weather was also reported in North Carolina on March 2 producing a possible tornado before the storms moved offshore into the Atlantic Ocean.;;

In the end, there were 57 tornadoes confirmed during the outbreak, including three EF3 tornadoes reported across three states, as well as three EF4 tornadoes; two in Alabama and one in Kansas, the first such tornadoes since the introduction of the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Total damages exceeded $520 million. Insured losses in the state of Georgia topped $210 million, making this outbreak the costliest in that state's history.;; Enterprise, Alabama, which was hit the hardest, sustained damages in excess of $307 million.;;

Meteorological synopsis
The tornado outbreak was related to a large low-pressure system across the central United States that intensified on February 28 while over Kansas, and a cold front moved across the region, providing the lift needed to allow the storms to develop. In addition, a surge of very moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and warm temperatures across the south side of the storm helped feed the storms. Temperatures were in the 70s°F (low 20s°C) in some areas to the south, while the mercury was below freezing on the north side. The dewpoints were in the 60 °F (16 °C) range as far north as southeastern Kansas, which provided extra fuel.;;

A moderate risk of severe storms was issued by the Storm Prediction Center for February 28 across parts of the central Plains. The first tornadoes developed early in the evening of February 28 in Kansas as the dry line pushed eastward and was lifted by the cold front.;; In total, 12 tornadoes formed that evening across Kansas and Missouri, of which 11 were weak. However, one of the tornadoes was an EF4, the first such tornado recorded and the first violent tornado since Late-September 2006 Tornado Outbreak|September 22, 2006. Fortunately, no one was injured that evening. Farther south, though, expected activity in Oklahoma and Arkansas did not take place as the atmospheric cap held up.;;

A high risk of severe storms - the first such issuance since April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak|April 7, 2006 - was issued for a large part of the Deep South for March 1 as the cold front moved eastward.;; The activity began almost immediately, with several isolated tornadoes taking place that morning across the Mississippi Valley, with one of them leading to the first fatality of the outbreak. Isolated tornadoes were also reported as far north as Illinois near the center of the low. However, the most intense activity began around noon and continued throughout the afternoon and evening, with southern Alabama and southern Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia being the hardest hit. Nearly continuous supercells formed north of the Gulf of Mexico and produced many tornadoes, some of which hit large population centers with devastating effects. 19 people were killed by those tornadoes.;;

The squall line finally overtook the supercells just after midnight on March 2 after putting down 37 tornadoes that day. As the squall line overtook the cells, a few tornadoes - all EF0 - took place overnight in Florida and extreme southern Georgia within the squall line before the severe weather emerged in the Atlantic Ocean that morning.;; The final tornado was a landfalling waterspout in the Outer Banks of North Carolina late that morning.;; In addition to the tornadoes, widespread straight-line wind damage from microbursts were also reported, along with scattered severe hail, the largest of which were the size of baseballs.;;

On the other side of the low pressure area, a significant blizzard occurred over the northern Great Plains and Upper Midwest including parts of Minnesota, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Wisconsin, Iowa and Nebraska where several snowfalls in excess of 8 to 18 inches (20—45 cm) were reported and between 6 and 11 inches (15—28 cm) across portions of Ontario and Quebec;; .Freezing rain was reported across New England, the lower Great Lakes in Ontario, Michigan and in the Chicago area. 19 people were killed by the storm including two in Manitoba;; , two in Ontario;;, one in Massachusetts four in North Dakota, one in Minnesota, three in Michigan, five in Wisconsin and one in Nebraska;;. The University of Minnesota in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities was closed for the first time since 1991 and the roof of a supermarket in Wisconsin collapsed. Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty called in the National Guard while governors Chet Culver (Iowa) and Michael Rounds (South Dakota) issued disaster declarations;;

Early on the afternoon of Thursday, March 1, at 1:08 pm CST (1908 UTC), a destructive tornado first developed near the Enterprise Municipal Airport. The tornado lifted off the ground briefly before returning to the ground as an even stronger storm.;; It quickly slammed into Enterprise, Alabama at 1:12 pm CST (1912 UTC). The tornado left severe damage throughout a large section of the city. The most severe damage took place at Enterprise High School, where a section of the school was destroyed during the middle of the school day. At least eight fatalities were reported at the school and 50 others were taken to local hospitals. Some early reports suggested that there had been as many as 15 deaths at Enterprise High School and 18 deaths statewide, which was found to be an over-estimation.;; It was the first killer tornado at a US school since the Plainfield Tornado in Illinois in 1990, and the deadliest definite tornado since one in Belvidere, Illinois in 1967.;; One other death was reported in Enterprise at a nearby private residence when her living room was shattered by the tornado.;;;;

US President G.W. Bush surveys tornado damage to Enterprise High School from Marine One.
At the school, the fatalities resulted from the collapse of a concrete wall. One hallway completely collapsed, trapping many students in the rubble just outside the music room. The tornado at the school was so strong that it flipped cars over in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1 pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.;;

Nearby Hillcrest Elementary School also sustained severe damaged from the tornado. After the tornado hit, students from both schools that were not injured were relocated by emergency personnel to Hillcrest Baptist Church, adjacent to the school which was not damaged, in order to meet up with shocked parents. Emergency personnel also rushed to the school to send the most seriously injured to local hospitals and provide treatment on the scene to others.;

The tornado initially formed in a neighborhood just south of the downtown area; after demolishing a section of the downtown area it moved on to the schools. The tornado then continued northeast crossing the Holly Hill and Dixie Drive areas. A quarter mile (400 m) wide swath was devastated, with enormous damage reported to many houses and businesses, some of which were flattened. Several other schools and the local YMCA were among the damaged buildings.; In total, at least 370 houses were damaged or destroyed, according to Mayor Kenneth Boswell.;;

The tornado itself was estimated to have been 500 yards (450 m) wide and had a path length of 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km). It dissipated shortly after leaving Enterprise.; It was given an initial rating of EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.;; However, after a detailed survey, the tornado was upgraded to a low-end EF4 with winds around 170 mph (275&amp;nbsp;km/h) due to flattened houses near the school.;;

President Bush talks with the media after walking through the tornado damage at Enterprise High School.
=Aftermath=
The National Guard was called into Enterprise in the aftermath of the tornado. Governor Bob Riley mobilized about 100 troops and placed more on standby. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed on the community after the tornado hit due to the extensive damage.;; On the morning of March 3, President George W. Bush visited the community and declared Coffee County a disaster area. He went into the school and also took an aerial view of the devastation.; FEMA was also called in to provide additional assistance.

After the tornado, it was debated on whether the students should have indeed been dismissed before the tornado hit. However, the National Weather Service survey from the office in Tallahassee suggested that the death toll could have been much higher due to the extreme damage in the parking lot and the area nearby.;; In addition, earlier thunderstorm activity in the area with two other rotating supercells tracking towards Enterprise late that morning (the first tornado warning was issued at 10:41 am CST) made evacuating the area unsafe.;;

In a later service assessment done by the NWS, it was determined that the school had taken the appropriate safety precautions to minimize and prevent potential loss of life with the tornado approaching, and the students were indeed in the safest part of the building. However, it was recommended in the assessment that hardened &quot;safe rooms&quot; with enhanced construction to prevent future disasters in the event of large and violent tornadoes impacting large buildings. A similar tornado on July 13, 2004 in Roanoke, Illinois destroyed an industrial building, yet such rooms were used and no one there was seriously injured.;
