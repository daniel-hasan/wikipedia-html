Mustafa Denizli (born November 10, 1949 in İzmir, Turkey) is a Turkish former football player and an international coach.

Playing career
He spent 17 years with his hometown club Altay SK in İzmir, gaining a reputation as one of the best left-sided forwards in the league. In 1980, he became topscorer with 12 goals. Denizli transferred then in 1983 to Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray, but retired at the end of the season 1983-1984 from active sport. During his playing time, he was capped 10 times for the national team.

Managerial career
He started his next career as the assistant coach to German Jupp Derwall and served three years in this position at Galatasaray. In 1987, he took over his master’s position as coach. For the same season, Denizli was appointed head coach of the Turkish national football team. In the season 1988-1989, he reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League with Galatasaray, but the road to the final was blocked by Steaua Bucuresti.

For the season 1989-1990, Denizli signed a contract with the German second league side Alemannia Aachen. Denizli had installed a new type of attacking football for the German club but he left from this club due to Alemannia Aachen was faced with relegation to third league. Returned back to Turkey after one season, he was responsible for Galatasaray again. The team won Turkish Cup under his management in 1991-1992 and played in the quarter finals of the Cup Winners Cup. From 1992 to 1995, he coached Kocaelispor and then he was appointed the second time head coach for the national team, he served until 2000. At the 2000 European Football Championship, Turkey played quarter finals with him, first time ever in the country’s history. 

In 2000, Fenerbahçe offered him a position, and at the end of the season 2000-2001, Fenerbahçe won the league championship title after 5 years again. Denizli is the first Turkish coach of Fenerbahçe ever to win the league championship, but he enjoyed a rather poor Champions League run with defeats against FC Barcelona and Bayer Leverkusen. In 2002 the Nigerian national football team wanted to sign Denizli for their 2002 World Cup campaign but due to several problems it was canceld. He then transferred to Vestel Manisaspor. 

In 2004, Denizli received several offers from Japan and South-Korea, but he chose to use his knowledge for Iran to coach the premier league champion Pas Tehran. Denizli made a run for the league title but became only second in the league. There were rumours that Denizli would be the coach of the Iran national football team to lead it to a successful 2006 World Cup. He also reached the quarterfinals of the AFC Champions League with Pas, where he was knocked out 4-4 on aggregate by Al Ain. Denizli said he was going to leave Pas and headback for Turkey, although he had an option to sign a contract in Dubai. It was said that Mustafa Denizli would take over the Iranian national team after Branko Ivankovic failed to make an impression on the world stage, but the Iranian Amir Ghalenoei was chosen over him. In August 2006, Denizli was hired as the manager of the Iranian club, Persepolis F.C., after Arie Haan was fired. He resigned on June 3, 2007 after an unsuccesful season with Persepolis F.C.|Persepolis in which he failed in the Hazfi Cup with an embarrassing 4-1 defeat to Sepahan F.C.|Sepahan and more importantly the IPL in which his immensely talented team only managed a 3rd place finish.

Denizli has recently announced he is very interested in becoming Iran National football team manager, providing he can reach agreements with the IRIFF.[http://www.iranproleague.net/news/Morenews.cfm?News=3573]
