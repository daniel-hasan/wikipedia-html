Salinas is the county seat and largest municipality of Monterey County in the U.S. state of California. The most current estimate from the California Department of Finance, places the 2006 population at 148,350,;; showing a slight decrease since 2000 which is largely attributed to the city's high cost of living. The largely suburban city is located at the mouth of the Salinas Valley roughly eight miles from the Pacific Ocean and enjoys a mild climate. Salinas is known for being an agricultural center as well as being the hometown of famed writer and Nobel prize laureate John Steinbeck.

History
Salinas began around 1840 as the Halfway House, a stagecoach stop between Monterey and San Juan Bautista.In 1864, a post office was established, Salinas City was laid out, and the city was incorporated ten years later.The city was named after the Salinas River.

Salinas' economy is largely based upon agriculture. Located in one of California's richest farming regions, the area produces a variety of fruits and vegetables, including lettuce, strawberries, watermelons, broccoli, carrots, cabbages, and spinach.Therefore many major vegetable producers are headquartered in Salinas.The historic prevalence of row crop is documented by aerial photographic interpretation of Earth Metrics,;Earth Metrics Inc., ''Aerial photographic interpretation for Salinas, California'' and ''Environmental Assessment for Canada Mobile Estates, Salinas, California'', January 1990; which study also indicated a major conversion of cropland to urban uses over the time period 1956 to 1968,;U.S.G.S. Map May 14,1956 ABG-6R-5, #75 1:20,000;;U.S.G.S. Map June 13,1968 GS-VBZK-2-224, #214 1:30,000; with that trend continuing for the next decades as well. 

Salinas was also the birthplace of writer and Nobel Prize laureate John Steinbeck. The recently revitalized historic downtown, featuring much fine Victorian architecture, is home to the National Steinbeck Center by Kasavan Architects, Executive Architect, the Steinbeck House (open weekdays) and the John Steinbeck Library. The city is currently meeting with a group of local businesspeople who have received preliminary approval for a plan to build a mixed-use development on the site of the old Cominos Hotel which was torn down in the early 1990s due to earthquake damage. The plan calls for a high-rise hotel, conference facilities, retail and condominiums.Plans to restore the old Chinatown (featured in John Steinbeck's novel East of Eden), just north of downtown, began in March 2007 with a vision of mixed uses emphasizing walkable neighborhoods, affordable and workforce housing, social services, retail and public green spaces.

Geography
Sunset at Salinas River State Beach.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 19.0&amp;nbsp;square miles (49.2&amp;nbsp;km²), all of it land.

The city lies approximately 18 meters (59 feet) above sea level and is located roughly eight miles from the Pacific Ocean coast, at the mouth of the Salinas Valley.The Gabilan and Santa Lucia mountain ranges border the Salinas Valley to the east and west, respectively.Both mountain ranges and the Salinas Valley run approximatelysouth-east from Salinas towards King City.

Conveyor belt weather
On 10 March 2006, a record breaking storm covered many of the nearby mountain tops in a white blanket of snow.
Salinas enjoys cool and moderate temperatures due to the &quot;natural air conditioner&quot; that conveys ocean air and fog in from the Monterey Bay to Salinas while towns to the north and south of Salinas experience hotter summers as mountains block the ocean air.Thus Salinas weather is closer to that of the Central Coast of California rather than that of inland valleys and thus enjoys a mild Mediterranean climate with typical daily highs ranging from the low 50s (°F) in the winter to the low 70s (°F) in the summer.The difference between ocean and air temperature also tends to create heavy morning fog during the summer months (known as the marine layer) driven by an onshore wind created by the local high pressure sunny portions of the Salinas Valley which extend north and south from Salinas and the Bay.

The average annual rainfall for the city is approximately 14.4 in). Occasionally there is snowfall on the peaks of the Gabilan and Santa Lucia mountain ranges, but snow in the city itself is extremely rare, occurring about once every 10-20 years on average.

Airport
Salinas Municipal Airport is located on the southeastern boundary of the City of Salinas, three miles from city center. It is a general aviation facility occupying , with three runways serving single and twin engine aircraft and helicopters, as well as an increasing number of turbopropeller and turbine-powered business jets.
The airport has an air traffic control tower in operation twelve hours/day, 7 days/week. The Airport Terminal is located on Mortensen Avenue and houses Airport Office staff as well as professional offices. The City is currently accepting proposals for leasing and operation of the restaurant located within the Terminal. Salinas Airport Commissioners gave the nod to a proposed project that would bring a 100-room hotel, offices and hangars to a vacant lot in front of the Salinas Municipal Airport terminal. The Salinas Jet Center would include a national chain hotel,of office space, four large complexes combining more offices with airplane hangars and a 24-hour, full-service plane-fueling station.The project would also include a taxiway to allow planes to come and go from the new hangars.

The airport has full Instrument Landing System (ILS) and VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) located on the airport. The ILS has a Medium Intensity Approach Lighting System, with Runway Alignment Indicator Lights. The VOR approach has Runway End Identifier Lights. All but the ILS runway, RWY 31, have Visual Approach Slope Indicators (VASIs).

Economy

Salinas is known as the ''Salad Bowl of America'' or ''Salad Bowl of the World''. Over 80% of the lettuce grown in the United States is grown in the Salinas Valley. The city's labor force is almost evenly divided between blue collar, 54.6%, and white collar, 45.4%. According to the 2000 US Census, 24% of the population worked in sales and office occupations, 21.4% worked in management, professional, and related occupations, 16.2% worked in service occupations, 14.9% worked in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, 14.4% worked in production, transportation, and material moving occupations, and 9.1% worked in construction, extraction, and maintenance occupations.

Housing prices
While the median household income in Salinas remains near the national median at $50,165
,;; the median home price in the city has risen to $560,600;;. The large discrepancy between household income levels and the median home price is largely due to a surge in house prices in the coastal California. Between 2004 and 2005, home prices within the city rose by 23.3%.;; The city has seen double digit growth in its median home prices each consecutive year between 2000 and 2005. During the 2000 US Census, the median asking price for a home was $229,000.;;. Since then home prices have risen by $326,000 (142%) to being over a half-million dollars. Household income, however, only rose a relatively modest 16.27%.;; Today Salinas has a far higher median home price than considerably more affluent communities such Bellevue, Washington with a median home price of $405,000 and a median household income of $88,432.;; As of 2006, the city's median household income remains 8.6% above the national median of $46,000, while the median home price has risen to 232.68% above the national median of $167,500.;;

City funding
Ranch style home in North Salinas
During the first half of this decade, the Salinas city government struggled to deal with funding shortages.A downturn in the state economy, combined with an unusually low per-capita tax base, forced the city to curtail certain services. During the crisis, Salinas almost became the first city in the United States to close its libraries. However, an outpouring of private donations provided an ample stop-gap measure, keeping the libraries open with reduced hours. Donations were raised through Rally Salinas!, a grassroots fundraising organization launched by the city's mayor, to keep the libraries open through 2005. 

In November 2005, voters approved a tax measure to fund several vital services in the city, including libraries, by a 61 percent vote. The measure, known locally asMeasure V, will provide some $11 million in funding to take effect in the 2007 fiscal year. The measure will allow the city to start restoring more than $15 million in service cuts including the closure of three recreation centers and the elimination of graffiti abatement and crossing guard money for schools. An independent oversight committee was appointed by the City Council to oversee the money raised by the tax increase, which will be in place for the next 10 years. In April 2006, the committee recommended dedicating 70% of revenues to restoring library and police services.

In 2006, the city's financial situation was considerably improved, as Salinas officials announced a budget surplus.In July 2007, library restoration had progressed enough to increase open hours to 117 (across the three branches), which was the number before the budget cuts but only 68% of the system's peak of 171.In late July, the city announced the hiring of a new library director who declared a long-term goal of opening the system 7 days a week.Various community groups, including Friends of the Salinas Public Library and the Salinas Library Commission, are championing the effort for reinvention of the library system to improve and expand services.

Crime
The homicide rate since 1985 for Salinas, Sacramento and the US total.
One of the city's most serious problems is violent crime-gangs. While the city's current violent crime rate is above the national average, historic trends suggest improvement. The number of aggravated assaults fell from 844 in 1993 to 661 in 1998. In 2004, there were 11.4 murders per 100,000 residents, more than twice the national average of 5.5. In 2005, however, the city's homicide rate decreased dramatically to a record low of 4.96 homicides per 100,000 persons, approximately 15% below national average where it remained for 2006.;; Overall the rate of homicides per 100,000 persons has remained largely stagnant since the mid 1980s, having returned from its record high levels in mid and late 1990s.;;;;

=Gangs=
Gang activity is responsible for a substantial portion of the violent crime in Salinas. The majority of street gang territory in Salinas comes under the Norteño and Sureño gangs. 
In 1998, local police estimated that 17% of all violent crimes -- and 71% of the city's homicides -- were gang related. Partners for Peace, a local gang prevention and youth welfare group, cites the low educational attainment, low household income (considering the median house price), and high population density caused by a lack of affordable housing as aggravating factors. The County of Monterey launched a task force early this year in an effort to fight the problem of gangs. The Monterey County Joint Gang Task Force is composed of personnel from the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, Probation Department, District Attorney's Office and the Salinas Police Department.The Sheriff's Office and the Salinas Police Department have ordered seven cars that will allow task force members to use their own equipment. The cars will feature radio and computer systems that can communicate across both Sheriff's Office and police frequencies. To increase their visibility to gang members, the cars are painted black with the words &quot;Gang Task Force&quot; written in silver across the sides, making them distinct from the black-and-white cars used by regular patrol officers.The mayor of Salinas announced (March 2007) the appointment of a Community Safety Director, a new position created to coordinate multiple government agencies and nonprofit organizations involved with crime prevention and suppression.

At the present time, the only gang prevention, intervention and counseling program that is working directly with at-risk youth is [http://www.scyp.org/aboutus.htm Second Chance Family &amp; Youth Services] located at 745 N. Sanborn Road, Salinas CA 93905.Brian K. Contreras founded the agency in 1980 and is a recipient of the California Wellness Foundation of the 2001 California Peace Prize.Second Chance provides a number of programs and services to residents throughout the County of Monterey and the city of Salinas including youth counseling, group counseling, tattoo removal (gang or drug related), community presentations, training for parents, teachers, educators, administrators, law enforcement and social service providers, neighborhood clean-up and graffiti removal are among a few.

Schools
Salinas has seven school districts serving the city core and adjacent unincorporated areas. The largest school district in Salinas is the Salinas Union High School District (grades 7-12) with 13,578 students enrolled in 10 campuses.[http://www.greatschools.net/cgi-bin/ca/district_profile/398/] The Salinas City Elementary School District is the largest elementary school district in Salinas. Salinas City Elementary has 12 schools and 7,954 students. [http://www.greatschools.net/cgi-bin/ca/district_profile/393/]. 

=School closures / openings=
In April 2005, in a last ditch effort to keep the district solvent, the [http://schools.monterey.k12.ca.us/~salcity Salinas City Elementary School District] voted to close two elementary schools, Boronda School and Lincoln School. Closing Roosevelt School (K-6) was considered but the school was saved by its historical ties to John Steinbeck, who attended it as a child.

The newest school in Salinas is [http://www.borondameadowselementary.com Boronda Meadows Elementary], built in 2005. Boronda Meadows was to have been a magnet school. This magnet school was to be divided into two campuses, one for technology and the other for fine arts. With the closing of Boronda and Lincoln schools, the magnet school idea was dropped in favor of a traditional school setting. Boronda Meadows is, however, perhaps the most technologically advanced elementary school in Salinas. Some of the advances include wi-fi access available campus wide, integrated digital projectors in each room, a television studio, mobile computer accounts for students, VOIP, and mobile computer labs. As a reminder of the two campus idea, Boronda Meadows currently has twogyms, two outdoor amphitheaters, two indoor stages, two cafeterias, two separate bussing lanes and two playgrounds.
