Danny Phantom, the heroic ghostly alter-ego of Daniel &quot;''Danny''&quot; Fenton &amp;ndash; is a superhero, the protagonist and titular character of the Nickelodeon animated television series ''Danny Phantom''. Because of his family's and the whole town's hatred of ghosts, Danny has told nobody except his friends Tucker Foley and Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Manson|Sam Manson about his powers (though it is possible he wouldn't have told Sam or Tucker about his powers had they not been there when he received them), and struggles to hide his ghost identity from his family: his parents Jack and Madeline &quot;''Maddie''&quot; Fenton and his sister Jasmine &quot;''Jazz''&quot; Fenton, although she eventually realized Danny as the heroic half-ghost in the episode,;; and has since covered for him (she eventually confessed her secret to Danny in &quot;''The Ultimate Enemy''&quot;). 

Mostly all of his enemies have also figured out his secret identity and have tried to exploit it as Technus did in &quot;''Flirting with Disaster''&quot;. His one goal is to be an astronaut when he grows up.;&quot;''Actually, dad, I wanna be an astronaut.&quot;'', Mystery Meat; He is voiced by David Kaufman.

History
Living with his ghost-obsessed parents since his birth, Danny had to put up with their unique personalities that often traumatized him as well as constantly be forced to listen to their parents ramble or instruct their children on how their numerous Fenton gadgets worked. However, this did nothing to stop Danny's curiosity that one day changed his life forever. While in his parents' laboratory, Danny had an accident involving the newly built &quot;''Fenton Portal''&quot;, causing his entire DNA#genetic structure|molecular structure to be infused with ectoplasm.

As a result Danny Fenton becomes a half-human, half-ghost hybrid; he styles himself as a new person as Danny Phantom, an extraordinary spectral superhero with a ghostly array of other-worldly powers; able to shift between the forms his human-half and his ghost-half at will, coming into a number of various supernatural/paranormal/metaphysical/extraordinary abilities. Upon transformation, his normally black hair turns white, his eyes change from sky blue to ectoplasmic green, his skin changes from light to tanned, and his normal attire becomes a black hazmat suit - with white boots, gloves, belt, and starting from the second season, a &quot;''D''&quot; emblem with an inner &quot;''P''&quot; on his chest, becoming ''&quot;Danny Phantom&quot;''. The emblem is added by Danny's friend Sam Manson during an alternate timeline where she is forced to live in a world where she never met Danny. ;;

=Beginning Struggles=
Having possessed his powers for a full month, Danny struggles with the decision to either expose its content to his family while maintaining a normal life despite his then current anxiety. After a battle with the ghost of the evil Lunch Lady, Danny begins understanding why he was given these powers and ultimately decides not to tell his family, thus starting his long road of becoming a superhero to the people of Amity Park. ;; As his power and confidence progressed, Danny would eventually meet his less then better half, Vlad Masters, who would serve as his primary arch-nemesis throughout the series, possessing the same half-ghost powers he does, only 20 years more experienced. ;; 

For the majority of the earlier episodes, Danny Phantom wasn't particularly a well known ghost. However, his major comeuppance in the Amity Park's public eyes came in when Walker, a ghost cop, in a fit of revenge against Danny who escaped his thousand year imprisonment (as well as having unleashed various other prisoners);; ambushed the entire city, eventually possessing the mayor and making Danny Phantom look as though he were holding him hostage, framing him and causing the public to shun the ghost boy. He would, however befriend the renegade Wulf, a runaway from Walker's prison. ;; 
Since then, Danny has been consistently hunted down by Amity Park's local authority whom dubbed him ''&quot;Inviso-Bill&quot;'', despite his intentions to still bring about good to the world with only his two friends and Jazz supporting him (the latter in secret), as well as Paulina who fell in love with Danny's alter ego ghost half in ;;.

=A Hero=
He eventually gained the trust and praise of the majority of Amity Park after he valiantly fought rogue ghost king Pariah Dark, locking him back in his coffin. Since then, his existence and popularity has soared, many respecting and looking up for him (By &quot;''Urban Jungle&quot;'', he has stated he is the city's officially deputized protector, and his status is comparable to a rock star's in ''&quot;Forever Phantom&quot;'') with few exceptions (such as Valerie whom still held a grudge against him). ;; This act of courage is acknowledged in the Ghost Zone, enough that Frostbite (later his mentor to tutor Danny on handling ice powers) and his people honor him as &quot;''The Great One''&quot; and &quot;''Savior of the Ghost Zone''&quot;. ;;

=Alternate Challenges=
Danny struggles with his greatest challenge when he bears witness to an alternate future where his cheating on the CAT (Career Aptitude Test) causes the death of his family, friends, and Lancer through a Nasty Burger explosion. Orphaned, Danny moves in with Vlad, the only one who can understand his situation. With great sympathies for the boy, Vlad honored his wishes and removed his ghost half from his human self. Danny's ghost half went rogue and split Vlad's human half and merged with Vlad's ghost self, resulting in the birth of Dark Danny. After presumably killing his human self and blowing up Vlad's manor, he went on a ten-year world destruction tour. Danny does battle with his future self eventually and with the help of Clockwork, alters his future so that he can have a second chance to undo the damage that would have reached full circle if left unaltered.;;

An encounter with Freakshow and his Reality Gauntlet resulted in him accidentally revealing his secret to the general public, causing wide storm news all over America and in mad pursuit by the Guys in White for experimental purposes. While avoiding them, Danny and his friends managed to gather the Reality Gems as trade-in for their parent's safety, kidnapped by Freakshow and used as blackmail. Danny ultimately tricks and defeats Freakshow, taking his Reality Gauntlet afterwards and returning everything back to the way it was prior to the main events of this episode with only his friends and sister's memory spared.;;

=New Allies/Old Friends=
Danny's life grew even more bizarre when he meets his &quot;''third cousin once removed,''&quot; Danielle a.k.a. Dani Phantom, curiously a half ghost like himself. He later finds out she is one of the many imperfect clones that Vlad has made as a gateway to his &quot;''perfect half-ghost son''&quot;.He has sent Danielle to fetch Danny to capture his mid-morph sample for the final processing. Danny managed to convince Danielle that Vlad was only using her. Unable to accept the harsh truth, she realizes it when Vlad declares she is only meant to serve him, causing her to team up with Danny and destroy his clone lab, including his perfect clone. With Vlad defeated, Dani flies off, vowing to meet again. ;; Danielle would eventually returned to Amity Park, seeking Danny's help to stabilizing her. Managing to convince a reluctant Valerie, she and Danny charge into Vlad's manor where Dani was currently being destabilized by Plasmius. He uses Jack's latest invention: Ecto-Dejecto (originally meant to decrease ghost powers, only for it to have the opposite affect on them) on her, restoring her solid form. After defeating Vlad, she ventures off for parts unknown.;;

Danny reunites with Wulf after the Casper High students summer camp trip ends faulty when said children were kidnapped by beasts sent by Walker and his cops--at first to capture Wulf who coincidentally were in the same forest as the campers--and eventually to gain Danny's attention. With Sam, Danny and Wulf managed to save Tucker and his classmates, then declared to Wulf they are forever &quot;''Amigos&quot;'' before he runs--free once more.;;

=A Bright Future=
After Vlad ran for mayor in Danny's hometown of Amity Park, Danny had to frequently deal with him as well as new and old ghosts. The series finale gave him his ultimate task when upon meeting up with Vlad's Masters Blasters, Danny questioned his superhero business. Zapping himself in the Ghost Portal, he regained his humanity with his only shred of evidence as half ghost being a white streak on his hair. At the same time, a much bigger crisis--namely that of an ecto-coated asteroid aims for Earth, timed to collide in a week, destroying the entire planet.

With renewed determination, Danny regained his powers through multiple blasts from ghosts, affecting his white streak which further expands throughout his body, reclaiming his half ghost status. Gaining every human being on Earth's attention, he announces a plan to phase the entire planet intangible - so the asteroid can pass through harmlessly. Gaining help from a &quot;''bazillion''&quot; ghosts after much convincing, humans and ghosts work side by side as they successfully save the world from disaster. With his secret identity revealed to the world, Danny is hailed as a hero all over Earth.;;

Personality/Weakness
Having become a half-human, half-ghost teenage superhero with ghost powers, has significantly altered Danny's life, though he is still susceptible to basic flaws of character. Danny Fenton is a nervous, clumsy, and sometimes superficial 14-year-old boy who tries to fit in with his peers; even with him being as unique as he is; revealed in ''Frightmare'', Danny dreams of the social acceptance of his superhuman status.

Danny has every reason to feel as paranoid as he does about keeping his ghost half a secret whenever possible (however, his paranoia has yet to do a thing about his boundless curiosity, which was the main reason why he got his ghost-powers to begin with), lacking much confidence at the beginning as well possessing frequent displays of shyness and naive nature. 

When his friends and family are in danger, Danny can become rather stubborn and overprotective and is often prone to see a more straight-forward black and white side of things then the deeper middles. He is also often too emotional which can be used as a disadvantage;; or put to great use.;;

Over the course of the series, Danny has seen developed a more confident, mature attitude over the course of the show as he continues to develop his powers; but it is ultimately his loyalty to his cause, along with his faith in the love of those close to him, and the love he gives back to others that helps him to overcome all obstacles. Even when he is vilified by the public early in his career, his sense of civic duty is so strong that he felt that retiring was out of question; only when a rival ghostbuster team was both outclassing him and threatening his friends and family, did he decide to remove his powers, though at that point, he felt incredibly &quot;''human&quot;'' and eventually gained it back. 

Danny's maturity can also be argued through the use of his battle-cry of &quot;''I'm goin' ghost!''&quot;. Throughout the series, he seems to use said battle-cry less and less; being used frequently through the first season, a bit less during the second season, and almost never in season three. This is either because of maturity or because he gets sick of saying it so often (&quot;''I'm goin'--oh...well..you know!''&quot; --&quot;''Boxed Up Fury''&quot;). Though it could be because, according to David Kaufman--Danny's voice actor--in an interview, the battle cry is difficult to say over and over again.

Another example of how his powers are &quot;affected&quot; by his maturity is how he doesn't perform any dramatic transformations from Fenton to Phantom in season 3--minus the transformation that revealed his secret to the whole world, but that was from Phantom to Fenton (&quot;''Phantom Planet''&quot;).

It is shown that although he is half-ghost, Danny is still effected by ecto-weapons as his primary weakness.He has also more than once overestimated his abilities or at times is often too naïve or cocky which usually results in a disadvantage during battle. When Danny becomes depressed, disheartened, distracted, low on energy, depowered, unfocused or unprepared, then his confidence, his self-esteem as well as his performance as a ghost hunter affects his ghost powers.

Trivia: At first, Butch Hartman wanted Danny to ride a motorcycle, like the superhero Ghost Rider. But once Danny had the power to fly, the bike didn't make sense anymore.

Romance
Throughout the series, Danny has a long standing crush on Paulina, the most popular girl at school.He was successful in asking her to the dance in as her secret agenda to get Sam jealous.;; and dated her at one point in ;; only to find out she was overshadowed by Johnny 13's girlfriend, Kitty. Ironically, Paulina has fallen in love with his ghostly alter ego. As the series progresses though, with his growing feelings for Sam and his brief romance with Valerie, he has slowly been losing interest in Paulina, even to the point where he doesn't seem to react too much to Paulina's reaction to his secret in &quot;''Reality Trip''&quot;, and why he wiped Paulina's memory of the whole episode--even though Paulina had &quot;''gotten used to the idea of being Paulina Fenton''&quot;. This could arguably because Paulina only liked him for his powers and he wants a girl to like him for more than that.

He also developed a close relationship with another girl named Valerie Gray despite the fact that she's often trying to kill Danny Phantom with her various anti-ghost weaponry. The two found common grounds overlooking a long standing attitude towards one another beforehand and dated briefly in before she broke up with him due to her current life as a ghost hunter.Heartbroken, Danny still continues to harbor romantic feelings for Valerie as of &quot;''Double Cross My Heart''&quot;.

There have been a few hints, particularly in the second and third season, that Danny has romantic feelings for Sam, one of his best friends.However, it has become pretty obvious to mostly everyone else, except Danny, that Sam has a crush on him as well (though she herself has never been straightforward with the issue). Danny has been dubbed &quot;''clueless''&quot;, so his feelings for Sam have not yet been verified, though he has shown small hints throughout. His feelings for her come to terms with he is faced with Sam's new crush, Gregor (Elliot).;; Throughout the majority of Season 3, Danny and Sam's growing romance has been further hinted, the former showcasing he may not be as clueless as he once was and leaning more towards her as potential feelings increasingly develop (even possessing the same dream as Sam does, which includes both of them as a couple--&quot;''Frightmare''&quot;).

By the series finale, Sam gives Danny the &quot;Wes&quot; class ring prior to his then final mission, informing him that she now knows that it was meant for her. Making him promise to come back from his dangerous mission in the Ghost Zone, the two kiss. After saving the world, Danny skips his own reward ceremony to spend alone time with Sam, putting the ring on her finger and kissing her once more. Unsure of what is in store for him, he tells Sam he wants her to share it with him, and flies off with her to see what the future holds for both.

Relationships
=Sam Manson=
A friend of his since at least the 2nd grade, Danny's friendship with Sam isn't always as strong as Tucker due to some of their difference (and her bossy nature), but he values her just as much as Tucker. She undeniably has a crush on Danny, but so far she has hidden it from him well. Danny also shows a certain bond to her which grows in time, but his ghost-fighting career gives him little time to ponder over it. In the series finale, Danny gives Sam the infamous 'Wes' ring when she makes a note of it to him, and the two get some rather vague closure on their 'relationship'.

=Tucker Foley=
Tucker serves as Danny's primary best friend as the two often share many things in common as well as share in general. The only thing Danny and Tucker don't share is Danny's ghost powers (no one does, but Vlad Masters and Danny's clone Danielle Masters/Phantom).Danny often takes Tucker's side whenever his other friend, Sam, tends to berate him.He rarely ever argues with Tucker unless it's usually on an opposing force.

=Jazz Fenton=
At first, Danny was at odds with his sister, often exhibiting hostility due to her more intelligent and slight snobbish nature, despite her concern and protection over her little brother.Prior to the series, in ''My Brother's Keeper'' when Danny was still 8-years-old, brother and sister had talked all the time--before Jazz became, as Danny once stated, &quot;''a fink''&quot; (and a &quot;''conceited snob''&quot;). As the show progresses however, Jazz eventually mellowed down as well as accepted Danny as a half-ghost, often covering up for him.The two have since formed a much tighter bond.

=Jack and Maddie Fenton=
Like Jazz before, Danny sometimes feel at odds with his folks.Danny at an earlier age once connected greatly with his mother.While it seems he doesn't always feel safe with his parents (especially with their desire to hunt ghosts, including Danny Phantom), he still shows love and concern for them as much as they do in return. In ''&quot;Phantom Planet''&quot; his parents finally learn he is Danny Phantom, easily accepting him.

=Valerie Gray=
Danny's opinion of Valerie was anything but kind in the earlier episodes, as he was often not a fan of her egotistical and angry disposition (&quot;''Shades of Grey, Life Lessons''&quot;); however, he later learned to appreciate her for who she is (&quot;''Reign Storm''&quot;).Valerie in turn learned to see Danny's personality past his awkward status in school (seeing as she now had to experience the same thing) and by the episode's end, started to like him in a romantic manner.The two dated briefly in &quot;''Flirting with Disaster''&quot; before she broke up with him over her current job as a ghost hunter (unaware Danny faced the same dilemma, too).It seems as though Danny still harbors subtle feelings for her. Unlike Paulina, who likes Danny's ghost side and ignores his human side, Valerie hated Danny's ghost side and liked his human side. In &quot;''Phantom Planet''&quot;, when she finds out he is half ghost, we only see her in shock at first and then smiling and cheering for him.

=Vlad Plasmius=
Vlad is Danny's primary antagonist and arch-rival.Danny's often at odds with the other half ghost as he often has to resist his offers to join his side and be his son (although by the time of &quot;''Eye for an Eye''&quot;, Vlad seems to view him purely as a rival now).Danny takes it upon himself to constantly insult and defeat him every chance he gets, though when the situation arises, the two are often forced to work reluctantly side to side.Only in the alternative future set in ''&quot;The Ultimate Enemy&quot;'' seems to show Danny relying on Vlad in a less antagonistic light. By ''Phantom Planet'' Vlad and Danny are forever on bad terms with no chance of Vlad ever returning to Earth.

=Danielle &quot;''Dani''&quot; Phantom=
Danny's clone is much like him, making her easy to talk with, yet still hard to handle due to a more stubborn nature than Danny himself.The two were on opposing teams until Dani realized her creator, Vlad, was only using her, so she joined Danny's group; though she is more affiliated to Danny than the group itself.Out of the two, Danny is more responsible, thus he keeps an eye for Dani, or at least what she might do.She has since left for the time, her current whereabouts are unknown and her reasons for leaving are unknown; but before leaving, she lets Danny know she vows to return. She reappears in &quot;''D-Stabilized''&quot;, searching for Danny to find a cure for her dissolving ailment. Danny managed to find her a cure, maintaining her status and giving her a solid form.

=Dark Danny=
Danny's Ultimate Enemy is his most hated and feared foe ever.Although Danny is at odds with his other enemies, including Vlad, Dark Danny is a whole other story.Dark Danny is, or at least ''was'', Danny's future.The only reason Danny was spared is because Dark Danny needed him to live to exist; but now that the timeline has shifted thanks to time travel, Dark Danny will more likely destroy Danny without any hesitation and still be able to exist.

=Skulker=
He is one of the many ghost enemies Danny has to fight--but has proven to be by far his most persistent foe. During the course of the series Skulker has tried to kill Danny and turn him into some sort of a trophy, beforehand declaring only to ''&quot;plan on simply capturing you and letting you live the rest of your life in a cage&quot;'' before ultimately vowing to &quot;''rest your pelt at the foot of my bed!&quot;'' Despite their animosity,Skulker is usually the first ghost Danny asks for help from whenever a much bigger threat comes up, an alliance the ghost hunter is usually reluctant, but ultimately accepting towards--if not due to the serious consequences that could occur if he declined.

Danny's Known Ghostly Powers
As Danny Phantom, he freely uses a variety of supernatural powers. In either form, Danny (as well as all other humans) can see, hear, and speak to other paranormal beings, as well as battle them. Danny possesses most of his supernatural powers in both his dual forms--although he only uses them most freely in his ghost form.The only exception is that Danny cannot utilize his supernatural strength in his human form so far. Other ghosts can sometimes overpower him and impose invisibility and intangibility (or lack thereof) until Danny can regain energy and fight back. To save his friends and family, Danny frequently battles with various ghosts, sometimes from thwarting plans of world domination or confronting them in situations of public disturbances--though when he first started fighting ghosts, the only motivation was that his friends were in danger and that it seemed like the right thing to do since he had the powers. 

Danny has gradually increased in power and abilities as his knowledge and power increases.He now has both completely new abilities as well as increased the power of his original ones.

=Transformation=
*Allows Danny to switch between human and ghost forms. His transformation is prefaced by two blue-white rings that appear respectively around his waist and move in opposite directions of each other while transitioning Danny to his ghost form, though he has used other variations. These variations include the transformation rings going down his arms or legs as smaller rings that are formed from the usual ones, the rings appear vertically along his body as one moves left and the other moves right, among other ones, including one where the energy formed at his head and moved to his feet as he jumped head-first off a truck in &quot;''Control Freaks''&quot;. Danny doesn't make the transformations as dramatic in the third season as he does in the first and second ones.
*He usually accompanies this with his transformation words, &quot;I'm goin' ghost!&quot; or simply &quot;Goin' ghost!&quot;. 
*If Danny falls unconscious, gets heavily disoriented, or uses too much energy while in ghost form, he usually reverts back to human form. It was hinted a bit in &quot;''Shades of Gray''&quot; that real-world items are unable to hurt ghosts unless they are weapons specifically made to hurt ghosts--Danny was surprised to be hurt by one of Valerie's weapons. It was also hinted in &quot;''Million Dollar Ghost''&quot; that a powerful enough ghost is able to stop a half-ghost's transformation, though only somewhat--Vlad was able to stop Danny from changing into his human form after being electrocuted--however, this might just be because Danny was trying to stay in ghost form and when Vlad stopped his attack, he was able to successfully hold it. 'Super' Danny in &quot;''Identity Crisis''&quot; was able to call upon the rings and make them move along him, but they didn't do anything to him since he was full-ghost. 
*Apparently, his ghost form is not affected by the intense cold and vacuum of space, since he flew out into orbit with nothing but a rocket pack and a space helmet in &quot;''Flirting with Disaster''&quot;.

=Ghost Sense=
*Danny can sense nearby ghosts, alerted through a wisp of blue mist coming out of his mouth that indicates a ghost is nearby. In &quot;''My Brother's Keeper''&quot;, Danny apparently associates his Ghost Sense with the sensation of being cold, and Spectra's true identity as a ghost is hidden from him by keeping her office so freezing Danny can continually see his breath. Danny's ghost sense can't seem to detect the presence of half-ghosts, namely Vlad and Danielle. This ability later passed to Dark Danny, but came out as red mist through his nose. This version can also detect half-ghosts, unlike it's predecessor. It is unknown if Vlad has this power as well. 
*It's later revealed that Danny's Ghost Sense has actually been releasing a small amount of his pent-up cryokinetic energy in the form of a wisp of blue mist.It is in &quot;''Urban Jungle''&quot; when it was revealed that his ghost sense was part of his freezing ability that Frostbite taught him to control.

=Wiktionary:intangibility|Intangibility=
*Danny has the ability to turn intangible at will (said to be tingly in feel). With the use of this power, Danny can pass through most objects, becoming untouchable; Danny can also make other people and objects intangible provided he is in physical contact with them. Danny's intangibility is in part connected to his teenage emotions, as he has been known to go intangible at some very inopportune and unwanted times. 
*It is quite common for Danny to make only a part of his body intangible and has been shown that people can see him somewhat when he is intangible. 
*Danny has also been shown to apparently control the flow of his intangibility as he did in where he put his hand on the ground and a water-like flow moved along and phased Tucker through the floor.;; In an opposite case, in the Ghost Zone, humans can phase through everything, including ghosts. However, this was only shown to happen at Walker's Jail. In addition some ghosts are seen as being able to phase through some objects in the Ghost Zone- as long as they have turned intangible.
*This power can work in conjunction with other ghosts as well, as shown in the final episode, when Danny and all the ghosts of the Ghost Zone used their power to make the entire Earth intangible to save it from destruction. 
*Whether ghosts are able to touch intangible ghosts is not constant through the series, usually Danny is able to phase through anything. In the early episodes of Season 1, whenever Danny went intangible in human form, his eyes would glow green and sometimes his suit would change to his ghost form--though this might be just an animation goof. He also automatically went ghost sometimes after reverting to a tangible state, though only if he wanted to be.

=Invisibility=
*When invisible, Danny cannot be seen by human eyes nor scanning devices. Invisibility and Intangibility both work in similar ways, as they are both triggered by Danny's emotional states and thus work well together. It is quite common for Danny to make only a part of his body invisible as well. Danny can also make other people and objects invisible--provided that he is in physical contact with them. 

=Flying/Floating/Hovering=
*While in ghost form, Danny has the ability to float/fly through the air, sometimes at considerable speeds and heights. He often uses this in combat, but sometimes will do it for fun and relaxation. He can also make other humans and objects hover but must keep in physical contact with them. When floating or flying, Danny's bottom half will sometimes turn into a &quot;spectral tail&quot; that is a part of his spectral manipulation power below. 
*Danny's speed of flight was clocked at 112 mph in &quot;''Maternal Instincts''&quot;, though that was in middle of the first season, so by season three he could be much faster. 
*Danny is shown a few times in the first season as being able to fly in human form, but only if he is intangible--however, Vlad was able to fly while solid in &quot;''Phantom Planet''&quot;.

=Paranormal Strength, Speed, Agility and Durability=
*As Danny Phantom, Danny can display extraordinary physical feats of strength, speed, agility, and durability; Danny has developed a high pain threshold given the number of times he has been attacked, shot at, etc., managing to bear the pain. He is able to withstand and recover from numerous, recurring injuries and damage. 
*So far, only when Danny is in ghost form can he perform such feats, while in human form, Danny Fenton is still somewhat physically weak, although, he's been known to survive the impacts from heights while in human form, and from hits that would have possibly killed a normal human being.

=Spectral Manipulation/Ecto-Physical Mass Manipulation/Phase Shifting=
*Spectral manipulation is a ghost's version of List of comic book superpowers#Biological manipulation|Biological manipulation--which includes abilities like List of comic book superpowers#Duplication|Duplication, List of comic book superpowers#Superhuman physical resistance|Superhuman physical resistance etc.--density alteration, like intangibility.It can also be seen as a form of List of comic book superpowers#Shapeshifting|shapeshifting--Danny shifting into his human mode or his ghost mode. Danny has demonstrated the power to change the shape of his body into intangible holes and shapes. 
*His Spectral Manipulation is apparently long-lasting in his belt as seen in ''Shades of Gray'' where a book passed through his waist and ''Pirate Radio'' where Youngblood's sword passed harmlessly through his belt. 
*His &quot;''ghostly tail''&quot; that is seen when flying is arguably a part of this power. Danny, when flying, usually fuses his legs together into a ghost tail--why he does this might be because it is part of his ghost instincts--though he sometimes flies with his legs intact. His ghostly tail might only be appearance, since when Vlad x-rayed a picture of Danny with his ghost tail (&quot;''Kindred Spirits''&quot;), the tail had the normal bones of normal legs--though this might have been an animation goof--and in &quot;''Reality Trip''&quot;, when he flew off-screen with a tail and was grabbed, he was pulled back on screen by the leg. 

=Wall Walking=
*Danny, as well as many other ghosts, can manipulate their center of gravity; they can walk and run on up and down uneven and vertical surfaces as though they were horizontal. This either because of his ability to defy gravity (flying) or because of some unexplored ability to adhere/combine/interact to/with the molecular structure (clinging) of the surface of walls etc.

=Overshadowing/Possession=
*Danny can take possession of a human being or an animal ;; from within by phasing completely into the person's body, allowing him to completely control that person's actions. When overshadowed, the victim keeps his or her original form, but his or her eyes and voice change to Danny's (a flaw Danny eventually masters by (''Eye for An Eye'') when he briefly overshadowed one of Vlad's duplicates). 
*The victim has no memory of what he or she did while overshadowed, but usually feel a slight dizziness and disorientation, and occasionally feel influenced by what Danny says or does (one example being Dash feeling the urge to wash his mother's feet after Danny overshadows him and forces him to say the very same thing to Paulina).
*On numerous occasions, it has been demonstrated that this ability can be resisted, and that Danny can even be forced out of the person with the right equipment, or if he's not up to full power. Overshadowing can also be resisted through sheer willpower, demonstrated first by Jack (''Bitter Reunions''). 
*Ghosts can still use their powers of flight, intangibility, and invisibility while overshadowing someone. Danny has also used this power to enter people's dreams.;;
*Overshadowing has been shown as a power that is separate from intangibility (&quot;''Micro-Management''&quot;, even after losing his intangibility), despite the fact ghosts are shown intangible usually before going into the human.

=Ectoplasmic Energy Blast - &quot;''Ghost Ray''&quot;=
*First seen in &quot;''What You Want&quot;'', an ectoplasmic blast that usually comes out of the palm of his hand, Danny blasts enemies using this attack.The attack takes many forms: a ray of energy, a glowing orb, or even a repulsion field. He has also kept the energy used inside his hand, using it to empower his strikes. By the time of &quot;''Reign Storm''&quot;, Danny had learned how to fire off a Ghost Ray while human. These rays can also be charged to various power levels, from a highly powerful white-green, to a low-level glow for lighting up dark areas. He is also able to charge up a ball of light and throw it to disorient enemies with its brightness (&quot;''Double Cross My Heart''&quot;). He has recently learned to fire circular rays in a manner similar to Vlad's, creating a rudimentary ectoplasmic bomb (&quot;''Boxed Up Fury''&quot;). Ghost rays are also shown as having melting abilities--in &quot;''The Fright Before Christmas''&quot;, Danny melted a piece of paper.
*Danny can also use this power to force ghosts out of people they are overshadowing.
*Note that the color of ecto-blasts is not a constant through the series--Danny is the only (half-)ghost in the series (that has the ability to fire blasts) that only fires one color (green)--even his evil future self continued to fire green rays--while a good deal of other ghosts are shown able to fire various colors (Vlad is shown firing all the colors at least once in the series). 
*The different colors of blasts also seem to show how powerful that ghost is (Vlad seems to favor violet-blasts, though he also fires red ones occasionally--the Ghost King fired red ecto-blasts, which seems to hint that they are the most powerful variety of ecto-blasts). The different colored blasts in order from weakest to strongest through the series seems to be in this order: green/white, blue, violet, then red. This theory can be backed up: in &quot;''Maternal Instincts''&quot;, Vlad fired blue rays when weakened by the Specter Deflector, which shows that he was only weakened one blast-color; Danny was able to fire blue blasts while in the Exo-skeleton (&quot;''Reign Storm''&quot;), which means that at that time, his power increased ten-times over enables him to fire blasts one-color/power higher; Skulker seems to always fire blue blasts from his battle-suit, which are fairly powerful; Ember was shown using violet energy in &quot;''Fanning the Flames''&quot; when everyone was chanting her name; and there are various other examples.
*The term &quot;''Ghost Rays''&quot; is not used throughout the series that much. Most ghosts (including Vlad) simply refer to them as 'blasts' or possibly &quot;ecto-blasts&quot; (though the latter could be simply fanon, as it is mostly used in fanfics when referring to this ability)--though Danny does mention them as &quot;Ghost Rays&quot; in &quot;''Claw of the Wild''&quot;.

=Ectoplasmic Energy Shield - &quot;''Ghost Shield''&quot;=
*Danny can use this ability to form shields of ectoplasmic energy, which he can use to block or rebound attacks from enemies. There are three kinds of shields; the first is a shield that appears as a sphere of energy that protects from all sides (&quot;''Bitter Reunions''). The second is a single wall of energy--an ectoplasmic energy construct--that is more direct in its range but is much stronger. ;;, and in ''My Brother's Keeper'', Danny is shown to be capable of projecting a green, dome-shaped barrier to protect himself from Bertrand in bug form. Danny can create an Ecto-Orb and use it as a circular shield ;;;; He's also able to create a shield by holding up his forearm, creating a medium ranged, relatively strong shield big enough to protect him from strong head-on attacks.

=Ghost Stinger (&quot;''Public Enemies''&quot; one-time power)=
*Danny uses this pseudo-electric attack to free Wulf from Bullet's weapon, although it could just be Danny's power traveling through Bullet's weapon, like energy feedback through the energy field of the ectoplasmic energy construct.;;

=Ghostly Wail=
*Danny's most powerful technique. Danny develops the unique ability to generate an extremely powerful wail, like a sonic scream, from his vocal cords and mouth, a bit like a Banshee's wail - with a ghostly-like moaning. The Ghostly Wail can cause terrible pain to ghosts and damage tangible matter. This ability was powerful enough to destroy the massive artificially generated Ghost Shield that protected the future Amity Park, and ghost proof restraints used on him in &quot;''The Ultimate Enemy''&quot;. It is also effective against multiple targets . 
*When used, this power quickly drains present-Danny's energy and completely turns him back to human in most cases, a problem he apparently has remedied by &quot;''Phantom Planet''&quot;, though it is possible it ''might'' be because he was in the Ghost Zone, because when he first used it only his head reverted to it's human form, and in &quot;''Phantom Planet''&quot; he was also in the Ghost Zone but didn't revert human. However, this could be because of his increasing power--which is devinantly a possibility. Also, it should be noted that, in &quot;''The Ultimate Enemy''&quot;, he was unable to go ghost after using the Ghostly Wail no matter how long he waited (probably not for a long time), but later on in &quot;''King Tuck''&quot;, he is able to transform a while after changing back. 
*He has used this power only in extreme cases; against a really powerful foe he is unable to defeat by other means (&quot;''The Ultimate Enemy''&quot;, &quot;''King Tuck''&quot; (in this case, the Ghostly Wail actually ''failed'' to defeat the target, which meant Danny reverted to human form), &quot;''Kindred Spirits''&quot;) or to defeat a large group/army of enemies all at once(&quot;''The Ultimate Enemy''&quot;, &quot;''Frightmare Before Christmas''&quot;, &quot;''Phantom Planet''&quot;). Why he didn't use it against Undergrowth (&quot;''Urban Jungle''&quot;), Vortex (&quot;''Torrent of Terror''&quot;), or Nocturne (&quot;''Frightmare''&quot;) is probably because he didn't want to take a chance that these three extremely powerful ghosts could possibly be immune to his Ghostly Wail, and he would be defenceless after trying.
*The way Danny reverts to human form thanks to this ability seems to be different throughout the season, though mainly he simply changes back with his normal transformation, sometimes his body &quot;fades&quot; back into Danny Fenton, or like in &quot;''Frightmare Before Christmas''&quot; when his human form's coat appeared but he managed to stay ghost until he actually stopped the wail, fell to his knees, and changed back with the usual movement of two light blue rings.
*This is also one of two powers that Danny has and Vlad does not (the other being his cryokinesis). This power also seems to be very affective against Vlad.

=Duplication=
*First seen in use by Vlad, Danny has struggled with this power the most, trying to manipulate his body to largely disastrous results. He successfully split in two ;;, if only for a quick second. He successfully split in four by to combat Vortex, though it drained him of his energy briefly.;; 

=Ectoplasmic Energy Constructs=
*Danny has shown that he can utilize ectoplasmic energy constructs. He can shape ectoplasmic energy into solid objects--in &quot;''Double Cross My Heart''&quot;, Danny is able to generate one to use as his most powerful shield to protect himself.

=Teleportation (&quot;''Reality Trip''&quot; one-time power)=
*Danny temporarily disappeared from sight and reappeared in another location a short distance away during the final battle in &quot;''Reality Trip&quot;''. This, though could possibly be a variation of his invisibility powers.

=Weather Manipulation (&quot;''Torrent of Terror''&quot;, but only temporarily)=
*In &quot;''Torrent of Terror''&quot;, Vortex accidentally gave Danny the ability to use weather controlling powers that were heavily tied to Danny's emotions and could counteract Vortex's own abilities (creating thunderstorms, tornadoes, gusts of wind, etc.). Danny, however, loses the power by the end of the episode.
;

=Cryokinesis - &quot;''Ghostly Ice''&quot;=
*Danny is capable of using ice-empowered versions of the Ghost Ray. Revealed to be an extension of his ghost sense and ghost rays rather than a separate power altogether entirely, it is most likely based off of the &quot;''cold spots''&quot; that supposedly accompany ghosts. This power allows Danny to radiate cold, to shoot off rays of intense cold or fire off Danny Phantom (character)#Ectoplasmic Energy Bolts|solid projectiles from both his palms and eyes (when he uses this power his eyes sometimes turn blue instead of their usual ghostly green). 
*This power has been building up inside him as &quot;''negative heat''&quot; ever since he first gained his ghost powers, his body eventually becoming too numb and chilled when the pent-up energy got to be too much for him to ignore, giving him flu-like symptoms. Frostbite successfully managed to teach him how to handle this ability though.;;By the end, he is already capable of using this power comfortably. 
*After &quot;''Urban Jungle''&quot;, Danny uses his ice powers often in his fights, especially against enemies that used to be dominant over him (in his dream during &quot;''Frightmare''&quot;, he was easily able to defeat the Fright Knight by using his ice powers--though the real Fright Knight could possibly be resistant to ice powers or be able to at least dodge, but for the purpose of it being his dream, he won the fight easily). It's also a very useful power against Vlad Masters, because the he doesn't have this power.
*This is one of two powers (the other being the Ghostly Wail) that Danny has that Vlad does not.

=Telekinesis (&quot;''Boxed Up Fury''&quot; one-time power)=
*In &quot;''Boxed Up Fury''&quot;, Danny shot green energy that wasn't like his usual ecto-blasts. This green energy spread around a rake and then lifted it so he could give it to the Box Ghost. Danny shows no surprise in using this, meaning he must have learned this off-screen. This power is never used again. This might be a variation of the spreading ecto-energy he used in &quot;''Maternal Instincts''&quot; to use intangibility to sink Tucker into the ground without having to physically touch Tucker and then in &quot;''Phantom Planet''&quot; with the other ghosts to turn the whole world intangible.
