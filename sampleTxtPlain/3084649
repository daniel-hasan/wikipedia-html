History
In 1863, Robert College was founded in Bebek as the oldest American high school outside the borders of the United States. The school was founded by Christopher Rhinelander Robert, a wealthy American and a philanthropist, and Cyrus Hamlin, a missionary devoted to education. Six years after its foundation, with the permission () of the Ottoman Sultan, the first campus (at present, it is the South Campus of Boğaziçi University) was built in Bebek at the ridge of Rumelihisarı|Rumelia Fortress, very close to a Bektashi tekke, whose leaders maintained an excellent relationship with the Unitarian founders of Robert. The first building of the school was named &quot;Hamlin Hall&quot; in memory of Cyrus Hamlin.

After Hamlin's death, Robert College was successfully administrated by George Washburn (1877-1903) and Caleb Gates (1903-1932). Though founded at the time of the Ottoman Empire as an institution of higher learning serving the Christian minority of the Balkans and the foreigners living in Istanbul, the school adopted a strictly secular educational model in accordance with the republican principles of Turkey in 1923. Robert College, in the past had junior high school, high school, and university sections under the names ''Robert Academy'', ''Robert Yüksek'' and ''American College for Girls''. Since 1971, the school has functioned only as a &quot;high school&quot; (more comparable to the French ''lycée'' in academic rigor) on its Arnavutköy campus (formerly the campus of ''American College for Girls''), yet it retains the title of College. The Bebek campus was donated to the Republic of Turkey for use as the campus ground for what is now a a leading public institution of higher learning, namely Boğaziçi University.
