Charles Duncombe, 1st Baron Feversham (5 December 1764 &amp;ndash; 16 July 1841), was a British Member of Parliament. 

Feversham was elected to the House of Commons for Shaftesbury in 1790, a seat he held until 1796, and then represented Aldborough from 1796 to 1806, Heytesbury from 1812 to 1816 and Newport, Isle of Wight from 1818 to 1826. However, he never held ministerial office. In 1826 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Feversham, of Duncombe Park in the County of York.

Lord Feversham married Lady Charlotte Legge, daughter of William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, in 1795. He died in July 1841, aged 76, and was succeeded in the barony by his son William. Lady Feversham died in 1848.
