''All the Filth!'' is a compilation album from punk rock band the Pork Dukes. Released in 1999, it is notable as the first CD release to feature some of the band's long out-of-print 1970s-era recordings. Alongside the A and B-sides of the first three singles and a selection of tracks from the studio albums ''Pink Pork'' and ''Pig Out of Hell'', the album also features several previously unreleased tracks from the ''Pink Pork'' sessions and unreleased material recorded in the early 1990s. The album was re-issued by Damaged Goods Records in 2007 with four additional tracks from the 2004 Pop Stars EP.;http://www.damagedgoods.co.uk/cgi-bin/miva?dama/merchant.mv+Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=1&amp;Product_Code=DAMGOOD279CD&amp;Category_Code=LR;
