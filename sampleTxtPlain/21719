The New England Patriots, commonly called the &quot;Pats&quot; by sports writers and fans,;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=nwe ESPN.com] An example of the &quot;Pats&quot; nickname being used within sports reports. Accessed 26 January 2006.; are a professional American football team based in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The team is part of the Eastern Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The owners changed the name from the original Boston Patriots after relocating the team to Foxborough in 1971.

An original member of the American Football League (AFL), the Patriots joined the NFL in the AFL-NFL Merger|1970 merger of those leagues. The team advanced to the playoffs four times before appearing in Super Bowl XX in January 1986, losing to the Chicago Bears. The team also appeared in Super Bowl XXXI in 1997, losing to the Green Bay Packers. 

Between 2001 and 2005, the Patriots became the second team in NFL history (after the Dallas Cowboys) to win three Super Bowls in four years (Super Bowl XXXVI, XXXVIII, and XXXIX), and the eighth to win consecutive Super Bowls. As Boston Globe sports columnist Dan Shaughnessy wrote after the Super Bowl XXXIX win: &quot;And the New England Patriots of the 21st century are established as an NFL dynasty on a par with the Packers of the 1960s, the Steelers of the '70s, the 49ers of the '80s, and the Cowboys of the '90s.&quot;;

; In 2007, the Patriots became only the second team in the NFL#The Merger|modern era of the NFL to complete a perfect regular season with a record of 16-0, and the first team to do so since the introduction of the 16 game season.

=1959–1969=
On November 16 1959, Boston business executive Billy Sullivan was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing American Football League (AFL). The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name. The most popular choice—and the one that Sullivan selected—was &quot;Boston Patriots&quot;.Immediately thereafter, Phil Bisell developed the &quot;Pat Patriot&quot; logo (see Logos and Uniforms of the New England Patriots).

Training camp started on July 4, 1960, two months prior to the franchise's first game.;[http://www.patriots.com/history/index.cfm?ac=History Patriots History] Accessed 26 January 2006.; On September 9, 1960, the Boston Patriots played the Denver Broncos in the first-ever AFL regular season game. The Patriots were defeated by a score of 13–10. The Patriots missed the AFL playoffs for their first three seasons. However, in 1963 the Patriots reached the AFL Championship for the first time; they lost to the San Diego Chargers 51–10. The Patriots failed to make it to the AFL playoffs for the rest of the decade. During this period, Patriots running back Jim Nance was named the American Football League's MVP in 1966.;[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/NancJi00.htm/ Jim Nance statistics] Accessed 25 January 2006.;;[http://football.about.com/od/nflhistory/l/bl_awardsmvp.htm NFL MVP player of the year] Accessed 25 January 2006.;

=1970–1975=
The Patriots' second decade began with significant changes. In 1970, the Patriots' franchise joined the NFL pursuant to the merger of the AFL and NFL that had been agreed to three years earlier. The Patriots were merged into the American Football Conference (AFC), where they remain to the present day. However, the Patriots' first season as part of the NFL resulted in a record of 2–12, giving them sole possession of the newly merged league's worst record. The team lacked stability and was forced to play at four different sites. Finally, the Patriots moved into a new stadium in Foxborough (also known as Foxboro). The stadium, initially named Schaefer Stadium, became Sullivan Stadium in 1983 and ultimately Foxboro Stadium in 1990. 

In February, 1971, the team was renamed the Bay State Patriots.;Boston Globe, &quot;NFL '84 Preview / AFL - 25 Years Later - Patriots Historical Highlights&quot;, August 31, 1984.; After press, fan, and public relations backlash against the prospect of the team becoming known as the &quot;B.S.

Chuck Fairbanks was hired as head coach and general manager in 1973 after leading a top-ten program at the University of Oklahoma. Prior to the hiring of Fairbanks, New England had its sight set on Penn State head coach Joe Paterno.Paterno however, ultimately declined the move, and remained at Penn State. ; http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E1D61038F930A25752C0A964948260 Paterno Rejects Patriots ] The New York Times.

Plunkett was traded to the San Francisco 49ers and replaced by Steve Grogan.

=1976-1984=
After the string of losing seasons, the Patriots finished the 1976 season with an 11–3 mark &amp;mdash; the best record in team history to that point &amp;mdash; and a playoff slot for the first time since 1963. In the first round of the NFL playoffs, 1976-77|1976 playoffs, the Patriots lost to the Oakland Raiders 24–21. In 1978, Fairbanks was fired as head coach when it was revealed that he had been secretly hired as the new head coach of the University of Colorado. Fairbanks was replaced by Ron Erhardt, who coached the team to a playoff appearance later that year. The Patriots lost to the Houston Oilers in the NFL playoffs, 1978-79|first round. The following year under new coach Ron Meyer, the Patriots were once again eliminated in the NFL playoffs, 1982-83|first game &amp;mdash; this time by the Miami Dolphins.

Local resident Doug Flutie was a member of the Patriots during the 1987 and 1988 seasons, in which they finished with records of 8–7 and 9–7, respectively. Berry remained head coach through both seasons.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Patriots' lack of playoff appearances was underscored by personnel changes and controversy within the Sullivan ownership.;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158261525X Book discussing various aspects of the Patriots sports franchise] Website accessed January 31, 2006.; The Sullivan family lost millions of dollars on investments, including The Jacksons' 1984 Victory tour.These financial losses and demands forced the Sullivans to sell the team.In 1986, Francis W.

The Patriots' worst season in franchise history &amp;mdash; a 1-15 record &amp;mdash; came under Rust in 1990. During the season, the Patriots were thrown into the middle of a sexual harassment scandal when ''Boston Herald'' reporter Lisa Olson was sexually and verbally assaulted by several Patriots players in the team's locker room and was later labeled a &quot;classic bitch&quot; by Kiam. Following an investigation into the scandal, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue fined the team $50,000, and players Zeke Mowatt, Michael Timpson and Robert Perryman $12,500, $5,000, and $5,000 respectively. Rust was fired and replaced by Dick MacPherson at the end of the season.

In 1992, St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis businessman James Orthwein became sole owner of the Patriots franchise, sparking rumors of a possible relocation of the team to St. Louis.

Orthwein takes over the franchise, which sparks controversy over a possible franchise relocation. Accessed 31 January 2006.;

During the 1992–1993 offseason, the Patriots shifted gears by replacing MacPherson with Bill Parcells. The team's draft selections during the offseason included top overall pick Drew Bledsoe, who was quarterback of the team until 2001, and wide receiver Troy Brown who last season became the team record holder for most receptions.Troy Brown would also play as a defensive back in the Belichick era, scoring touchdowns both on interceptions and as a receiver. Despite these acquisitions, the 1993 season resulted in 5-11 record as Parcells began rebuilding, and rumors about relocating to St. Louis rekindled during the offseason. However, before he could move the team to St. Louis, Orthwein had to get out of the lease on Foxboro Stadium, owned by Robert Kraft. When Orthwein offered Kraft $75 million to buy out the remaining years on the lease, Kraft turned it down;[http://www.patriots.com/team/index.cfm?ac=mgersexecsbio&amp;bio=547 Patriots.com Robert Kraft Biography]. Biographical info on Kraft including events leading up to the buyout. Accessed 3 April 2007;, forcing Orthwein to put the franchise up for sale. 

Using the stadium lease as leverage, Kraft was able to buy the Patriots in January of 1994, paying a record (at the time) $200 million for the team.More importantly, in the view of the region's media, he immediately announced that the team would stay in New England;[http://www.patriots.com/history/index.cfm?ac=History Patriots History]. Kraft takes over in 1994, saving the team from a move. Accessed 31 January 2006.;.

Kraft made a commitment to Patriots fans that he would bring a Super Bowl and a state of the art facility for the team to New England.On the day the NFL approved his purchase, the fans responded by buying almost 6,000 season tickets en route to selling out every game for the first time in the team's 34-year history. Every home game has been sold out since.

Despite the marketing successes, the relationship between Kraft and Parcells was strained.It got worse with time as new owners with their net worth on the line were unwilling to give carte blanche to Parcells' spending on the football side. The Krafts believed in giving management plenty of space, but not carte blanche without questions and answers. Parcells felt Kraft was interfering with his prerogatives and with what was needed to run a successful winning football franchise, especially in light of the new NFL salary cap which took effect in 1994. The result was a management stalemate with declining good will that eventually led to Bill Belichick, the newly hired Assistant Head Coach, having to mediate between the two during the 1996 season.The management conflict also led to the distracting and disruptive rumors that Parcells was leaving the franchise; rumors that dominated the news prior to the team's participation in Super Bowl XXXI (as double-digit under dogs), despite the fact that Parcells was under contract through the 1997 season. At one point prior to the AFC title game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Boston Globe columnist Will McDonough, who had excellent relationships with both the Krafts and Parcells, actually maneuvered the two into a meeting to settle their differences (January 12th, 1997&amp;mdash;the morning of the AFC Championship game;;). Team president Jonathan Kraft is quoted by writer Michael Holley in ''Patriot Reign'' as saying ''&quot;It was a very, very strange time, and when you are not an expert at this business&amp;mdash;you know we were still very new to the business&amp;mdash;it can be educational. Big Bill had kept us in the dark on a lot of things. He probably misled us on some things. And we didn't know how to go about questioning it.&quot;;;

New England entered the 1994 season after drafting defensive end Willie McGinest, the first round and fourth overall pick, who would later play linebacker on all three Super Bowl-winning teams.The 1994 club struggled to 3-6 but rallied to defeat the Minnesota Vikings in overtime and finished the season with a record of 10-6.Although the team lost in the first round of the NFL playoffs, 1994-95|playoffs and finished the 1995 season with a 6–10 record, Kraft decided to keep Parcells; however, Parcells was forced to give up control of player personnel, creating a divided structure Belichick would later put an end to&amp;mdash;but not until 2001.In 1996, the Patriots finished with an 11–5 record and won the AFC East division championship, advancing to Super Bowl XXXI, where they were double-digit underdogs and lost to the Green Bay Packers 35–21.

=1997-1999=
Due to rising tensions between Parcells and Kraft, Parcells resigned and was replaced by Pete Carroll in 1997. Meanwhile, the Patriots and the New York Jets began switching players and coaches, including Parcells and running back Curtis Martin. Nevertheless, New England finished with a 10–6 record and took first place in the AFC East. The Patriots defeated the Miami Dolphins 17–3 at home in the opening round of the playoffs before losing against the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 7–6. In the 1998 season, the Patriots finished 9–7 and lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars in the first round of the playoffs. A subpar 1999 season followed in which the Patriots jumped to a 6-2 record but collapsed after their bye week to finish 8-8.The second half of the season resulted in Carroll's firing.

After Carroll was fired, Bill Belichick, hand-picked to be Parcells' successor with the Jets, quit after one day as Jets head coach to join New England.Belichick's first season in 2000 resulted in a 5–11 record. In 2001, quarterback Drew Bledsoe was injured in the second game of the season and was replaced by Tom Brady, a sixth-round draft pick, who then led the team into the playoffs with an 11–5 record. The Patriots defeated the Oakland Raiders in the so-called &quot;The Tuck&quot; game played in a driving snowstorm in Foxborough (it was also notable for being the final game in Foxboro Stadium), followed by defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in the NFL playoffs, 2004-05|AFC Championship Game.That set up the team's third trip to New Orleans and Super Bowl XXXVI, where they defeated the St. Louis Rams on a last-second field goal by Adam Vinatieri.

Later in the season, the Patriots lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, which halted their winning streak at 21 games.

The Patriots NFL Cheerleaders are simply known as the The Patriots Cheerleaders. In 2005, cheerleader Kristin Gauvin won Miss Massachusetts, in part from her local commitment with the Patriots.

End-zone militia
During each game, about 10 men dressed as minutemen line the back of each end zone.When the Patriots score a touchdown or field goal, the militia behind the opposite end zone fire a round of blanks from flintlock muskets.After the point-after-touchdown (PAT) attempt, the men fire their guns to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.ESPN named this one of the top ten celebrations in the league in 2007;[http://sports.espn.go.com/travel/news/story?id=3139628 ESPN.com] It's a Celebration: Best NFL Touchdown Celebrations, Josh Pahigian, 12/3/07;.

Radio and television
As of 2007, the Patriots' flagship radio station is WBCN 104.1FM, owned by CBS Radio. The larger radio network is called the &quot;Patriots Rock Radio Network,&quot; whose 35 affiliate stations span 7 states. Gil Santos and Gino Cappelletti are the longtime announcing team.
