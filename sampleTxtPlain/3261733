''Pan's Labyrinth'' (Spanish: ''El Laberinto del Fauno''; translates as ''The Labyrinth of the Faun'') is an Academy Award–winning Spanish language fantasy film;;;; written and directed by Mexican film-maker Guillermo del Toro.It was produced and distributed by the Mexican film company Esperanto Films.

''Pan's Labyrinth'' takes place in a dual setting; in the &quot;real world&quot;, the story is set in Spain during the turbulent period shortly after the Spanish Civil War, and tells an allegorical story of a girl named Ofelia who is given three tasks by a mysterious faun. Meanwhile, her stepfather, the Falangist Captain Vidal, viciously hunts the Spanish Maquis, guerrillas who continued fighting the Franco regime in the region, as her pregnant mother grows ill. The alternate setting is a secret &quot;dream world&quot; or &quot;fantasy world&quot; that Ofelia enters through an overgrown labyrinth garden, where she meets all manner of strange and magical creatures who become central to her story. The film employed make-up, puppetry, and CGI effects to create its fantasy creatures.

Del Toro stated that he considers the story to be a parable, influenced by fairy tales, and that it addresses and continues themes related to to his earlier film ''The Devil's Backbone'',; a spiritual sequel, though not an actual sequel. The original Spanish title refers to the mythological fauns of Greek mythology, while the English title refers specifically to the faun-like Greek god Pan. However, Del Toro has stated that the faun in the film is not Pan.; 

The film premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival.It was released in the United Kingdom on November 24 2006. In the United States and Canada, the film was given a limited release on December 29, 2006, with a nationwide release on January 19, 2007.;;''Pan's Labyrinth'' has won numerous international awards, including three Academy Awards, the Ariel Award for Best Picture, and the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form.

Plot
;

The movie opens with a fairy tale. Princess Moanna of the Underground Realm, curious about the world above, escapes to the Earth, where she succumbs to pain, sickness and sadness, and eventually dies.The king believes that her spirit will come back to the underworld someday.

The story then cuts to post-Civil War Spain in 1944, with Francisco Franco firmly in power. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a young girl who loves fairy tales, travels with her pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to meet Captain Vidal (Sergi López i Ayats), her new stepfather and father of Carmen's unborn child. Vidal, the son of a famed commander who died in combat in Morocco, believes strongly in falangism and was assigned to root out any anti-fascist rebels.

Ofelia discovers a large insect resembling a stick insect which she believes to be a fairy. It follows her to the mill where Vidal is stationed and leads Ofelia into an ancient labyrinth nearby. Before Ofelia can enter, she is stopped by Mercedes (Maribel Verdú), Vidal's housekeeper, who is spying for the rebels. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia's bedroom where it changes into a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth.There, she meets the faun (Doug Jones), who believes her to be Princess Moanna.He gives her three tasks to complete before the full moon to ensure that her &quot;essence is intact&quot;. Meanwhile, Vidal brutally kills two farmers suspected of being rebels. After looking in their bag it is clear that they were hunting rabbits as they had said and were not rebels.

The faun gives Ofelia the Book of Crossroads, which explains her tasks.Ofelia completes the first task of retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad that lives deep beneath the roots of a fig tree. Ofelia is becoming more worried about her mother, who has been ordered to stay in bed as her condition has worsened. The faun gives Ofelia a mandrake root. Accompanied by three fairy guides, Ofelia then undertakes the second task of retrieving an ornate dagger from the lair of the Pale Man (Jones as well), a gruesome, child-eating monster who sits motionless in front of a large feast.Although she was gravely warned not to consume anything or face death, she eats two grapes, awakening and angering the Pale Man. He eats two of the fairies and chases her, but she manages to escape by drawing a new door with the a magic piece of chalk that the Faun gave her. Later Ofelia puts the root under Carmen's bed. When it is set in a bowl of milk it animates and after being fed two drops of blood it instantly begins to cure her mother's illness. Ofelia asks one thing of her brother to keep their mother alive and in return make him the prince of her underworld.Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give her the third task.

Meanwhile, Vidal becomes increasingly vicious, torturing a captured rebel.Vidal also kills the doctor who euthanized the tortured prisoner to stop his pain, because the doctor disobeys orders to heal the prisoner so that more torture can be administered; the Captain also discovered evidence that he was aiding the guerrillas. Meanwhile Vidal catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root. Rising from her bed, Carmen throws it into the fireplace where it then begins to scream. Instantly, she develops painful contractions and dies giving birth to a son. Vidal discovers that Mercedes is a spy, and he captures her and Ofelia as they attempt to escape. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, and Mercedes is taken to be tortured; however, she frees herself using a hidden knife, badly injures Vidal, threatens to hurt him further if he hurts Ofelia and flees into the woods where the rebels rescue her.

The faun returns to Ofelia and gives her one more chance to prove herself. He tells her to take her baby brother into the labyrinth. She then uses the magic chalk to sneak into Vidal's room. Ofelia steals the baby after sedating Vidal; although disoriented, Vidal continues to chase her through the labyrinth while the rebels attack the mill. The faun tells Ofelia that the portal to the underworld will open only with the blood of an innocent, so he needs a drop of her brother's blood. Ofelia refuses to harm her brother and the faun disappears. Vidal finds her, takes the baby and shoots Ofelia in the stomach. She falls to the ground, bleeding to death.

When Vidal leaves the labyrinth the rebels and Mercedes are waiting for him. Knowing that he will die, he calmly hands Mercedes the baby. He takes out his watch, ready to break it so his son will know at what time his father died and tells Mercedes to tell his son when he grows up what time his father died, reflecting his own father's death. Mercedes refuses, telling him that his son will never even know his name. Pedro, one of the rebels and Mercedes' brother, draws his weapon and shoots Vidal in the face, killing him.

As Mercedes enters the labyrinth and sits over the dying girl, humming her lullaby, drops of Ofelia's blood drip onto the altar which was the gateway into the underworld. The scene flashes to a dream like state: Ofelia is reunited in spirit with the king and queen (who is her mother) of the underworld. The Faun is there with his fairy companions flying around him (including the ones previously eaten by the monster). She learns that sacrificing herself, instead of her brother, was the final task and she has proven herself to be the Princess Moanna and has achieved immortality. The moment Ofelia learns she is the Princess, she smiles, and at that same instant, (Sending us back to her laying there) she also dies.

=Influences=
The idea for ''Pan's Labyrinth'' came from Guillermo del Toro's notebooks, which he says are filled with &quot;doodles, ideas, drawings, and plot bits.&quot; He had been keeping these notebooks for twenty years.;; At one point during production, he left the notebook in a taxi and was distraught, but the cabbie returned it to him two days later.;; Though he originally wrote a story about a pregnant woman who falls in love with a faun,;; Sergi López said that del Toro described the final version of the plot a year and a half before filming. Lopez said that &quot;for two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written.'&quot; López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he's said that &quot;it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head.&quot; ;;

Del Toro has said the film has strong connections in theme to ''The Devil's Backbone'' and should be seen as an informal sequel dealing with some of the issues raised there. Some of the other works he drew on for inspiration include Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, Jorge Luis Borges' ''Ficciones'', Arthur Machen's ''The Great God Pan'' and ''The White People'', Lord Dunsany's ''The Blessing of Pan'', Algernon Blackwood's ''Pan's Garden'' and Francisco Goya's works. In 2004, del Toro said: &quot;Pan is an original story. Some of my favorite writers (Borges, Blackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god Pan and the symbol of the labyrinth. These are things that I find very compelling (remember the labyrinth image on ''Hellboy''?) and I am trying to mix them and play with them.&quot;; [http://www.deltorofilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=28#28 Del Toro message board, Answers Archive Wed Nov 24, 2004 1:27 am], repost from elsewhere; Retrieved 20 August 2007; It was also influenced by the illustrations of Arthur Rackham.;; 

There are differing ideas about the film's religious influences. Del Toro himself has said that he considers ''Pan's Labyrinth'' &quot;a truly profane film, a layman's riff on Catholic dogma&quot;, but that his friend Alejandro González Iñárritu described it as &quot;a truly Catholic film&quot;. Del Toro's explanation is &quot;once a Catholic, always a Catholic&quot;.;;

Guillermo Navarro, the director of photography, said that &quot;after doing work in Hollywood on other movies and with other directors, working in our original language in different scenery brings me back to the original reasons I wanted to make movies, which is basically to tell stories with complete freedom and to let the visuals really contribute to the telling of the story.&quot;;;

=Casting=
*Ivana Baquero as Ofelia: Del Toro says he was &quot;scared shitless&quot; in casting the right actress for the lead role, and that finding the 10-year-old Spanish actress was purely accidental. (The film was shot June-October 2005, when she was 11.) &quot;The character I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9, and Ivana came in and she was a little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first reading, my wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age.&quot;;; Baquero says that del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairytales to help her &quot;get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt&quot;. She says she thought the film was &quot;marvelous&quot;, and that &quot;At the same time it can bring you pain and sadness and scariness and happiness.&quot;;
*Sergi López i Ayats as Captain Vidal: Del Toro met with López in Barcelona, a year and a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. In Spain, López was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the producers told del Toro &quot;You should be very careful because you don't know about these things because you're Mexican, but this guy is not going to be able to deliver the performance&quot;; del Toro replied &quot;Well, it's not that I don't know, it's that I don't care.&quot;;; Of his character, López said he is &quot;the most evil character I've ever played in my career. It is impossible to improve upon it; the character is so solid and so well written. Vidal is deranged, a psychopath who is impossible to defend. Even though his father's personality marked his existence &amp;mdash; and is certainly one of the reasons for his mental disorder &amp;mdash; that cannot be an excuse. It would seem to be very cynical to use that to justify or explain his cruel and cowardly acts. I think it is great that the film does not consider any justification of fascism.&quot;;; 
*Doug Jones as The Faun and The Pale Man: Jones had worked with del Toro before on ''Mimic'' and ''Hellboy'', and says the director sent him an email saying, &quot;You must be in this film. No one else can play this part but you.&quot; Jones read an English translation of the script and was enthusiastic but then found out the film was in Spanish, which he did not speak. Jones says he was &quot;terrified&quot; and del Toro suggested learning the script phonetically, or dubbing his lines with a voice-over actor, but Jones rejected both ideas preferring to learn the words himself. He said, &quot;I really, really buckled down and committed myself to learning that word for word and I got the pronunciation semi-right before I even went in,&quot; using the five hours a day he spent getting the costume and make-up on to practice the words.;; Del Toro decided afterwards that he still preferred to dub Jones with the voice of &quot;an authoritative theatre actor,&quot; but Jones's efforts remained valuable because the voice actor was able to easily match his delivery with Jones's mouth movements.;;
*Maribel Verdú as Mercedes: Like López, Verdú was cast against type; usually playing a sex goddess, del Toro selected her to play the compassionate revolutionary because he &quot;saw a sadness in her ... he thought would be perfect for the part&quot;.;
*Ariadna Gil as Carmen: Ofelia's mother and Vidal's wife.
*Alex Angulo as Doctor Ferreiro: a doctor in the service of Vidal who is anti-fascist.
*Manolo Solo as Garces: Vidal's lieutenant.
*César Vea as Serrano: Vidal's lieutenant.
*Roger Casamajor as Pedro: One of the Rebels, and Mercedes' brother.

=Effects=
''Pan's Labyrinth'' employs some computer generated imagery in its effects, but also uses complex make-up and puppetry. The giant toad was inspired by ''The Maze''. Del Toro himself performed the noises. The mandrake root is a combination of puppetry and CGI. Del Toro wanted the fairies &quot;to look like little monkeys, like dirty fairies,&quot; but the animation company had the idea to give them wings made of leaves.;;

Jones spent five hours putting on make-up for the faun, which was mostly latex foam. He operated the faun's legs, while his own were digitally erased. Puppeteers helped to operate his face. Del Toro told Jones to &quot;go rock star... like a glam rocker. But less David Bowie, more Mick Jagger.&quot;; Del Toro also had the faun grow younger as the movie progressed. Jones said that he had to look out of the Pale Man's nostrils. The Pale Man's legs were attached to the front of his over a green leotard.;;

=Subtitles=
The film uses subtitles for its translation into English. Del Toro wrote them himself, because he was disappointed with the subtitles of his previous Spanish film, ''The Devil's Backbone''. In an interview, he said that they were &quot;for the thinking impaired&quot; and &quot;incredibly bad.&quot; He spent a month working with two other people, and said that he didn't want it to &quot;feel like... watching a subtitled film.&quot;;;

Ivana Baquero and Guillermo del Toro at the Elgin Theatre in Toronto, Ontario

Mark Kermode, in ''The Observer'', labeled ''Pan's Labyrinth'' as the best film of 2006, describing it as &quot;an epic, poetic vision in which the grim realities of war are matched and mirrored by a descent into an underworld populated by fearsomely beautiful monsters.&quot;;; Stephanie Zacharek wrote that the film &quot;works on so many levels that it seems to change shape even as you watch it,&quot;;; and Jim Emerson called the film &quot;a fairy tale of such potency and awesome beauty that it reconnects the adult imagination to the primal thrill and horror of the stories that held us spellbound as children.&quot;;; Roger Ebert reviewed the film after his surgery andit was put on his Great Movies series on August 27th, 2007 ;; and when he did his belated top ten films of 2006 Pan's Labyrinth was #1 with him stating &quot;But even in a good year I'm unable to see everything. And I'm still not finished with my 2006 discoveries. I'm still looking at more 2007 movies, too, and that list will run as usual in late December. Nothing I am likely to see, however, is likely to change my conviction that the year's best film was &quot;Pan's Labyrinth.&quot; ;; ''The New Yorkers Anthony Lane took special note of the film's sound design, saying it &quot;discards any hint of the ethereal by turning up the volume on small, supercharged noises: the creak of the Captain's leather gloves... the nighttime complaints of floorboard and rafter....&quot;;; Some reviewers had criticisms, however: for ''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', David Elliott said &quot;the excitement is tangible,&quot; but added that &quot;what it lacks is successful unity... Del Toro has the art of many parts, but only makes them cohere as a sort of fevered extravaganza.&quot; ;; 

During its limited first three weeks at the United States box office, the film made $5.4 million. As of March 1, 2007, it has grossed over $37 million in North America, and grossed $80 million worldwide.; In Spain, it grossed almost $12 million, and it is the fourth highest domestically grossing foreign film in the United States.; It has generated $16 million from its DVD release.;
