The Twin Towers were a Professional wrestling tag team consisting of Akeem &quot;The African Dream&quot; (formerly the One Man Gang) and Big Bossman from 1988 to 1990. They were managed by Slick throughout their run as a team.

Career
The Big Bossman and One Man Gang had previously had a feud, in which Big Bossman won the UWF Heavyweight Championship. Bossman then entered the WWF in 1988 feuding with the arguable top face at that time Hulk Hogan. During this time Akeem &amp; The Big Bossman formed a tag team and called themselves &quot;Twin Towers&quot; and were managed by Slick. The team both competed together and alone against the The Mega Powers (Hogan &amp; Randy Savage). After the Mega Powers broke up, The Twin Towers turned their attention to the tag team division, feuding with the Rockers, Demolition, and others. After WrestleMania the team restarted their feud with Hogan, giving Bossman a WWF Title shot, which he lost. Also at this time they teamed with Andre the Giant losing to Jim Duggan and Demolition at SummerSlam 1989.

Break up
Later that year The Twin Towers broke up and the Big Boss Man turned face. This led to a match at WrestleMania VI in which the Bossman, without Slick, won over Akeem. Subsequently, The Boss Man later began teaming up with his former foe, Hulk Hogan, against many forces. Akeem would leave the WWF in October 1990.
