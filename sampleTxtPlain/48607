Memphis is a city in the southwest corner of Tennessee, and the county seat of Shelby County. Memphis rises above the Mississippi River on the 4th Chickasaw Bluff just below the mouth of the Wolf River. As of 2006, Memphis had an estimated population of 670,902, making it the largest city in the state of Tennessee, the second largest in the southeastern region (only to Jacksonville, Florida), and the 17th largest in the United States ;. The greater Memphis metropolitan area area, including the adjacent areas of Mississippi and Arkansas, has a population of 1,260,581. This makes Memphis the second largest metropolitan area in Tennessee, surpassed only by metropolitan Nashville. Memphis is the youngest of Tennessee's four major cities (traditionally including Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Nashville). A resident of Memphis is referred to as a Memphian and the Memphis region is known as the Mid-South.

History
Mississippi River landing, Memphis, 1906The Memphis area was first settled by the Mississippian Culture and then by the Chickasaw Indian tribe.
European exploration came years later, with Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto believed to have visited what is now the Memphis area as early as the 1540s. By the 1680s, French explorers led by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle built Fort Prudhomme in the vicinity, the first European settlement in what would become Memphis, predating English settlements in East Tennessee by more than 70 years. ;[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=F047 Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture - Fort Prudhomme and La Salle];

Despite such early outposts, the land comprising present-day Memphis remained in a largely unorganized territory throughout most of the 18th century, while the boundaries of what would become Tennessee continued to evolve from its parent — the Carolina Colony, later North Carolina and South Carolina. By 1796, the community was the westernmost point of the newly admitted state of Tennessee.Cotton merchants on Union Avenue, Memphis in 1937

Memphis was founded in 1820 by John Overton, James Winchester, and Andrew Jackson and was incorporated as a city in 1826.The city was named after the ancient capital of Egypt on the Nile River.

The cotton economy of the antebellum South depended on the forced labor of large numbers of African-American slaves, and Memphis became a major slave market. Slaves seeking their freedom turned to the Underground Railroad to escape to the free states of the North, and the Memphis home of Jacob Burkle was a way-station on their route to freedom.

At the time of the American Civil War, Memphis was already an important regional city because of its river trade and railroad connections, particularly the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, completed in 1857.Tennessee#History|Tennessee seceded from the Union in June 1861 and Memphis briefly became a Confederate stronghold.Union forces captured Memphis from Confederacy in the Battle of Memphis on June 6, 1862, and the city remained under Union control for the duration of the war, except for a dramatic raid conducted by Nathan Bedford Forrest. Memphis became a Union supply base and continued to prosper throughout the war.

Extensive yellow fever epidemics in the 1870s (1873, 1878, 1879) devastated the city.At that time it was not understood that this fatal disease was carried by a mosquito vector, so public health measures were unsuccessful.So many died or fled the epidemics that in 1879 Memphis lost its city charter and until 1893 Memphis was governed as merely a taxing district.;[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=M069 Memphis];Eventually improvements in sanitation removed the breeding grounds of the mosquito vector and the citybegan to grow again. In 1897, Memphis' pyramid-shaped pavilion was a conspicuous part of the Tennessee Centennial exposition.

Memphis grew into the world's largest spot cotton market (over 40% of the nation's crop was traded here) and the world's largest hardwood lumber market. Into the 1950s, it was the world's largest mule market.;[http://www.cityofmemphis.org/framework.aspx?page=296 City of Memphis Website - History of Memphis];From the 1910s to the 1950s, Memphis was a hotbed of machine politics under the direction of E. H. Crump|E. H. &quot;Boss&quot; Crump.During the Crump era, Memphis developed an extensive network of parks and public works as part of the national City Beautiful Movement.During the 1960s the city was at the center of civil rights issues, notably the location of a sanitation workers' strike. Memphis is also where Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968 at the Lorraine Motel, the day after giving his prophetic &quot;I've Been to the Mountaintop&quot; speech at the Mason Temple.

Jazz musician, Memphis, 1939Memphis is well known for its cultural contributions to the identity of the American south. Beginning in the early 20th Century Memphis became famous for the innovative strains of African-American music, including gospel, blues, jazz, soul, and Rhythm and Blues genres, a tradition that continues to this day.Many notable blues musicians grew up in and around the Memphis and northern Mississippi, and performed there regularly. These included such musical greats as Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson, B.B. King, and Howlin' Wolf. The first African American-formatted radio station, WDIA, was founded in the city in 1947 by Bert Ferguson and John Pepper, and included a young B. B. King as disc jockey. B. B. King's moniker was derived from his WDIA nickname 'Beale Street Blues Boy', a reference to Memphis' Beale Street on which many nightclubs and blues venues were located.The young Elvis Presley frequently listened to gospel and soul music, and many of his early recordings were inspired or written by African-American composers and recording artists in the Mid-South area.;Peter Guralnick. New York Times, August 11, 2007;

In addition to a rich musical heritage, Memphis also boasts a long culinary legacy dominated by regional barbecue. Regional variations of barbecue#Memphis|Memphis barbecue is rendered distinct by its sole usage of pork (as opposed to beef), focus on rib and shoulder cuts of meat, and multiple locally-owned barbecue restaurants. Celebration of this local dish reaches its climax each year in May, when the Memphis in May Festival holds its annual [http://memphisinmay.org/wbcc.htm World-Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest].

Geography and climate
The Mud Island monorail on Front St in downtown Memphis
Memphis is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 313.8&amp;nbsp;square miles (763.4&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 302.3&amp;nbsp;square miles (723.4&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 15.4&amp;nbsp;square miles (40.0&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (5.24%) is water.

= Climate=
Memphis has a humid subtropical climate, with four distinct seasons. The summer months (late May to late September) are persistently hot (between 68 °F [20 °C] and 95 °F [35 °C]) and humid due to moisture encroaching from the Gulf of Mexico. Afternoon thunderstorms are frequent during some summers, but usually brief, lasting no longer than an hour. Early Autumn is pleasantly drier and mild, but can remain hot until late October. Abrupt but short-lived cold snaps are common. Late Autumn is rainy and colder, December being the third rainiest month of the year. Fall foliage becomes especially vibrant after the first frost, typically November, and lasts until early December. Winters are mild, but cold snaps can occur. The official all-time record low temperature was -13.0 °F (-25.0 °C), which occurred on December 24, 1963. Mild spells are sometimes warm with temperatures as high as 75 °F (23 °C) during January and February. Snowfall is not abundant but does occur during most winters, with an annual average of 5.7 inches (14.4 cm) at the airport. Spring often begins in late February or early March, following the onset of a sharp warmup. This season is also known as &quot;severe weather season&quot; due to the higher frequency of tornadoes, hail, and thunderstorms producing winds greater than 58 mph (93 km/h). Average rainfall is slightly higher during the spring months (except November) than the rest of the year, but not
to any noticeable extent. Historically, April is the month with the highest frequency of tornadoes, though tornadoes have occurred every month of the year. Memphis is sunny approximately 64% of the time.

The city of Memphis is located in southwestern Tennessee and sits on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River. It is the regional hub for a tri-state area of Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. Interstate 40 enters the city from the northeast, and loops above the central part of the city, exiting across the Mississippi River and travelling to the west. Interstate 55 approaches the city from the south and connects with I-240, which completes the loop around central Memphis with I-40, and also leaves to the west. U.S. Highway 72 leaves the city traveling to the southeast.The west end of [http://www.geocities.com/usend7079/End078/end078.htm U.S. Highway 78] begins in Memphis, TN on Linden Avenue at the intersection of 2nd Street.As it leaves Memphis, US 78 follows Lamar Avenue, historically known as ''Pidgeon Roost Road'' for the nestings of passenger pigeons formerly in the vicinity.The east end of U.S. Highway 78 terminates in Charleston, South Carolina.

= Aquifer=
Shelby County is located over four natural aquifers, one of which is recognized as the &quot;Memphis sand aquifer&quot; or simply as the &quot;Memphis aquifer.&quot; This particular water source, located some 350 to 1100 feet underground, is stated to contain more than 100 trillion US gallons (380 km³) of water by Memphis Light, Gas, and Water;[http://mlgw.com/SubView.php?key=about_ourutilservices Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Website - About Our Services];, which draws, verifies the cleanliness of, and distributes the water to over 250,000 customers. Furthermore, in the time since the tapping of the well in 1887, the aquifer has only descended 125 feet, suggesting a reliable water source in Memphis for years to come.;
; Most Memphians recognize this as their primary water source, and take great regional pride in their possession of the aquifer.Memphis water is notably soft, low in mineral content, and free of toxic substances.;[http://www.mlgw.com/images/2005_wateranalysis.pdf MLGW - 2005 Water Quality Table];

Sections and suburbs


The core of Memphis is marked by five major districts, with smaller districts lying within their borders. These are Downtown, Midtown, North Memphis, South Memphis, and East Memphis. In recent decades the city has expanded further by annexing adjacent territories, so these names can be somewhat misleading to those who are unfamiliar to the area.

The city is also home to the world's busiest cargo airport, in terms of tonnage, which serves as the primary hub for FedEx shipping. Due to its location, more major metro areas can be reached overnight from Memphis than any other city in the central U.S. Memphis has also developed as a major manufacturing center of textiles, heating equipment, pianos, and automobile and truck parts. Memphis Light, Gas and Water (&quot;MLG&amp;W&quot;) is also one of the largest municipal utilities in the United States.

Memphis is home to a growing number of nationally and internationally known corporations, including approximately 150 businesses from 22 countries. This includes the corporate headquarters of FedEx Corporation, AutoZone Incorporated and International Paper. It is also, home to Fred's Stores headquarters, a company which was named as one of the five fastest growing chain-stores by Forbes Magazine. Other corporations with a major presence in the area include Back Yard Burgers, Belz Enterprises, Buckeye Technologies, First Horizon National Corporation, Guardsmark, Hohenberg Bros. Co., Harrah's, Hilton, ServiceMaster, and Morgan Keegan &amp; Company, Inc. Northwest Airlines also operates a major hub at Memphis International Airport, with daily nonstop flights to Amsterdam.

The entertainment and film industry has also developed in recent years in the city. Several major motion pictures have been filmed in Memphis in recent years, including ''Making the Grade'' (1984), U2: Rattle &amp; Hum, (1988) ''Mystery Train'' (1989), ''Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!'' (1989), Trespass, (1991) ''The Firm'' (1993), ''A Family Thing'' (1996), ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' (1996), ''The Rainmaker'' (1997), ''Cast Away'' (2000), ''The Queens of Comedy'' (2001), ''21 Grams'' (2003), ''Hustle &amp; Flow'' (2005), ''Walk the Line'' (2005), ''Forty Shades Of Blue'' (2005), and ''Black Snake Moan'' (2007).

The city appeared in the top eight of the 50 best major metro areas in the U.S. for starting and growing a business in 2000, according to ''Inc. magazine''. ''Southern Business and Development'' magazine ranked Memphis as one of the most successful models for economic development in the south, also recognized the city as one of the top ten markets over the past decade. In October 2002, ''Ebony Magazine'' has cited Memphis as a city for its outstanding African-American leadership.

Infrastructure
= Government=
Memphis is governed by a mayor and thirteen council members, six elected at large from throughout the city and seven elected from geographic districts. In 1995, the council adopted a new district plan which changed council positions to all districts. This plan provides for nine districts, seven with one representative each and two districts with three representatives each.

The current mayor of the city of Memphis is Dr. W. W. Herenton, a formidable and controversial local political figure. Dr. Herenton is currently serving his fourth consecutive term as Mayor. He was elected for the first time in 1991, when he became Memphis' first elected black mayor. (J.O. Patterson, Jr., had previously served as mayor on an interim basis, thus preventing Herenton from actually being the first black mayor.)Prior to his election, Dr. Herenton served for 12 years as the superintendent of Memphis City Schools.

In recent years, there has been discussion of the potential of a merger of Shelby County and Memphis into a metropolitan government, similar to that in Nashville.

Memphis politics have been very racially--and ideologically--polarized for many years. Most whites have supported the Republican Party since the 1960s, while most blacks have remained loyal to the Democratic Party. A major influence in Memphis' black politics is the Ford family of funeral directors, whose political prominence dates to the Crump era. The best-known member of this family is Harold Ford, Sr., who represented most of Memphis in the U.S. House from 1975 to 1997. His brother, John, was a state senator for 30 years and is currently at the center of the Tennessee Waltz scandal.

The greater part of Memphis is within the Ninth Congressional District, which is represented by the liberal Democrat Steve Cohen.Cohen is the first white Democrat to represent a significant portion of Memphis in over 40 years.The previous representative, Harold Ford, Jr., unsuccessfully ran for the Senate seat vacated by Bill Frist. Much of east Memphis is in the 7th District, represented by the conservative Republican Marsha Blackburn.

= Bridges=
Memphis-Arkansas Memorial Bridge, Frisco Bridge, Harahan Bridge
Four rail and highway bridges cross the Mississippi River at Memphis.They are, in order of construction: the Frisco, Harahan, Memphis-Arkansas, and Hernando de Soto Bridges. The piers of the first three bridges had to be lined up for river navigation as they were built side-by-side at a narrow point in the river.

The Frisco Bridge (May 12, 1892) was the longest bridge in North America when it opened and was originally called the ''Great Bridge at Memphis''. This cantilever truss steel railroad bridge was built between 1888–1892.It was designed by George S. Morison, who also designed the Taft Bridge in Washington D.C.

The Harahan Bridge (July 14, 1916) is a trestle railroad bridge to which later were added narrow, one-way wooden cantilevering roadways along the outsides of bridge so it could be used for cars. In 1928, sparks from a train ignited and set on fire to one of the wooden plank roads. Today, only trains use the Harahan Bridge but there are plans to add a pedestrian walkway and bike path.

View of the Hernando de Soto Bridge from the Tennessee side of the river.
The Memphis-Arkansas Bridge (December 17, 1949), originally named E. H. Crump Bridge, carries Interstate 55 and has a pedestrian walkway. The bridge was built between 1945–1949 and is the longest Warren truss- style bridge in the United States. It is listed on the National Historic Register.

The Hernando de Soto Bridge (August 2, 1973) with its steel arches carries I-40. In 1986, &quot;M&quot; shaped lights became part of the bridge and a Memphis landmark. The Guinness Book of World Records list the deSoto bridge for its unique structural &quot;letter&quot; shape.In 2001 the mysterious disappearance and death of Harvard University biophysicistDon Wiley, whose abandoned car was found on the bridge, brought the Hernando de Soto Bridge national headlines.;[http://www.laskerfoundation.org/news/wiley.html Don C.
