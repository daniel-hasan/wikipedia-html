 The initial seat distribution of the 39th Canadian Parliament
Stephen Harper is Prime Minister during the 39th Canadian Parliament.He is seen here giving his victory speech after the 2006 federal election which ended thirteen years of Liberal rule.

The 39th Canadian Parliament is the current Parliament of Canada, and has been in session since April 3, 2006.;;The membership was set by the 2006 federal election on January 23, 2006, and it has changed only somewhat due to resignations and by-elections.;The longest it could run, barring war or national emergency, is until October 19, 2009 due to Bill C-16, passed by this Parliament.Historically, however, minority governments in Canada such as the current one have rarely lasted more than two years.

It is controlled by a Conservative Party minority, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the 28th Canadian Ministry, which assumed power on February 6, 2006.;;The Official Opposition is the Liberal Party, led first by interim leader Bill Graham, and currently by Stéphane Dion.;;

The Speaker is Liberal Peter Milliken.Milliken was re-elected as the Speaker of the House for the 39th Parliament on April 3, 2006. The Speaker only votes in a tie, and, as Milliken is a Liberal, the Liberal caucus is effectively reduced by one.;This, along with the defection of Wajid Khan to the Conservatives enables the Conservatives to pass legislation with the cooperation of any one of the three opposition parties: Liberals, Bloc Québécois, or New Democratic Party (NDP).

There have been two sessions of the 39th Parliament;;

The party standings as elected and as of November 24, 2007, are on the table below.Since the election, four members of the House of Commons crossed the floor (two of whom had previously been forced to sit as an independent), one died, eight resigned, and five members have been elected in by-elections to fill vacancies (four vacancies remain to be filled).In that same period, two senators have died, six have resigned (four of whom had reached the mandatory retirement age), and one has been appointed to fill a vacancy (twelve vacancies remain).Step-by-step changes are listed in the 39th Canadian Parliament#Members|Members section.See List of Canadian federal electoral districts for a list of the ridings in this parliament.





Major events
=Floor-crossing=
Four members of parliament have crossed the floor since the election: 

On February 6, 2006, David Emerson, elected as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Vancouver Kingsway, crossed the floor to join Stephen Harper's cabinet as Minister of International Trade.;;

On January 5, 2007, Wajid Khan, elected as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Mississauga—Streetsville, crossed the floor to join the Conservative Party.;;

On February 6, 2007, Garth Turner, elected as a Conservative MP for Halton, moved to the Liberal caucus.He had been sitting as an Independent since being suspended from the Tory caucus on October 18, 2006.;;

On June 26, 2007, Joe Comuzzi, elected as a Liberal MP for Thunder Bay&amp;mdash;Superior North, moved to the Conservative caucus.He had been sitting as an Independent since being suspended from the Liberal caucus on March 21, 2007.;;

On 23 November, 2007, Wajid Khan announced that he would withdraw from the Conservative caucus and sit as an Independent MP.

=Liberal leadership=
During the election campaign, the Liberal leader was then Prime Minister Paul Martin. After the election results were announced, Liberal leader Paul Martin announced his intention to resign, but did not indicate when, other than saying he would not lead the party into the next election. On February 1, the Liberal Party Caucus chose Bill Graham as parliamentary leader, meaning he served as Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons until the election of Stéphane Dion as Liberal leader at the next Liberal Party leadership convention, held December 2 through December 3.

Some political observers had questioned whether Martin would have led the Liberals into an election had the Harper minority fallen in the first few months of the 39th Parliament.;;In 1979,Pierre Trudeau's Liberals lost to Joe Clark's Progressive Conservatives who only won a minority on May 22 of that year. The Clark minority was defeated less than seven months after on a confidence vote over the budget, which was much earlier than most observers had expected the government to fall. Trudeau had announced his resignation as leader of the Liberals on November 21, 1979; however in light of the collapse of the government on December 13, 1979, and the Liberal Party's not having chosen a replacement as leader, Trudeau was persuaded to change his mind, and he led the party into the 1980 election winning a majority government. Unlike Martin, Trudeau did not appoint an interim leader or withdraw from the day-to-day leadership of the party after announcing he would resign. 

On March 18, 2006 Martin officially tendered his resignation as Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada.;; This move was widely seen as a move by Martin to stop any talk of him leading the party into the next election.

=Five priorities=
Prime Minister Harper has said he will move forward with his top five priorities from the campaign.At least four of these will require legislative action: the passage of a ''Federal Accountability Act'' in response to the sponsorship scandal; combating crime by creating more police officers and setting longer mandatory sentences; lowering the Goods &amp; Services Tax to 6% (and eventually to 5%); giving $1,200 for parents per child under the age of 6.On December 6, 2006, another issue many expected to arise in the first session of parliament did, in fact, come to the fore, when the government introduced a motion calling &quot;on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage without affecting civil unions and while respecting existing same-sex marriages.&quot;The next day, the House defeated the motion by a vote of 175 to 123, with six cabinet ministers voting against it, and Harper declared the issue settled.;; (See Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage for more information.)

=Resignations and By-elections=

On September 20, 2006 Liberal MP Joe Fontana (London North Centre) resigned to run in the London mayoralty election. Fontana was replaced in the riding by Liberal Glen Pearson after a by-election on November 27, 2006.;;

Liberal MP Jean Lapierre declared on January 11, 2007 that he would resign from the Liberal Party at the end of the month to pursue a career in television. This took place on January 28, leaving the Outremont district vacant. On July 28, Prime Minister Stephen Harper called by-elections for this and two other Quebec ridings, which were held on September 17, 2007. Newcomer NDP candidate Thomas Mulcair won this riding over star Liberal candidate Jocelyn Coulon, only the second-ever time Outremont has not been won by a Liberal candidate. Mulcair was previously a Provincial Liberal Cabinet Minister in Quebec.;;

On 21 February 2007, Yvan Loubier (representing Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot for the Bloc Québécois) resigned in order to run in the Quebec general election, 2007. Loubier was replaced in a by-election on September 17, 2007, by newcomer Bloc candidate Ève-Mary Thaï Thi Lac.;;


Bill Graham acted as interim leader of the official opposition until the Liberal leadership convention, after which he resigned his seat.
One day later, on February 22, veteran Liberal MP and former Liberal Party of Canada interim leader Bill Graham announced that he would not seek reelection in the next federal election. On June 19 2007, Graham announced he would be resigning his Toronto Centre seat effective July 2, 2007, to allow former Ontario New Democratic Party Premier and Liberal Party leadership candidate Bob Rae to run in the riding.;;

On March 8, 2007, Liberal MP Jim Peterson announced that he would not be a candidate in the next federal election. Former Liberal Party leadership candidate Martha Hall Findlay was appointed as the Liberal candidate in his Willowdale riding.On June 20, 2007, Peterson followed Bill Graham's lead and announced his resignation from the House of Commons, effective July 12. Both Bill Graham and Jim Peterson resigned their seats early in the hope that Prime Minister Stephen Harper would be compelled to add those vacant seats to the scheduled September 17, 2007 by-elections in Quebec.;; On July 23, the Tory government announced that it would delay the Ontario by-elections so as not to overlap with the impending Ontario general election, 2007 scheduled for October 10, 2007.;;

Also in March 2007, Bloc Québécois MP and former BQ House Leader Michel Gauthier announced that he would not run in the next federal election. He resigned his seat of Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean on July 29, 2007. Gauthier was replaced in a by-election on September 17, 2007, by newcomer Conservative candidate and former Roberval mayor Denis Lebel.;;

On July 5, 2007, Liberal MP Stephen Owen announced he would resign his seat of Vancouver Quadra to accept a position at the University of British Columbia, his resignation effective July 27, 2007.;;

On July 11, 2007, Liberal MP Gary Merasty announced he would resign his Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River seat, due to &quot;family considerations&quot;, effective August 31, 2007.;;
