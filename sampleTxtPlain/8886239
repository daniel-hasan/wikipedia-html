Since 30 May 2003;; the BBC has provided all of the BBC One and BBC Two regional variations on the UK Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|digital satellite service, providing local news inserts and (outside England) regional presentation. Because England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland form the four constituent countries of the UK, technically only the English divisions are ''regions'', with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish divisions being termed ''nations''.;; UK-wide programming is referred to as ''national'' or ''network''.

For Sky Digital subscribers, ex-subscribers or those with ''Freesat from Sky'' cards in their decoder the local version associated with the address to which the card was issued will appear on channels 101 and 102.To watch other regional and national services the viewer chooses the channel numbers listed below.;;.Those using a Sky Digibox without any card are treated as being in London.;; 

Non-Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky Digital satellite parameters for the Astra 2D system are also available.;;

History
From the launch of digital satellite on 1 October 1998 until 31 March 2001, there were four variants (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) of both BBC One and the new BBC Choice carried on all digital platforms. Only one version of BBC Two was available digitally, and this was shown throughout the UK.

BBC English regions became gradually available via Digital Terrestrial Television (later known as Freeview) over the next few years, as did the ''national'' versions of BBC Two. Announced by the BBC on 16 October 2001;; and operating from 28 January 2002 until 29 May 2003 transponder space was allocated to the five largest English regions: BBC London News, South Today, Midlands Today, North West Tonight and Look North (for Yorkshire &amp; Lincolnshire), 'covering 70% of Englandâ€™s population', ;; and were accessed 'using new interactive technology';;. This meant that viewers had to press the &quot;red button&quot; to access the programmes, and could only watch the 6.30pm edition. Later all regions became available as standard, full-time channels.

Eventually, programming via digital mirrored that available via analogue, with the exception of any (now rare) regional variations on BBC Two in England and the extra &quot;opt outs&quot; on BBC Two in Wales.
