Spears's brother Bryan works as a manager for the Spears family interests;; and her sister Jamie Lynn is an actress and singer. Her maternal grandmother Lillian Woolmore was an English war-bride;;, born in Tottenham, London;[http://knowhere.co.uk/3692_heroes.html]; who met Spears's grandfather Barnett O'Field Bridges in England during World War II. Her paternal grandparents were June Austin Spears and Emma Jean Forbes.;;;

Spears was an accomplished gymnast, attending gymnastics classes until age nine and competing in state-level competitions.;; She performed in local dance revues and her local Baptist church choir. At age eight she auditioned for the Disney Channel series ''The New Mickey Mouse Club''. Although she was considered too young to join the series at the time, a producer on the show introduced her to a New York City agent.; Spears subsequently spent three summers at NYC's Professional Performing Arts School and also appeared in a number of off-Broadway productions, including 1991's ''Ruthless!''. In 1992, she landed a spot on the popular television show ''Star Search''. Though she won her first round in the competition, she ultimately lost. At age eleven, Spears returned to the Disney Channel for a spot on the '' The New Mickey Mouse Club'' in Lakeland, Florida.; She was featured on the show from 1993 to 1994, until she was 13.

Music career

Spears's debut single &quot;...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time&quot;, released in the end of 1998 became an instant international success. It peaked at number one on the ''Billboard's'' Hot 100 and sold nine million copies worldwide.;;; and was ranked 25th on ''Rolling Stone'' and MTV's &quot;100 Greatest Pop Songs of all time&quot;.;; The music video accompanying the song featured Spears provocatively dressed in a midriff-baring schoolgirl uniform.;; 

The album of the same title was released in January 1999, reaching number one on the Billboard 200.;; ''...Baby One More Time'' was certified Diamond, with 25 million copies sold worldwide.;;;. The album received mixed reviews. ''All Music Guide'' gave it 4 out of 5 stars, stating that the album &quot;has the same blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry that propelled the New Kids and Debbie Gibson.&quot;;; While ''Rolling Stone'' gave it 2 out of 5, noting that, &quot;While several Cherion-crafted kiddie-funk jams serve up beefy hooks, shameless schlock slowies, like 'E-Mail My Heart', are pure spam.&quot;;; The success of Spears's music coupled with her controversial image made her one of the year's biggest stars.;; 

In December 1999, she won four Billboard Music Awards, including Female Artist of the Year. A month later, she took home the Favorite Pop/Rock New Artist award at the American Music Awards.;; At the 2000 Grammy Awards, Spears received two nominations in the categories of Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for ''...Baby One More Time'', but lost to Christina Aguilera and Sarah McLachlan respectively.;;








Following the success of her previous album, Spears released the album ''Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again'', which debuted at number one in the U.S., selling 1,319,193 units during its first week of sales, breaking the SoundScan record for the highest sales in its debut week by any solo artist.;; The RIAA awarded the album with a Diamond certification with 10 million copies sold in the U.S. and 20 million copies sold worldwide.;;;;; Concerning both musical content and sales, the album was very similar to Spears's debut, although it fared better with critics. ''All Music Guide'' once again gave it 4 out of 5 stars, saying that the album &quot;has the same combination of sweetly sentimental ballads and endearingly gaudy dance-pop that made One More Time.&quot;;; ''Rolling Stone'' gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 by noting the album as &quot;fantastic pop cheese&quot; and &quot;Britney's demand for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary.&quot;;; 

The album’s lead single, &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again&quot;, broke the record for most radio station additions in a single day and quickly became a top ten hit in the U.S. and other countries.;; The same year, Spears launched her first world tour, the &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour&quot;. During the tour, she made a stop in New York for the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. As part of her performance, she ripped off a black suit to reveal a provocative nude-colored and crystal-adorned outfit that generated much controversy.;; She finished the year with two more Billboard Music Awards,;; and two Grammy nominations for ''Oops!... I Did It Again'' in the categories of Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.;;

=2001&amp;ndash;2003: Career development=


Spears performing in September 2003.
Spears released her third studio album ''Britney'' in November 2001. Although not as successful as her previous albums,; she assumed some creative control by co-writing five of the album's tracks.; It surpassed Michael Jackson's album ''Invincible'' when it had a successful debut at number one in the U.S. by selling 745,744 units during its first week.;; To date, ''Britney'' has sold thirteen million copies worldwide.; The album's success made her one of the few female artists to have their first three albums debut at number one.;;;; The album fared well with critics such as ''All Music Guide'' who gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars, describing the album's title tracks as being &quot;pivotal moments on Britney Spears's third album, the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney.&quot;;; In contrast, ''Rolling Stone'' said of the album &quot;''Britney'' belabors the obvious: Spears is one month away from entering her twenties and clearly needs to grow up if she's going to bring her fans along.&quot;;; 

The singles did not perform as well; ''Britneys lead single &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; peaked at 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 making it the album's biggest hit.;; Spears made her third consecutive MTV Video Music Awards performance; in which Spears controversially utilized caged animals and danced erotically with a large albino python draped over her shoulders, performing I'm a Slave 4 U. Animal-rights organization PETA claimed that the animals featured in the performance were mistreated and cancelled plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears.;; To help promote the album, Spears embarked on the &quot;Dream Within a Dream Tour&quot; in November 2001. The tour was forced to cut short in Mexico City due to bad weather.;; 
With the end to her tour, Spears announced she would take a six month break from her career.;; 

Her career success was highlighted by ''Forbes Magazine'' in 2002 as Spears was ranked the world's most powerful celebrity.;; At a performance at the MTV Video Music Awards, she appeared with Christina Aguilera performing the song &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, and was later joined by Madonna. Spears locked lips with Madonna in a highly-publicized kiss.;;;;;;;;








In November 2003, Spears released her fourth studio album, 
''In the Zone'', jettisoning the Max Martin-produced synthpop of her earlier releases. The album took in lesser-known producers such as RedZone and big names including Moby and R. Kelly. Spears co-wrote eight of the album's thirteen songs and co-produced several pieces of her material for the first time. ''In the Zone'' reached #1 in the U.S. charts debut week selling over 609,000 copies. This made Spears the only female in music history to have her first four studio albums debut at number one.;; The album had a mild reception from critics. ''Stylus Magazine'' gave the album a D and even blamed Spears's career choices by stating, &quot;Ultimately, ''In the Zone'' suffers greatly from Britney's uneasy transition from teen tart to sexually powerful woman. Had Britney been in charge of her career direction instead of mercilessly prostituted by her management, she might have been able to produce something with some semblance of musical vision.&quot;;; ''The Guardian'' praised the album's melodies and her effort, giving it 4 out of 5 stars and writing, &quot;Unlike previous Britney albums, ''In the Zone'' has no filler and no shoddy cover versions, just 57 varieties of blue-chip hit-factory pop. There is southern hip-hop, deep house, Neptunes-style R&amp;B, the ubiquitous Diwali beat and, most importantly, oodles of Madonna.&quot;;; 

The album spawned the international #1 single &quot;Toxic&quot;, winning Spears her first ever Grammy in the category of Best Dance Recording.; &quot;The Onyx Hotel Tour&quot; began in March 2004 to promote the album. The tour's raunchy choreography generated much controversy and heavy criticisms, with the presence of young children the audience.;;

=2004&amp;ndash;2005: Greatest Hits and Remix album=









After her marriage to Kevin Federline, Spears announced on her website she was taking another career break in order to start a family.;;November 2004 saw the release of her first greatest hits collection, ''Greatest Hits: My Prerogative''. The album debuted at #4 on the U.S. charts and featured her version of Bobby Brown's 1988 hit &quot;My Prerogative&quot;. The compilation did not include the single &quot;From the Bottom of My Broken Heart&quot;.;; 

In November 2005, Spears released her first remix album, ''B In The Mix: The Remixes''. The album ranged from &quot;...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time&quot; to &quot;Toxic&quot;. Her newest single &quot;Someday (I Will Understand)&quot; was also remixed. Another single, &quot;And Then We Kiss&quot;, was only released in Asia, where it charted in many countries. The song peaked at #15 on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart,;; despite it not being officially released in the U.S. With Spears still on maternity leave, the album did not reach the success of her previous albums.;;

=2007: Music return=


Spears recorded her latest album with producers such as Sean Garrett, J. R. Rotem and Nate &quot;Danja&quot; Hills in 2006 and 2007.;;;;In May 2007, she produced a mini-tour for the House of Blues under the name &quot;The M+M's Tour|The M+M's&quot;, with 6 shows althogether. Spears did not sing live in the 15-minute shows.;;;; 

Spears's fifth album entitled ''Blackout'', was scheduled to be released November 2007.; Due to online leaks, the album was pushed up for release on October 30.;; ''Blackout'' debuted at #2 on the US Billboard 200 charts, selling 290,000 copies.;; It received decent reception from critics. ''Rolling Stone'' gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, stating that &quot;''Blackout'' is the first time in her career that she's voiced any real thoughts about her life. The old provocation game is still afoot, but Britney's stubbornly holding on to her freakness — it's the only form of rebellion she's got left.&quot;;; ''All Music Guide'' also rated the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, noting that &quot;''Blackout'' is an easy album to overpraise based on the lowered expectations Britney's behavior has set for her audience, as none of her antics suggested that she'd be able to deliver something coherent and entertaining&quot; and also that &quot;it holds together better than any of her other records, echoing the sleek club-centric feel of ''In the Zone'' but it's heavier on hedonism than its predecessor, stripped of any ballads or sensitivity, and just reveling in dirty good times.&quot;;;








The album's first single &quot;Gimme More&quot; was her first produced by Danja, it debuted worldwide on August 30.;; The track peaked at number three on ''Billboard's'' Hot 100 on October 3, becoming Spears's most successful single in the United States since her debut, &quot;...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time&quot;.;;;; 

Spears's performance at 2007 MTV Video Music Awards received much media attention and was called a disappointing attempt at a &quot;comeback&quot;.;;;;;; She performed &quot;Gimme More&quot;, the lead single from her ''Blackout'' album. Reviews of the performance were unfavorable; BBC's David Willis stated that &quot;her performance would go down in the history books as being one of the worst to grace the MTV Awards,&quot;;; and ''The Times'' noted that &quot;Spears was out of synch as she lip-synched and at times just stopped singing altogether.&quot;;; Despite the VMA backlash, the single has achieved success worldwide.;;;;;;
