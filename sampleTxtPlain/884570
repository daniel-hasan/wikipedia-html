 is a console role-playing game developed and published by Square Enix for the Sony PlayStation 2 video game console, and the twelfth installment in the ''Final Fantasy'' video game series. It was released in 2006, and was the first single player ''Final Fantasy'' title of the main series since ''Final Fantasy X'' five years earlier.;; Selling more than two million copies in Japan,;; it became the fourth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of 2006 worldwide.;;

The game takes place in the fictional location called Ivalice, where the empires of Archadia and Rozarria are waging an endless war. Dalmasca, a small kingdom, is caught between the warring nations. When Archadia invades and occupies Dalmasca, its princess, Ashe, creates a resistance movement. During the struggle, she meets Vaan, a young adventurer who dreams of commanding an airship. They are quickly joined by a band of allies; together, they rally against the tyranny of the Archadian Empire.

''Final Fantasy XII'' introduced several innovations to the series: battles occur without a transition to a separate screen; a &quot;gambit&quot; system automatically controls the actions of characters; and a &quot;license&quot; system determines which abilities and equipment are used by characters.;;;; ''Final Fantasy XII'' also includes elements from previous games in the series, such as Final Fantasy magic#Summoning Magic|summoned monsters,; Chocobos,;; and airships.; The game received universally high scores, and earned numerous &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards in various categories from noted video game publications. The sequel, ''Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings'', was released for the Nintendo DS on April 26 2007 in Japan and was released in North America on November 20 2007.;;;;

Gameplay
Throughout the game, the player directly controls the onscreen character from a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies. Unlike previous games in the series, the player can also control the camera with the right analog stick, allowing for a 360° view of the surroundings.;; While in towns and cities, the player may only see from the perspective of Vaan, although any character may be controlled in battle. The world of ''Final Fantasy XII'' is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the world by foot, by Chocobo,; or by airship.; Players may save their game to a memory card using save crystals and may also teleport between special gate crystals.;; An in-game bestiary provides incidental information about the world of ''Final Fantasy XII''.;;

''Final Fantasy XII'' largely reforms the system of earning Final Fantasy items#Currency|gil, the currency of the ''Final Fantasy'' games. Instead of gil, most enemies drop &quot;loot&quot;, which can be sold at shops.;; This ties into a new battle mechanic which rewards the player with improved loot for slaying a particular type of monster multiple times in a row.;; Selling different types of loot also unlocks a Bazaar option in shops, which provides items at a lower cost, or items exclusive to the Bazaar.;

=Battle system=
A standard battle; blue lines depict the player's targets and red lines depict those of the enemies.
Unlike the previous ''Final Fantasy'' games which used a turn-based system, battles in ''Final Fantasy XII'' occur in the open field, however menus are still used to issue commands to the characters. Combat unfolds in real time, using a new system called ''Square Enix battle systems#Real Time Battle|active dimension battle'' (ADB), which allows the player to battle in the overworld instead of in a separate battle screen.;; The player may issue commands to any of the three characters in the battle party at will or allow &quot;gambits&quot;, which issue automatic commands under certain triggers, to allow the characters to act on their own; however, certain &quot;guest&quot; characters are controlled by the game's AI.;; Battle commands include ''Attack'', ''Magicks &amp; Technicks'', ''Mist'', ''Gambits'', and ''Items''. Using these abilities, the player must destroy enemies before being defeated.

&quot;Random encounters&quot; have been eliminated in ''Final Fantasy XII''; the transition to a separate battle screen like in other ''Final Fantasy'' titles is absent.; Instead, enemies are visible in the overworld before an engagement and the player may choose to fight or avoid them in open combat. A battle begins when the party comes within range of an aggressive enemy (or vice versa), if the party attacks a nonaggressive enemy, or if a story event initiates a confrontation.; When a character or enemy begins to perform an action, target lines connect characters to other party members or enemies; different colors represent the type of action.;; The player may switch any active character with an inactive character at any time, unless the active character is targeted by an attack or ability. Characters who are knocked out may also be substituted. The absence of a transition to a battle screen meant the usual victory scene is also eliminated, though a successful &quot;Boss&quot; battle does present the player with a &quot;Congratulations&quot; screen and the participating characters in their victory poses.;;

Another new feature in ''Final Fantasy XII'' is the &quot;gambit&quot; system, which allows the player to program each character to perform certain commands in battle in response to specified conditions.;; Using gambits, the player may set reactions to different stimuli for each character. Each gambit consists of three parts: a target, an action, and a priority. The target specifies which ally or foe to act on and the condition for applying the action. For example, the target &quot;Ally: HP ;

Espers, such as Mateus, pictured, aid in battle.
In ''Final Fantasy XII'', a mysterious phenomenon, &quot;Mist&quot;, is the key energy which allows the player to Final Fantasy magic#Summoning Magic|cast summoning magic and perform &quot;Quickenings&quot;, the game's version of Limit Breaks. After defeating one in combat, the player will be able to summon an &quot;Esper&quot; to the battlefield.;; Similar to ''Final Fantasy X'', the summoned creatures become active participants in battle,; as opposed to the cinematic attacks seen in previous games in the series. Unlike ''Final Fantasy X'', however, Espers follow hidden gambits, rather than the player's direct command.; The summoner remains an active member in the fight, able to attack and cast support magic, instead of leaving the party or standing idle while the summoned creature fights.; An Esper will leave the battle if either the summoner or itself is knocked out, its time limit expires, or it executes its special attack.; Some Espers have origins in the two installments of the ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' series and others are derived from the final bosses of previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, such as Chaos and Characters of Final Fantasy IV#Major villains|Zeromus.

''Final Fantasy XII'' introduces a new Limit Break system similar to those in previous games in the series: &quot;Quickenings&quot; (&quot;Mist Knacks&quot; in the Japanese version of the game).;; Characters learn Quickenings by progressing to specific panels on the License Board.; Each character can learn three Quickenings, which are unique to that character.; Characters may string together Quickenings into large combo attacks, called Mist Chains.; If a Mist Chain reaches a certain number of attacks, a final strike will be initiated at the end of the Quickening cycle, called a Concurrence.;

=License Board=
The License Board; raised panels indicate acquired licenses.
Like most role-playing games, characters experience point#Level-based progression|level up each time they earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies; each &quot;level&quot; gained increases the character's Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics, thus improving their performance in battle.;; Statistics include hit points, the amount of damage a character can receive; strength, the power of the character's physical attacks; and magic, the potency of the character's magical spells.;

In addition to leveling up, players may improve their characters via the License Board. The License Board is an oddly shaped array of panels that contain &quot;licenses&quot;—permits which allow a character to perform certain actions.;; The board is split into two parts; the upper part contains Magick, Technick, Accessory, and Augment (stat-raising) licenses, and the bottom part is filled mostly with Weapon and Armor licenses.;; To use an statistic (role-playing games)#Skills|ability or piece of equipment, the character must obtain its corresponding license by spending the required amount of LP (License Points) to permit its use.; LP are earned in battle along with the experience points. Like ''Final Fantasy Xs Final Fantasy X#Sphere Grid|Sphere Grid, all characters may obtain all licenses on the board; however, each Quickening and Esper license may only be activated by a single character.;;

''Final Fantasy XII'' is set within the land of Ivalice during an age when &quot;magic was commonplace&quot; and &quot;airships plied the skies, crowding out the heavens&quot;. At this time, magicite, a magic-rich mineral, is commonly used in magic spells;Sage Knowledge 12 of 78 (Hybrid Gator Bestiary entry) Magicite - Common name for stones containing magickal power, or as it is commonly manifest, Mist. ; and in powering airships—a popular form of transportation in Ivalice.;Sage Knowledge 14 of 78 (Steeling Bestiary entry) Airships - Currently, they are one of the most popular forms of transportation in Ivalice. ; Ivalice is divided into three continents:; Sage Knowledge 29 of 78 (Sleipnir Bestiary entry);Ivalice - The region consisting of the three continents of Valendia, Ordalia, and Kerwon, blessed throughout with verdant natural landscapes and climatic conditions supporting a great variety of life. ; Ordalia, Valendia, and Kerwon.;; Ordalia is located in the western part of Ivalice. The Rozarrian Empire makes its home in the vast inland plains of this continent as the eastern portion of it is largely desert or &quot;jagd&quot;—lawless lands so rich in Mist (the ethereal manifestation of magicite) that airships cannot fly over them.;Sage Knowledge 30 of 78 (Urstrix Bestiary entry) Ordalia - Continent on the western edge of Ivalice. The vast plains in the interior are home to the great Rozarrian Empire. To the east of Rozarria, the land is arid and largely desert. ; Valendia is the home of Imperial Archadia, where vast and lush plains dot the landscape.;; Central to the story is Dalmasca, a small kingdom between the two continents and Empires. Located in the middle of the Galtean Peninsula of Ordalia, Dalmasca is surrounded by an expanse of desert. The temperate climate of Dalmasca differs from the cold environs of Kerwon and the lush plains of Valendia and Ordalia.;; During this time, Ivalice is beset by the pending war between the forces of Rozarria and Archadia. Caught between the two powerful Empires, Dalmasca and a number of smaller nations have already been subjugated by Archadia two years before the game begins.

According to the game developers, design inspiration came from a mix of medieval Mediterranean countries as demonstrated by the architectural styles found throughout Ivalice along with many of the races populating the region.;; The art team visited Turkey, which influenced the game’s Mediterranean-style setting.;; The developers also used styles and deco from other sources including areas in India and New York City.;;; Of note is the use of Sanskrit in the city of Ivalice#Purvama Dorstonis|Bhujerba. Phrases such as &quot;Svagatam&quot; (welcome) and titles like &quot;Parijanah&quot; (Guide) are lifted directly from Sanskrit. Hideo Minaba, a developer and co-art director with Isamu Kamikokuryō, mentions that the team tried to bring out Arabic culture in the design of the game.;; War is a predominant theme of the game and the developers confirmed that the cutscene battles are influenced by Ancient Rome.; When asked to comment on the fan observation of ''Star Wars'' influence, Minaba assured that although he was a fan of the ''Star Wars'' series, it was not necessarily an influence to the game's designs.;

=Characters=

Cast of Final Fantasy XII
The six main playable characters in ''Final Fantasy XII'' are Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Vaan|Vaan, an energetic orphan of Rabanastre who dreams of becoming a sky pirate; Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca|Ashe, a determined princess of Dalmasca who lost her husband in the Archadian invasion; Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Basch fon Ronsenburg|Basch, a disgraced knight of Dalmasca charged with treason for slaying the king; Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Balthier|Balthier, a gentlemanly sky pirate who pilots his airship, the ''Strahl''; Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Fran|Fran, Balthier's partner and a Viera exile whose knowledge extends to legends and myths; and Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Penelo|Penelo, Vaan's childhood friend who accompanies him in journeys to keep an eye over him.;;

The Archadian Empire is ruled by House Solidor, headed by Emperor Gramis.;; The family also consists of two siblings, Vayne and Larsa, the former a militaristic genius and the latter a charismatic seeker of peace. Judge Magisters, upholders of Archadian law,; protect House Solidor and execute every command and order issued by the ruling family. The technological marvels of airships and synthetic nethicite—a form of magicite that absorbs Mist—are thanks to Dr. Cid, a prominent researcher from Archadia.; The Resistance against Archadia includes Dalmascan knight Vossler, an ally of Basch; Marquis Halim Ondore IV, the game's narrator and ruler of the skycity Bhujerba; Reddas, a sky pirate based in the port at Balfonheim; and the Rozarrian Empire, of which Al-Cid Margrace is a prince of the ruling family.; The mythos of ''Final Fantasy XII'' revolves around a character known as Dynast-King Raithwall, the man who once united Ivalice to create the Galtean Alliance.

Basch was initially meant to be the main character of the story, but the focus was eventually shifted to Vaan and Penelo when the two characters were created later in development.; The development team explained that their previous game, ''Vagrant Story'', which featured a &quot;strong man in his prime&quot; as the protagonist had been unsuccessful and unpopular; the change regarding ''Final Fantasy XII'' from a &quot;big and tough&quot; protagonist to a more effeminate one was thus decided after targeting demographics were considered. With the casting of dorama actor :ja:武田航平|Kouhei Takeda for the voice acting and motion capture, Vaan nevertheless became a little less feminine and more &quot;active, upbeat bright and positive&quot; than planned.;;;; Comments were made about the similarity between main character designer and background design supervisor Akihiko Yoshida's creations and those of Tetsuya Nomura, another Square Enix character designer. Yoshida feels this connection is sparked by the style of color used by both artists, which involves a color consistency between the characters and the environments.; The designers stated that non-human characters and races feature a prominent role in the game,; which was influenced by an interest in history among the developers.;

=Story=
''Final Fantasy XII''begins in Dalmasca's capital city of Rabanastre, where the happiness from the union of Princess Ashe of Dalmasca and Prince Rasler of Nabradia is interrupted by the Archadian Empire's invasion of Dalmasca. In the subsequent war, Nabradia and Dalmasca are subjugated by Archadia; among the lives lost is Prince Rasler. The Dalmascan king, Raminas, who is forced to sign a treaty of surrender, is slated to be assassinated.;Ondore: The King had scarce departed His Royal City of Rabanastre when the Remnants of the Order made their Return. And not a Moment too soon, for a terrible Revelation awaited them. The Treaty would be signed with Steel and Writ in royal Blood. ; A rescue attempt by Dalmascan knights backfires when Basch, one of the leading knights, kills Raminas and Reks, a young 17-year old knight who was with the knights during the attempt. The treason of Basch, and Ashe's eventual suicide, are announced by Marquis Ondore.;Ondore: Prayer, too, for the noble Princess Ashe, who, wrought with Grief at her Kingdom’s Defeat, has taken her own Life. Know also that Capt. Basch fon Ronsenburg, for Incitement of Sedition and the Assassination of H.R.M. King Raminas, has been found Guilty of High Treason and put to his Death. ;

Two years later, Vaan, Reks's younger brother, infiltrates the Rabanastre palace during the dinner to celebrate the appointment of Vayne as Consul, despite Penelo's objection. During the infiltration, Vaan encounters Balthier and Fran, who introduce him to magicite. Their escape attempt backfires when Resistance forces storm the palace, landing them into the sewers where they stumble upon the Resistance leader, Amalia. However, Vaan, Balthier and Fran are captured by the Archadians and detained at the Nalbina Dungeons. In Nalbina, the trio encounters Basch and escapes with him, after learning of the existence of his twin, Judge Magister Gabranth. Basch conveys to Vaan that Gabranth had posed as him to blackmail Ondore.;Basch: Just the opposite. Reks was the witness they needed. They had to make it appear as if I’d killed the King—Reks bears no blame. The Fates have willed it. ; While skeptical at first, Vaan finally believes him,;Vaan: You don’t have to keep apologizing. Really, it’s all right. I know it wasn’t your fault. I see that now. You didn’t kill my brother. It was the Empire. My brother trusted you. And he was right. ; and helps Basch reach Bhujerba with the help of Balthier and Fran. They also learn of Penelo's kidnapping by headhunter Ba'Gamnan, who uses her to lure Balthier to him. This brings them to a meeting in Bhujerba with Lamont, a curious boy who is in truth Vayne's younger brother, Larsa.;Larsa: Vayne Solidor, the Consul, is my brother ... My brother is a remarkable man. ; Basch is also able to confront the Marquis, who captures the party to be sent onboard the Archadian airship, Leviathan, headed by Judge Ghis. Ghis takes Vaan's magicite - the Dusk Shard - to be sent to Archadia.

On the Leviathan, the party is reunited with Amalia, revealed to be Princess Ashe;;Ghis: Come now, come now. Have you forgotten your manners? This is hardly the courtesy due... The late Princess Ashelia B’nargin Dalmasca. ; and Penelo, who had been rescued by Larsa. Escaping the airship and unable to convince the Marquis to prove her royal lineage,;Ondore: You may yet be a Princess, but without proof of your identity, you are powerless. You will remain with me. We do nothing till the time is right. ; Ashe, driven by visions of Rasler, attempts to collect the Dynast-King Raithwall's treasures to prove her royal blood.;Ashe: Rasler... you will be avenged. ;;Ashe: I’m going to retrieve the Dawn Shard. It’s the proof that I need. I know where it’s hidden. I’ll return his airship later. ; The Dawn Shard, a form of magicite called deifacted Nethicite obtained from Raithwall's Tomb and seized by Ghis, proves to be fatal as the small stone destroys the Leviathan, Ghis, and his fleet. Now unable to use the Shard, Larsa convinces Ashe to seek Gran Kiltias Anastasis, who lives in Mt. Bur-Omisace, for his approval of her as queen of Dalmasca.;Larsa: Lady Ashe, let us go to Bur-Omisace. With the blessing of His Grace the Gran Kiltias Anastasis... you may rightly wear your crown, and declare the restoration of the Kingdom of Dalmasca. As Queen, you can call for peace between the Empire and Dalmasca...and stop Marquis Ondore. ; Vaan and Penelo travel with the entourage, which includes Basch, Balthier, and Fran. On the way, the party rescues Fran's sister, Mjrn, who was possessed by manufacted (artificial) Nethicite in the process.

The party learns in Mt. Bur-Omisace that not all parties are wishing for war.;Anastasis: In Archadia, Larsa. In Rozarria, Al-Cid. They dream not of war. Should empire join with empire, the way will open for a new Ivalice in our time. ; Larsa, who had been investigating Vayne's connection with the manufacted Nethicite,;Larsa: Dalmasca would be the battlefield! What if Nethicite were used on Rabanastre? You know my brother would do this! ; had made contact with Al-Cid Margrace, a member of the Rozarrian Empire ruling family, to convince the two Empires to cease their war. Their plan to announce Ashe's status as Dalmascan Queen and to persuade Gramis for peace was forestalled with the Emperor's death at the supposed hands of the Archadian Senate Chairman, Gregoroth.;Al-Cid: The Emperor Gramis is no more. His life was taken. ;;Drace: A viper amongst our Senators!? / Vayne: With Chairman Gregoroth as its head. He confessed and passed his own sentence.; With Anastasis' aid, Ashe retrieves the Sword of Kings, which can destroy Nethicite. While she obtains the sword, Anastasis is killed by Judge Bergan and Larsa is brought back to Archadia. After defeating Judge Bergan, Ashe's party travels to Archades and the Draklor Laboratory, where manufacted Nethicite were made by Dr. Cid's research. There, they encounter Reddas; however, Dr. Cid escapes and leaves clues that lead them to Giruvegan,;Cid: Am I right? I am, aren’t I. A worthy daughter of the Dynast-King! You would do well to go to Giruvegan. Who knows? You may receive a new Stone for your trouble. ; the supposed location of the Sun-Cryst, the source of deifacted Nethicite.;Gerun: Seek you the Sun-cryst, slumb'ring star. In tower on distant shore it dreams. The mother of all Nethicite, the source of its unending power. ; While together able to enter Giruvegan, Ashe alone encounters the makers of the Sun-Cryst, the Occuria, receiving the real location of the Sun-Cryst, and the Treaty Blade to cut her own piece of deifacted Nethicite.;Gerun: Now take this sword, this Treaty-Blade. Occurian seal, mark of your worth. Cut deep the Cryst and seize your Shards. Wield Dynast-King's power! Destroy Venat! ;

The Archadian Empire's might, led by Vayne, was due to Dr. Cid's Nethicite research and the assistance of the Occuria betrayer, Venat.;Venat: Indeed. What claim does Gerun have on history's reins…seated on throne immortal, rent from time? ; Vayne aims to become the new Dynast-King by using manufacted Nethicite to conquer all of Ivalice.;Bergan: Hark! Ivalice hails her true Dynast-King, Vayne Solidor! He shall defy the will of the gods, and see the reins of History back in the hands of Man! ; Dr. Cid, revealed to be Balthier's father, was obsessed with researching the Nethicite's power after his own visit to Giruvegan and initial encounter with Venat.;Balthier: He was obsessed with Nethicite... He’d babble nonsense, blind to aught but the Stone’s power. He’d talk about some ‘Eynah,’ or was it ‘Venat’?...That’s when he lost his heart to Nethicite, lost himself. And I suppose that’s when I lost my father. ; Their expansion campaign which led to the Nabudis' destruction and Dalmasca's occupation was made to obtain and study the royal heirlooms - deifacted Nethicite.;Vayne: We conquered two kingdoms, that you might study these &quot;baubles&quot;. / Cid: Oh, I am grateful for the sacrifice. Without it, Manufacted Nethicite would have eluded us—an unrivaled weapon, I warrant you. ; Gabranth was sent to Giruvegan to ascertain Ashe's intentions for war. With the Occuria's clue to the Sun-Cryst, Ashe travels to the Pharos at Ridorana Cataract, accompanied by Reddas. Finding the Sun-Cryst atop the tower, Ashe resolves to destroy the Sun-Cryst,;Ashe: In all Dalmasca's history, not once did we rely on the Dusk Shard. Our people resolved never to use it, though their need might be dire. That was the Dalmasca I wanted back... I will destroy the Sun-cryst! I will discard the Stone! ; defeating Gabranth, who admits to killing her father in an attempt to force her to give in to her hate.;Gabranth: Yes, it was I who wore Basch’s face- who cut down the Life of Dalmasca. Lady Ashe! Your father's murderer is here! ; By then, Cid arrives to chide Gabranth before disposing of him and evoking the full-power of the Sun-Cryst with the Nethicite shards prior to his death. Reddas, intent not to allow history repeat itself like at Nabudis, sacrifices himself to destroy it using the Sword of Kings.;Reddas: ...2 years past, he took the Midlight Shard and used it not knowing what he did... and Nabudis was blown away. Cid ordered this of him to learn the Nethicite’s true power. That man swore never to let such terrible power be used again. He forsook his Judicer's plate, and his name. / Gabranth: Judge Zecht! ;

Ashe learns from Al-Cid that an impending war between Archadia and the Resistance group led by Marquis Ondore, who defied the Empire after the Leviathan incident,;Reddas: The time approaches when he must make his position vis-à-vis the Empire clear. When he helped you off the Leviathan, he spited the Judges full sore. He cannot sit in idleness and expect to avoid a reckoning. The Marquis shares my distaste for war... ; is about to take place in Rabanastre. The party travels home to find Archadian forces strengthened with the Sky Fortress Bahamut - an enormous, nethicite-fuelled airship armed with incredibly powerful weapons. Infiltrating the sky fortress with the aid of the Resistance, Basch confronts Gabranth, who spews hate towards his twin, yet taken by Basch's loyalty.;Gabranth: You confound me, brother! You failed Landis, you failed Dalmasca... all you were to protect. Yet you still hold on to your honor. How? / Basch: I had someone more important to defend. And defend her I have. How is it that you have survived? Is it not because you defend Lord Larsa? ; The party encounters Vayne and Larsa, the latter objecting to Vayne's plot for power;;Vayne: Observe well, Larsa. Watch and mark you the suffering of one who must rule, yet lacks the power. / Larsa: No. No, brother. I will not. Though I lack your power, I will still persist.; Larsa and Gabranth ally with the party to destroy Vayne after Venat infused its power into him. The war ends with an announcement by Ashe,;Ashe: This is Ashelia Dalmasca. I confirm what Judge Magister Gabranth and Larsa Solidor have said here. Please. Stand down your attack. The war is over. Ivalice looks to the horizon. A new day has dawned. We are free! ; and with Larsa taking over the Imperial Army.;Larsa: Attention. This is Larsa Ferrinas Solidor. My brother Vayne has died with honor in battle. The Imperial Fleet is now under my command! ; The party escapes Bahamut, now void of its fuel due to the final battle, with Larsa and the body of Gabranth. Balthier and Fran remain onboard the Bahamut, steering it away from Rabanastre to prevent a collision, though contact with them was lost.

One year later, Ashe has become Queen of Dalmasca and her coronation is about to take place in one month's time; Basch replaces Gabranth as Judge Magister due to the latter's request,;Gabranth: Basch. Look after Larsa, will you? If house Solidor should crumble, the Empire would fail, and civil war would take us all. ; serving as guardian to Larsa, now Emperor of Archadia. The story ends with Vaan flying his own airship with Penelo after Balthier and Fran return to 'steal' the Strahl. They leave Vaan a message which includes a note to Queen Ashe and also her ring that Balthier took from her earlier in the story, this is then delivered to Ashe. Following this, Vaan and Penelo set out in an airship to visit Balthier and Fran in Ivalice#Final Fantasy Tactics|Bervenia.;Balthier's note: Something more valuable: the Cache of Glabados. I await in Bervenia.;

Development
;
Development for ''Final Fantasy XII'' began in 2001.;; ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' creator Yasumi Matsuno, originally announced as producer and director, was forced to bow out of both roles midway through the creation of ''Final Fantasy XII'' due to health concerns.;; In his place, Hiroyuki Itō and Hiroshi Minagawa took over directorial duties while Akitoshi Kawazu, of ''SaGa'' series fame, became the executive producer with Square Enix president Yōichi Wada.;;;;Matsuno's departure was regretted by series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who declined to play ''Final Fantasy XII'' beyond the introduction.;;

The gambit screen can change how a character will act in different scenarios.
The desire to move away from random encounters was present since the beginning of development.;Interview with Hiroyuki Itō; This desire fueled the transition to the &quot;active dimension battle&quot; system so players could seamlessly move from battle to exploration. The gambit system was conceived early on as a way to facilitate this transition.; Battle system designer Hiroshi Tomomatsu states that it gradually moved away from a complex and rigid formula to the more flexible form seen in the final version of the game.;Interview with Hiroshi Tomomatsu; Itō drew inspiration for gambits from plays in American football where each team member has a specific job to do based on the conditions and desired outcome. As for the License system, he explained that needing &quot;licenses&quot; to perform certain actions was a natural extension of the rigid structured society of Archadia, as epitomized by its Judges.; 

At the early stages of development, Minagawa revealed that numerous ideas and features were planned for the game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included the ability for a second player to join in the gameplay, enabling for a two-player mode. Another idea that was given a considerable amount of thought was the ability to recruit non-player characters to join in the mob hunts. Due to the physical limitations of the console and multiple number of characters joining the fray, the development phase took longer than expected, causing delays.;;

On November 15, 2005, a playable demo of the game was shipped with the North American release of ''Dragon Quest VIII''.;; To commemorate the release of ''Final Fantasy XII'', playable demos of the English version were available at DigitalLife's Gaming Pavilion in New York on October 11, 2006, a day dubbed &quot;''Final Fantasy XII'' Gamer's Day&quot;.;; Additionally, Square Enix gave fans the chance to cosplay as a character from ''Final Fantasy XII''. Each person was asked to show Square Enix three photos of his or her costume for a chance to win a trip to New York and participate in the ''Final Fantasy XII'' Gamer's Day event.;;

During the English localization process, Alexander O. Smith, who had previously worked on ''Vagrant Story'' and ''Final Fantasy X'', acted as producer and translator.; While still preserving the meaning behind the Japanese script written by Daisuke Watanabe and Miwa Shoda, Smith made the decision to use different dialects of English to reproduce the regional differences in pronunciation found in the Japanese version.;;;Interview with Alexander O. Smith; He also tried to distance the game from the &quot;flat reads&quot; found in other dubbed work by casting voice actors who had experience in theater work.; In terms of general changes, the localization team introduced widescreen 16:9 ratio support and reinserted scenes that were left out of the original Japanese version to preserve an &quot;All Ages&quot; CERO rating.;;

Audio

Hitoshi Sakimoto composed most of the game's soundtrack; Nobuo Uematsu, following his departure from Square Enix in 2004, only contributed the theme song.;; Sakimoto experienced difficulty following in Uematsu's footsteps, but he decided to create a unique soundtrack in his own way.;Interview with Hitoshi Sakimoto;;; &quot;Kiss Me Good-Bye&quot;, the theme song for ''Final Fantasy XII'', was performed in both English and Japanese by Angela Aki.;; Uematsu noted that Aki's style of playing the keyboard while singing reminded him of his childhood idol, Elton John, which was one of the reasons he chose her.;; The English version of the song was featured in both the Japanese and North American versions of the game.
