The ''Aviation navale'' (Naval aviation) of the French Navy includes 162 airplanes (138 of them combat-capable) and 6,800 men, both civilians and military personnel. They operate from six airbases, 5 of them in Metropolitan France and one overseas.

Born as a fusion of carrier squadrons and naval patrol air force, the ''Aviation navale'' was created on the 19 June 1998. The headquarter is under command of an admiral (ALAVIA) in Toulon.

It has four components:
* The air complements of the aircraft carrier ''Charles de Gaulle'': Rafale, Dassault Super Étendard|Super Étendard and E-2 Hawkeye
* Naval patrol air units: Breguet Atlantique
* On-board helicopters: Dauphin, Panther, Aérospatiale Super Frelon|Super Frelon, Lynx, Aérospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III
* Support air units

Carrier-borne pilots of the French navy do their initial training at Salon-de-Provence Air Base, then within the US Navy.
