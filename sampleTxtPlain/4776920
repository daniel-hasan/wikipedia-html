Seven hold-over episodes from the season 16 (GABF) production line, were aired as part of this season. One of these episodes, &quot;The Girl Who Slept Too Little&quot;, was intended to air as the season 16 finale on May 15, 2005, but after &quot;The Father, The Son, and The Holy Guest Star&quot;, an episode satirizing the Catholic Church, was postponed due to Pope John Paul II's death, it was moved into this season.;; 

&quot;The Seemingly Never-Ending Story&quot; won an Emmy for Outstanding Animated Series, the first ''Simpsons'' episode to win since season 14's &quot;Three Gays of the Condo&quot; and the ninth time in the history of the show.;; Kelsey Grammer received the Emmy for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for &quot;The Italian Bob&quot;.;;
