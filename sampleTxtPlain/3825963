''Dreamgirls''is a 2006 American musical film jointly produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures and Paramount Pictures. The film debuted in three special road show engagements beginning December 15, 2006, with a nationwide release on December 25, 2006 and a home video release on May 1, 2007. ''Dreamgirls'' won three awards at the 64th Golden Globe Awards ceremony in 2007, including Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy|Best Picture - Musical or Comedy, and won two Oscars at the 79th Academy Awards.

A period piece set in the 1960s and 1970s with a primarily African-American cast, ''Dreamgirls'' is adapted from the 1981 Broadway musical of the same name. The musical was based on the history and evolution of American R&amp;B music during the eras of doo-wop, soul, the Motown Sound, funk, and disco. In addition, the stage musical contains several allusions to the lives and careers of Motown Records act The Supremes, a connection the film version expands upon.;(Feb 2, 2007). &quot;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2003605,00.html I literally pinch myself every day].&quot; ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 2007-02-27.; ''Dreamgirls'' follows the lives of Effie White, Deena Jones, and Lorrell Robinson, three young women who form an R&amp;B singing trio from Detroit, Michigan called &quot;The Dreamettes&quot;.Thanks to manipulative agent and record executive Curtis Taylor, Jr., the Dreamettes become famous as the backing group for soul singer James &quot;Thunder&quot; Early. Conflict arises when Curtis transforms &quot;The Dreamettes&quot; into the pop-friendly &quot;Dreams,&quot; particularly when he has Deena replace Effie as both lead singer of the group and as his romantic interest.

The film adaptation of ''Dreamgirls'', which had been in development at various times during the 1980s and 1990s, stars Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé Knowles, and Eddie Murphy. The film also features Danny Glover, Jennifer Hudson, Anika Noni Rose, Keith Robinson, Sharon Leal, and Hinton Battle. Produced by Laurence Mark, ''Dreamgirls'' was written and directed for the screen by Bill Condon, screenwriter of the Academy Award-winning film adaptation of ''Chicago'', working from the original Broadway book by Tom Eyen and the Broadway songs by Eyen and Henry Krieger. Four new songs, composed by Krieger with various lyricists, were added for this film. Jennifer Hudson won the 2007 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Effie White.

Plot summary

As in the original stage musical, ''Dreamgirls'' is broken up into two acts: the first taking place from 1962 to 1965, and the second taking place from 1973 to 1975.

=Act I=
The film begins in Detroit, Michigan in 1962, as an amateur Black girl group known as The Dreamettes enter a talent competition at the Detroit Theater. Backstage, the three girls — full-figured lead singer Effie White (Jennifer Hudson), Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles) and Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose) — meet Curtis Taylor, Jr., an ambitious Cadillac dealer with plans of breaking into the music business. Placing himself as their manager, Curtis arranges for the Dreamettes to tour as backup for a regional R&amp;B star, James &quot;Thunder&quot; Early (Eddie Murphy). The tour takes the company - also including Effie's songwriting brother C.C. (Keith Robinson) and Jimmy's manager Marty (Danny Glover) - across the country on the chitlin' circuit.

Hoping to help Jimmy and the girls cross over to mainstream audiences, Curtis starts his own record label, Rainbow Records (&quot;The Sound of Tomorrow&quot;), out of his car dealership's office, and makes C.C. his head songwriter. However, when Rainbow's first single fails after a white pop group releases a cover version, Curtis and his sidekick Wayne (Hinton Battle) turn to payola. By paying the right people, Curtis manages to get Jimmy and the Dreamettes to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 and into a headlining gig at the Apollo Theater. Offstage, Effie is quickly becoming infatuated with the slick-talking Curtis, and Jimmy - a married man - begins an adulterous affair with Lorrell, who becomes equally as lovesick as Effie.

Marty grows weary of Curtis' plans to make Jimmy's image and sound more pop-friendly, to the point that he walks out on Jimmy, both his client and best friend. However, when Curtis finds that he cannot completely remake Jimmy Early into a pop act, he shifts his attention back to the Dreamettes. Feeling that Effie's voice is too &quot;special&quot; and her figure too large to attract white audiences, Curtis appoints the slimmer Deena as the lead singer of the Dreamettes.

With the aid of new songs and a new more glamorous image, Curtis and C.C. transform The Dreamettes into The Dreams, a top selling pop act whose popularity comes to rival that of The Beatles by 1965. However, the betrayed Effie does not take kindly to being reduced to Deena's backup, and begins acting out, becoming even more unruly when Curtis's affections also turn towards Deena. When Effie, feeling ill, does not turn up to rehearse for the Dreams' debut in Las Vegas, Curtis replaces Effie with his secretary, Michelle Morris (Sharon Leal). Effie, who has just learned she is pregnant, arrives at the Caesar's Palace venue just as Michelle does, and after a nearly violent argument, finds herself without her group and without Curtis.



=Act II=
Eight years later, Effie is a depressed welfare mother, and her career in music is over due to alcoholism. She and her seven-year-old daughter Magic (Mariah I. Wilson) live alone in the burnt-out inner city of 1973 Detroit with only Effie's father Ronald (Alexander Folk) to look in on them. On the other hand, Rainbow Records has moved to Los Angeles where it prospers with Deena Jones &amp; the Dreams and many other pop acts. Wanting to expand his empire into film, Curtis plans to have an unwilling Deena, now his wife, star in a blaxploitation musical version of ''Cleopatra''. Hoping that the struggling film project will never get off the ground, Deena begins secretly meeting with other studios to take a part in another film.

Though still part of the Rainbow roster, Jimmy Early's stardom has long faded, and Curtis has little interest in revitalizing his career. Unsatisfied with both his wife Melba (Dawnn Lewis) and his long-term mistress Lorrell, Jimmy turns to drugs for affection. Meanwhile, C.C. continues to reach out to Effie, who stubbornly ignores the letters and money he sends. Eventually, Effie swallows her pride and, with Marty as her manager, returns to singing and secures gigs at a small Detroit club.

In 1974, Rainbow Records hosts a tenth anniversary TV special. Midway through his set, Jimmy decides that he cannot sing any more pop numbers, so he breaks down onstage and launches into a wild James Brown-type funk number, dropping his pants on live TV. Curtis resultantly terminates Jimmy's contract, and Lorrell, weary of their eight-year affair, leaves Jimmy behind as well. Some time later, Jimmy dies of a heroin overdose.

By 1975, C.C. who is angry over Jimmy's death and frustrated with Curtis's tampering with his music, C.C. walks out on Rainbow Records and heads back to Detroit and to Effie. The two siblings reconcile and work together to produce Effie's comeback single, &quot;One Night Only&quot;. Just as the record begins gaining radio play in Detroit, however, Curtis strikes. Using payola, he forces radio DJs to play a disco cover of &quot;One Night Only&quot; by Deena Jones &amp; the Dreams instead of Effie's original, and the Dreams' version becomes a major hit.

Curtis has also learned of Deena's covert meetings with other film producers and asserts his control over his wife. Rebuffed, Deena sneaks into Curtis' office, where she discovers evidence of Curtis' payola schemes and finds a copy of Effie's version of &quot;One Night Only&quot;. She calls Effie and C.C., who arrive at the Rainbow offices with Marty and a lawyer. As Deena and Effie reconcile, Curtis works out a deal with the lawyer to avoid being reported to the FBI for payola: Rainbow Records will fund a new label for C.C., which will allow Effie's record national distribution. Curtis then confronts Deena, only to find that Effie's victory has inspired Deena to leave him and make it on her own.

As a result, Deena Jones &amp; the Dreams give a farewell performance at the Detroit Theater. At the conclusion of the concert, Effie joins Deena, Lorrell, and Michelle onstage and the reunited Dreams give one final performance of their signature song, &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, with Effie singing lead. As the concert ends, Curtis notices Magic in the front row and realizes that he is the girl's father.

Production history
=Pre-production=
Since the 1980s, several different attempts have been made to produce a film adaptation of ''Dreamgirls'', a Broadway musical loosely based upon the story of The Supremes and Motown Records, which won six Tony Awards in 1982. David Geffen, the stage musical's co-financier, retained the film rights to ''Dreamgirls'' and turned down many offers to adapt the story for the screen. He cited a need to preserve the integrity of ''Dreamgirls'' stage director Michael Bennett's work after his 1987 death.;Marr, Melissa (Dec 8, 2006). &quot;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06342/744656-254.stm After 'Dreamgirls', Geffen says goodbye to movies]&quot;. ''The Wall-Street Journal''. Retrieved on December 9, 2006 ; In 1987, Geffen, who ran his Warner Bros.-associated Geffen Pictures film production company at the time, began talks with Broadway lyricist and producer Howard Ashman to adapt it as a star vehicle for Whitney Houston, who was to portray Deena. The production ran into problems when Houston wanted to sing both Deena's and Effie's songs (particularly &quot;And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going&quot;), and the film was eventually abandoned.;Hill, Jeremy. &quot;[http://www.graiai.com/dreamgirls/ Film Version (2006): History]&quot;. ''Dreamgirls: Your Virtual Coffee Table Book of the Musical''. Retrieved on November 10, 2006.;

When David Geffen co-founded DreamWorks SKG in 1994 and dissolved Geffen Pictures, the rights to ''Dreamgirls'' remained with Warner Bros. Warner planned to go ahead with the film, to have been directed by Joel Schumacher, in the late 1990s following the success of the Tina Turner biopic ''What's Love Got to Do with It''. Schumacher planned to have Lauryn Hill portray Deena, and Kelly Price as Effie. After Warner's Frankie Lymon biopic ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' failed at the box office, the studio shut down development on ''Dreamgirls''.;

DreamWorks' ''Dreamgirls'' adaptation came about after the film version of the Broadway musical ''Chicago'' was a success at both the box office and the Academy Awards. Screenwriter and director Bill Condon, who wrote the screenplay for ''Chicago'', met producer Laurence Mark at a Hollywood party in 2002, where the two discussed a long held &quot;dream project&quot; of Condon's - adapting ''Dreamgirls'' for the screen.The two had dinner with Geffen and successfully convinced him to greenlight Condon's adaptation of ''Dreamgirls''. ;Ulmer, James (Spet. 10, 2006). &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/10/movies/moviesspecial/10ulme.html?ex=1315540800&amp;en=b4558150c8dbe335&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss After Conquering ‘Chicago,’ It’s On to Motown]&quot;.

=Stage to script changes=
While much of the stage musical's story remains intact, a number of significant changes were made. The Dreams' hometown - the setting for much of the action - was moved from Chicago to Detroit, the real-life hometown of The Supremes and Motown Records. The roles of many of the characters are related more closely to their real-life inspirations, following a suggestion by Geffen.; For example, Curtis Taylor's music empire expands beyond Deena Jones &amp; the Dreams, to more closely resemble that of Berry Gordy's Motown; and C.C. White, as the head of songwriting and production at Rainbow Records, is more clearly a Smokey Robinson analogue than he was in the original play. Other changes include the relocating of the talent show which opens the film from the Apollo Theater Amateur Night to a local showcase in Detroit and introducing the character Michelle Morris earlier in the story. 

Warner Bros. had retained the film rights to ''Dreamgirls'', and agreed to co-produce the film with DreamWorks. However, after casting was completed, the film was budgeted at $73 million and Warner backed out of the production. Geffen, taking the role of co-producer, brought Paramount Pictures in to co-finance and release ''Dreamgirls''. During the course of production, Paramount's parent company, Viacom, would purchase DreamWorks, aligning the two studios under one umbrella.; The completed film had a production budget of $75 million, making ''Dreamgirls'' the most expensive film with an all-black starring cast in cinema history. ;Gottfried, Marvin (2007). &quot;Introduction&quot;.

Anika Noni Rose, a Broadway veteran and a Tony Award winner, won the part of Lorrell Robinson after an extensive auditioning process. Rose, significantly shorter than most of her co-stars at five feet and two inches, was required to wear (and dance in) four and five-inch heels for much of the picture, which she later stated caused her discomfort.; This is not Rose's first screen appearance with an ''American Idol'' contestant; she was also in the unsuccessful ''From Justin to Kelly'' with Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini.

The most crucial casting decision involved the role of Effie White, the emotional center of the story. It was decided that a relative unknown would be cast, paralleling the casting of then-21-year-old Jennifer Holliday in that role for the original Broadway production. 783 singing actresses auditioned for the role of Effie White, with two of the top contenders being ''American Idol'' alumnae Fantasia and Jennifer Hudson. Hudson was eventually selected to play Effie and it was rumoured that Barrino rang Hudson after news broke and told her she had stolen her part. ;(Dec. 5 2005). &quot;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_23_108/ai_n15929105 'American Idol' finalist Jennifer Hudson gets lead role in 'Dreamgirls' movie&quot;].

''Dreamgirls'' musical supervisors Randy Spendlove and Matt Sullivan hired R&amp;B production team The Underdogs - Harvey Mason, Jr. and Damon Thomas - to restructure and rearrange the Henry Krieger/Tom Eyen ''Dreamgirls'' score so that it better reflected its proper time period, yet was also made to reflect modern R&amp;B/pop sensibilities. ; Coker, Cheo Hodari (2007). &quot;Introduction&quot;.

Revising the ''Dreamgirls'' score for film required the reduction of a significant portion of it. Much of the recitative, or sung dialogue, from the original musical was replaced with spoken dialogue. While most of the major musical moments from the stage musical are retained in the film, nine of the thirty-two individual ''Dreamgirls'' songs were omitted from the film. Among these are Lorrell's solo &quot;Ain't No Party&quot;, &quot;Press Conference&quot;, and &quot;Party, Party&quot;. Also removed is the musical's choral refrain of &quot;showbiz...it's just showbiz&quot;. C.C. and Effie's sung reunion from the second act, labeled &quot;Effie, Sing My Song&quot; for the film version, was shot but replaced with an alternative spoken version after test screenings.;

Four new songs were added for the film, &quot;Love You I Do&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, &quot;Perfect World&quot;, and &quot;Listen&quot;. All of the new songs feature music composed by original ''Dreamgirls'' stage composer Henry Krieger. With Tom Eyen having passed away in 1991, various lyricists were brought in by Krieger to co-author the new songs. &quot;Love You I Do&quot;, with lyrics by Siedah Garrett, is performed in the film by Effie during a rehearsal at the Rainbow Records studio. Willie Reale wrote the lyrics for &quot;Patience&quot;, a song performed in the film by Jimmy, Lorrell, C.C., and a gospel choir as the characters attempt to record a &quot;message song&quot; for Jimmy. &quot;Perfect World&quot;, also featuring lyrics by Garrett, is performed during the Rainbow 10th anniversary special sequence by Jackson 5 doppelgängers The Campbell Connection. &quot;Listen&quot;, with additional music by Scott Cutler &amp; Beyoncé Knowles, and lyrics by Anne Preven, is presented as a defining moment for Deena's character late in the film.

Following the success of the Cannes screening, DreamWorks and Paramount began a widespread &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; advertisement campaign, raising several eyebrows by demoting Jennifer Hudson to consideration for Best Supporting Actress and presenting Beyoncé Knowles as the sole Best Actress candidate, as opposed to having both compete for Best Actress awards. By contrast, the actresses who originated Hudson's and Knowles' roles on Broadway, Jennifer Holliday and Sheryl Lee Ralph, respectively, were both nominated for the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress, with Holliday winning the award.; The presentation of Knowles over Hudson as the sole Best Actress candidate was also considered highly ironic, given the plot of the film. ;

To give the story more exposure for the upcoming film release, DreamWorks Pictures and the licenser of the original play, The Tams-Witmark Music Library, announced that they would pay the licensing fees for all non-professional stage performances of ''Dreamgirls'' for the calendar year of 2006. DreamWorks hoped to encourage amateur productions of ''Dreamgirls'', and familiarize a wider audience with the play. As a result, more than fifty high schools, colleges, community theaters, and other non-commercial theater entities staged productions of ''Dreamgirls'' in 2006, and DreamWorks spent up to $250,000 subsidizing the licensing.; Olsen, Mark (Dec. 12, 2006). &quot;[http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-dreamgirls12dec12,0,693678.story One stage of film's marketing is on stage]&quot;.

Allusions to factual events
Aside from the overall plot of the film and elements already present in the stage musical, many direct references to Supremes, Motown, or R&amp;B/soul history in general are included in the film. In one scene, Effie saunters into Curtis' office and discusses Rainbow Records' latest LP, ''The Great March to Freedom'', a spoken word album featuring speeches by Martin Luther King, Jr..

Among the more direct references are the uses of adapted Supremes album cover designs for albums recorded in the film by the Dreams. Three Supremes albums - ''Let the Sunshine In'', ''Cream of the Crop'', and ''Touch'' - were reworked into Denna Jones &amp; The Dreams album designs, with the only changes to the artwork being the substitution of the names and images of the Supremes with those of Deena Jones &amp; the Dreams.

Smokey Robinson, however, was less than pleased about ''Dreamgirls allusions to Motown history. In a January 25, 2007 interview with NPR, Robinson expressed offense at the film's portrayal of its Berry Gordy analogue, Curtis Taylor Jr., as a &quot;villainous character&quot; who deals in payola and other illegal activities.;; He repeated these concerns in a later interview with ''Access Hollywood'', adding that he felt DreamWorks and Paramount owed Gordy an apology.;; On February 23, a week before the Oscars ceremony, DreamWorks and Paramount issued an apology to Gordy and the other Motown alumnae.;; Gordy issued a statement shortly afterwards expressing his acceptance of the apology.;

The payola scheme used in the film's script, to which Robinson took offense, is identical to the payola scheme allegedly used by Gordy and the other Motown executives, according to sworn court depositions from Motown executive Michael Lushka, offered during the litigation between the label and its chief creative team, Holland-Dozier-Holland.;;;; Several references are also made to Mafia-backed loans Curtis uses to fund Rainbow Records.;; Gordy was highly suspected, though never proven, to have used Mafia-backed loans to finance Motown during its later years.;;
