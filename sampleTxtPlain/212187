John Clayton Mayer (born October 16, 1977) is an American guitarist and singer-songwriter. Originally from Connecticut, he briefly attended Berklee College of Music, before moving to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1998, where he refined his skills and gained a following. His first two studio albums, ''Room for Squares'' and ''Heavier Things'', did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won a Best Male Pop Vocal Performance Grammy for &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland&quot;.

Mayer began his career performing mainly acoustic rock and pop, but gradually began a transition towards the blues genre in 2005 by collaborating with renowned blues artists such as B. B. King and forming the John Mayer Trio. The blues influence can be heard on his album ''Continuum'', released in September 2006. Mayer won Best Pop Vocal Album for ''Continuum'' and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Waiting on the World to Change&quot; at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in 2007.

Mayer's career pursuits have extended to stand-up comedy, design, and writing; he has written pieces for magazines, most notably for ''Esquire''. He is also involved in philanthropic activities through his &quot;Back to You&quot; fund and his efforts in reversing global warming.

Included with the limited Cypress-Mica model was the INCSvsJM gig bag that Mayer collaborated on with Incase designs. Not surprisingly, Mayer is a passionate collector of guitars, and in 2006 his collection was estimated at more than 200.;

In addition to guitars, Mayer's handiwork ranges from T-shirts, guitar totes and, most dear to his heart, sneakers. In August 2006, Mayer started JMltd, a minor clothing line of Mayer-themed merchandise that he has designed. The products are currently available only at his shows, as of his 2007 summer tour, although he has said they will eventually be available online.;Mayer, John (2006).

=Writing=
With the June 1, 2004, issue of ''Esquire'', Mayer began a column called, &quot;Music Lessons with John Mayer&quot;. Each article featured a lesson (some more scholarly than others) and his take on various topics, both of personal and popular interest. In the August 2005 issue, he invited readers to create music for orphaned lyrics he had written.;Mayer, John (September 2005), [http://www.esquire.com/features/articles/2005/050804_mfe_mayer.html &quot;The Giveaway: John Mayer's Songwriting Contest&quot;] ''Esquire''.144 (3):80; The winner was Tim Fagan of L.A., as announced in the following January's issue.;Mayer, John (January 2006), [http://www.esquire.com/features/articles/2005/051207_mfe_fagan.html &quot;Tim Fagan Is A Winner&quot;]. ''Esquire''. 145 (1):38;

Mayer is active online, and maintains four blogs: a MySpace page, a blog at his official site, another at Honeyee.com, as well as a photoblog at StunningNikon.com. Although they primarily deal with career-related matters, they also contain jokes, comic videos, his convictions, and his personal activities; they occasionally overlap in content. He is noted for writing the blogs himself, and not through a publicist.;

Stand-up comedy is a growing hobby of Mayer's. He makes regular, although random, appearances at the famed Comedy Cellar when he is in New York. He says that although it is risky, it helps him write better.;

Despite being principally a solo musician, Mayer has toured with many groups, including Maroon 5,;Dansby, Andrew (2004).
