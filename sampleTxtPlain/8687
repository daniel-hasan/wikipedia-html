Detroit () (;see List of U.S. place names of French origin;, help:IPA|pronounced ) is the largest city in the U.S. state of Michigan and the seat of Wayne County.Detroit is a major port city on the Detroit River, in the Midwest region of the United States. Located north of Windsor, Ontario Detroit is a geographical oddity as it is the only U.S. city that looks south to Canada. It was founded in 1701 by the Frenchman Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, making Detroit the oldest city in the Midwest.

It is known as the world's traditional automotive center&amp;mdash;&quot;Detroit&quot; is a metonym for the United States automobile industry&amp;mdash;and an important source of popular music, legacies celebrated by the city's two familiar nicknames, ''Motor City'' and ''Motown.'';;;; Other nicknames emerged in the twentieth century, including ''Rock City'', ''Arsenal of Democracy'' (during World War II), ''The D'', ''D-Town'', and ''The 3-1-3'' (its area code).;Commemorated in the song ''313'' by Eminem inhis 1996 release, ''Infinite'';

In 2007, Detroit ranked as the United States' eleventh most populous city, with 918,849 residents.;;;; At its peak, the city was the fourth largest in the country, but it has steadily declined in population since the 1960s. The name ''Detroit'' sometimes refers to the Metro Detroit area, a sprawling region with a population of 4,468,966;; for the Metropolitan Statistical Area and a population of 5,410,014;; for the nine-county Combined Statistical Area as of the 2006 Census Bureau estimates. The Windsor-Detroit area, a critical commercial link straddling the Canada-U.S. border, has a total population of about 5,900,000.;[http://www.citypopulation.de/World.html World Agglomerations] Retrieved on September 3, 2007.;

History

The city name comes from the Detroit River (in French ''le détroit du Lac Erie''), meaning &quot;the strait of Lake Erie,&quot; linking Lake Huron and Lake Erie, in the historical context the strait included Lake St. Clair and the St. Clair River.;; Traveling up the Detroit River on the ship ''Le Griffon'' (owned by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle), Father Louis Hennepin noted the north bank of the river as an ideal location for a settlement. There, in 1701, the French officer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded a settlement called ''Fort Détroit'', naming it after the comte de Pontchartrain, Minister of Marine under Louis XIV. Francois Marie Picoté, sieur de Belestre (Montreal 1719–1793) was the last French military commander at Fort Detroit (1758–1760), surrendering the fort on November 29 1760 to the British.

During the French and Indian War (1760), British troops gained control and shortened the name to ''Detroit''.
Several tribes led by Chief Pontiac,
an Ottawa leader, launched Pontiac's Rebellion (1763), including a siege of Fort Detroit. Partially in response to this, the British Royal Proclamation of 1763, included restrictions in unceded Indian territories. Detroit passed to the United States under the Jay Treaty (1796). In 1805, fire destroyed most of the settlement. A river warehouse and brick chimneys of the wooden homes were the sole structures to survive.;[http://www.ste-anne.org/dempsey.html Ste.

Detroit in the 1880s.

From 1805 to 1847, Detroit was the capital of Michigan. As the city expanded, the street layout followed a plan developed by Augustus B. Woodward, Chief Justice of the Michigan Territory. Detroit fell to British troops during the War of 1812 in the Siege of Detroit, was recaptured by the United States in 1813 and incorporated as a city in 1815. Prior to the American Civil War, the city's access to the Canadian border made it a key stop along the underground railroad.;Blockson, Charles and Chase, Henry (April 2005). [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1546/is_n2_v10/ai_16883766 Detroit - Follow the North Star, The Guiding Light of the Underground Railroad]. ''American Visions''.;
The Republican Party was founded in 1851 in nearby Jackson, Michigan by anti-slavery and Former Whig Zachariah Chandler.Then Lieutenant, the Future president Ulysses S. Grant was stationed in the city.His dwelling is still at the Michigan State Fairgrounds.Because of this local sentiment, many Detroiters volunteered to fight during the American Civil War, beginning with the &quot;Iron Brigade&quot; which defended Washington, D.C. early in the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln is quoted as saying &quot;Thank God for Michigan&quot;!Following the death of President Abraham Lincoln, George Armstrong Custer delivered a eulogy to the thousands gathered near Campus Martius Park. Custer led the Michigan Brigade during the American Civil War and called them the &quot;Wolverines.&quot;;Rosentreter, Roger (July/August 1998). &quot;Come on you Wolverines, Michigan at Gettysburg.&quot; ''Michigan History magazine''.;

Detroit's many Gilded Age mansions and buildings arose during the late 1800s. The city was referred to as the ''&quot;Paris of the West&quot;'' for its architecture, and for Washington Boulevard, recently electrified by Thomas Edison.;Woodford, Arthur M. (2001). This is Detroit: 1701–2001. ''Wayne State University Press.''; Strategically located along the Great Lakes waterway, Detroit emerged as a transportation hub. The city had grown steadily from the 1830s with the rise of shipping, shipbuilding, and manufacturing industries. In 1896, a thriving carriage trade prompted Henry Ford to build his first automobile in a rented workshop on Mack Avenue, and in 1904, the Ford Motor Company was founded. Ford's manufacturing — and those of automotive pioneers William C. Durant, the Dodge brothers, and Walter Chrysler—reinforced Detroit's status as the world's automotive capital; it also served to encourage truck manufacturers such as Rapid and Grabowsky. The industry spurred the city's spectacular growth during the first half of the twentieth century as it drew many new residents, particularly workers from the Southern United States. Strained racial relations were evident in the trial of Dr. Ossian Sweet, a black Detroit physician acquitted of murder after he shot into a large mob when he moved from the all-black part of the city to an all-white area.;Zacharias, Patricia (February 12, 2001).

With white flight to the suburbs, many Detroit inner-city neighborhoods endured a painful decline from the 1960s and 1970s leaving many areas of the inner-city with urban blight. The Twelfth Street riot in 1967 and court-ordered busing accelerated white flight from the city. An extensive freeway system constructed in the 1950s and 1960s facilitated commuting. The percentage of black residents increased rapidly thereafter. Accordingly, the city's tax base began a steep decline. Retailers and small business owners departed the city in the wake of the increased crime rate. Within a few years large numbers of buildings and homes were abandoned, many remaining for decades in a state of decay. In 1973, the city elected its first black mayor, Coleman Young. Young's chaotic style during his five terms in office was not well received by many whites, who continued to leave the city in large numbers.;[http://www.cnn.com/US/9711/29/young.obit.pm/ Detroit's 'great warrior,' Coleman Young, dies (November 29, 1997)].

The gasoline crises of 1973 and 1979 shook the U.S. auto industry as small cars from foreign makers made inroads into the traditional dominance of the domestic automakers. High-paying manufacturing jobs became scarce. Acute heroin and crack cocaine use afflicted the city with the influence of Young Boys Inc.|Butch Jones, Maserati Rick, and the Chambers Brothers. Drug-related violence and property crimes rose, and many abandoned homes were demolished as they had become havens for drug dealers. Sizable tracts have reverted to a form of urban prairie with wild animals spotted migrating into the city.;[http://www.detroitblog.org/?p=287 Wild Kingdom]. ''Detroit Blog''. Retrieved on March 8, 2006.; &quot;Renaissance&quot; has been a perennial buzzword among city leaders since the Twelfth Street riot and was reinforced by the construction of the Renaissance Center in the late 1970s. This complex of skyscrapers, designed as a &quot;city within a city,&quot; slowed but was unable to reverse the trend of businesses leaving the city's Downtown untill the 90's.

In 1980, Detroit hosted the Republican National Convention which nominated Ronald Reagan to a successful bid for President of the United States. Four years later, the city again appeared on the national radar, but for unwanted reasons: rioting in the wake of the Detroit Tigers' World Series championship left three dead and millions of dollars in property damage.

In the 1990s, the city began to enjoy a revival, much of it centered downtown. Comerica Tower at Detroit Center (1992) arose on the city skyline. In the ensuing years, three casinos opened in Detroit: MGM Grand Detroit, Motor City Casino, and Greektown Casino which are now adding resorts. New downtown stadiums were constructed for the Detroit Tigers and Detroit Lions in 2000 and 2002, respectively; this put the Lions' home stadium in the city proper for the first time since 1974. The city hosted the 2005 MLB All-Star Game and the 2006 Super Bowl XL, both of which prompted many improvements to the downtown area. The city's riverfront is the focus of much development; in 2007, the first portions of the Detroit River Walk were laid, including miles of parks and fountains. This new urban development in Detroit is a mainstay in the city's earnest desire to reinvent its economic identity through tourism.;Bailey, Ruby L.(August 22, 2007). The D is a draw: Most suburbanites are repeat visitors.''Detroit Free Press''.

Detroit's waterfront panorama shows a variety of architectural styles. The past meets the present as the city's historic Art Deco skyscrapers blend with the Post-modern architecture|post modern neogothic spires of the Comerica Tower at Detroit Center (1992). Together with the Renaissance Center, they form the city's marque. Examples of the Art Deco style include the Guardian Building and Penobscot Building downtown, as well as the Fisher Building and Cadillac Place in the New Center area near Wayne State University. Among the city's prominent structures are the nation's largest Fox Theatre, the Detroit Opera House, and the Detroit Institute of Arts.

While the downtown and New Center areas contain high-rise buildings, the majority of the surrounding city consists of low-rise structures and single-family homes. Outside of the city's core, apartments and high-rises are found in neighborhoods such as the East Riverfront extending toward Grosse Pointe and the Palmer Park neighborhood just west of Woodward. Many of the city's neighborhoods were constructed prior to World War II, and feature the architecture of the times. Wood frame and simple brick houses in the working class neighborhoods, larger brick homes in vast middle class neighborhoods, and ornate mansions in neighborhoods such as Brush Park, Woodbridge, Indian Village, Palmer Woods, Sherwood Forest, and others. The oldest neighborhoods are along the Woodward and Jefferson corridors, while newer neighborhoods, built as late as the 1950s, are found in the far west and closer to 8 Mile Road. Some of the oldest extant neighborhoods include Corktown, a working class, formerly Irish neighborhood, and Brush Park. Both are now seeing million dollar redevelopments and construction of new homes and condos.

Detroit's architecture is heralded as some of America's finest; many of the city's architecturally significant buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places and the city has one of the nation's largest surviving collections of late nineteenth and early twentieth century buildings.;Sharoff, Robert (2005).

As a birthplace of Techno music emerging in 1987 to venues worldwide, seminal Detroit Techno artists include Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson. This genre developed alongside Chicago's House music, yet was more influenced by funk and European electronic pioneers such as Kraftwerk, as well as Atkins's own early electro work. Techno reached a worldwide audience and in Europe triggered a revolution in both youth culture and music industry.

In addition, Detroit's garage rock of the 1990s rose to national attention with the bands The White Stripes, Von Bondies, the Dirtbombs, and Electric Six. In recent years, bands like The Hard Lessons and the Amino Acids revived garage rock. Hard rock, powered by 101.1 WRIF, produced local success for bands like Sponge.

Guyton painted polka dots and other symbols on several houses on Heidelberg Street. The city sued Guyton twice for creating a public nuisance, removed large parts of his art project, and tore down two vacant homes he had painted with various symbols. Nevertheless, the Heidelberg Project is continually updated.

With its proximity to Canada and its facilities, ports, major highways, rail connections and international airports, Detroit is an important transportation hub. The city has three international border crossings, the Ambassador Bridge, Detroit-Windsor Tunnel and Michigan Central Railway Tunnel, linking Detroit to Windsor, Ontario. The Ambassador Bridge is the single busiest border crossing in North America, carrying 27% of the total trade between the U.S. and Canada.;[http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/freight_analysis/ambass_brdg/ambass_brdge_ovrvw.htm Ambassador Bridge Crossing Summary (May 11, 2005)]. ''U.S. Department of Transportation''. Retrieved on April 8, 2007.;

Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW), the area's principal airport, is located in nearby Romulus and is a hub for Northwest Airlines and Spirit Airlines. Coleman A. Young International Airport (DET), previously called Detroit City Airport, is on Detroit's northeast side. Although Southwest Airlines once flew from the airport, there is currently only charter service and general aviation.;Sapte, Benjamin (2003). [http://www.erau.edu/research/BA590/chapters/ch2.htm Southwest Airlines: Route Network Development since 1971]. ''Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Retrieved on April 20, 2006.''; Toledo Express Airport in Toledo, Ohio, is a secondary commercial passenger airport. Willow Run Airport, in far-western Wayne County near Ypsilanti is a general aviation and cargo airport.

Metro Detroit has an extensive freeway system administered by the Michigan Department of Transportation.The city is at the crossroads for three Interstate Highways: I-94 (Edsel Ford Freeway), I-96 (Edward Jeffries Freeway), and I-75 (Fisher and Walter P. Chrysler|Chrysler Freeways). I-696 (Walter Reuther Freeway) serves the northern suburbs, while I-275 serves the western suburbs and I-375 is a short extension of the Chrysler Freeway. Other major routes are the John C. Lodge Freeway (M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10), the M-39 (Michigan highway)|Southfield Freeway (M-39) and the M-8 (Michigan highway)|Davison Freeway (M-8). Detroit and surrounding close suburbs are also served by a square grid network of major arterial roads.

Detroit is also connected via Interstate 94 to Kings Highway 401 and to major Southern Ontario cities such as London, Ontario and the Greater Toronto Area along Highway 401. Upon construction and completion of a third border crossing, Detroit and the surrounding area would have a third direct link to the 400-Series freeway network, and have a direct connection to Kings Highway 401, eliminating (or greatly diminishing) the traffic jams that plague the Ambassador Bridge, and the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel. The Blue Water Bridge near Sarnia, Ontario is another major commercial border crossing.

Mass transit in the region is provided by bus services. Ridership on the region's mass transit systems increased by 8.4% in 2006.;Foran, Janet - MDOT (March 22, 2007).[http://www.metromodemedia.com/devnews/masstransit11.aspx Mass tranit ridership jumps in Southeast Michigan].

From there, the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) provides service to the suburbs.Cross border service between the downtown areas of Windsor and Detroit is provided by Transit Windsor via the Tunnel Bus.;;

An automated guideway transit system known as the People Mover provides a 2.9&amp;nbsp;mile (4.6&amp;nbsp;km) loop in the downtown area and usually operates daily. Amtrak provides service to Detroit, operating itsservice between Chicago, and Pontiac. Baggage cannot be checked at this location; however, up to two suitcases in addition to any &quot;personal items&quot; such as briefcases, purses, laptop bags, and infant equipment are allowed on board as carry-ons. The current passenger facility is north of downtown. The ''J.W. Westcott II'', which delivers mail to freighters on the Detroit River, is the world's only floating post office.;[http://continuouswave.com/boats/westcott/ America's Floating ZIP Code 48222] ''J.W.
