The Dong Feng 4 or DF-4 (also known as the CSS-3) is a long-range two-stage Chinese Intermediate-range ballistic missile with liquid fuel (Nitric acid/UDMH).It was thought to be deployed in limited numbers in underground silos beginning in the 1970s and early 1980s.The Dong Feng 4 has a takeoff thrust of 1,224.00 kN, a takeoff weight of 82000 kg, a diameter of 2.25 m, a length of 28.05 m and a fin span of 2.74 m. The range of the Dong Feng 4, which is equipped with a 2,190 kg nuclear warhead with 3.3 Mt yield, with a nominal range of 4,750km. The missile uses an inertial guidance system, resulting in a CEP of 1,500 meters.

History
The decision to develop the DF-4 was made in 1965;U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Secretary of Defense, The Military Power of the People’s Republic of China, 2005, 2005, p. 28; in response to the U.S. ballistic missile submarine patrols that began operating out of Guam.

There were two versions of the missile developed;U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Secretary of Defense, The Military Power of the People’s Republic of China, 2000, 2000, p. 17.;, one version housed in caves or garages to be rolled out on launch and another silo based version.

The U.S. DoD estimates that the missile will continue to serve as a regional deterrence instrument until they can be replaced by the DF-31;U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Military Power of the People’s Republic of China, 2006, May 22, 2006, p. 50.;.
