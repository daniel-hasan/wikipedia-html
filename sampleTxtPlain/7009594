Hurricane Lane was the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Mexico since Hurricane Kenna of 2002.;; The thirteenth named storm, ninth hurricane, and sixth major hurricane of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season in the Eastern Pacific, Lane developed from a tropical wave on September 13 to the south of Mexico. It moved northwestward parallel to the coast of Mexico, and steadily intensified in an area of favorable conditions. After turning to the northeast, Lane attained peak winds of 125&amp;nbsp;mph (205&amp;nbsp;km/h), and made landfall in the Mexican state of Sinaloa at peak strength. It rapidly weakened and dissipated on September 17.

Throughout its path, Lane resulted in four deaths and moderate damage. Damage was heaviest in Sinaloa where the hurricane made landfall, including severe crop damage. Across Mexico, an estimated 4,320&amp;nbsp;homes were impacted by the hurricane, with about 248,000&amp;nbsp;people affected. Moderate flooding was reported in Acapulco, resulting in mudslides in some areas. Damage across the country totaled $2.2&amp;nbsp;billion (2006&amp;nbsp;MXN, $203&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;USD). 

Storm history

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 31. It moved westward without development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 10.;; An area of convection developed along the wave axis;; while located several hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It moved slowly westward;; and steadily organized.;; Convection and banding features organized around a developing center, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen-E on September 13.;; The system continued to organize and strengthened into Tropical Storm Lane early on September 14 while located 90&amp;nbsp;miles (145&amp;nbsp;km) off the coast of Mexico. Based on a potentially developing anticyclone over the storm and a track over warm water temperatures, the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme model predicted a 46% probability for rapid intensification of the storm.;; 

Lane continued to become better organized, with deep convection developing into a central dense overcast and well-defined outflow in the western half of the storm.;; Late on September 14, an eyewall began to develop while located a short distance off the Mexican coastline.;; Lane continued to strengthen as it turned more to the north-northwest, a motion caused due to the storm moving around the western periphery of a mid-level ridge over Mexico.;; Based on reports from Reconnaissance Aircraft, Lane intensified into a hurricane on September 15 while located 40&amp;nbsp;miles (65&amp;nbsp;km) west-northwest of Cabo Corrientes, Mexico.;; Rapid intensification ensued, and 6&amp;nbsp;hours after becoming a hurricane Lane strengthened into a 105&amp;nbsp;mph (165&amp;nbsp;km/h) Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 2 hurricane. Late on the 15th, the 10&amp;nbsp;mile (16&amp;nbsp;km) wide eye crossed over the Islas Marías.;; Early on September 16, Lane strengthened into a 115&amp;nbsp;mph (185&amp;nbsp;km/h) hurricane while located just 50&amp;nbsp;miles (85&amp;nbsp;km) off the coast of Mexico, the fifth major hurricane of the season.;;

Hurricane Lane continued to organize with its 9&amp;nbsp;mile (14&amp;nbsp;km) wide eye surrounded by very deep convection, and the storm strengthened further to reach winds of 125&amp;nbsp;mph (205&amp;nbsp;km/h) by midday on September 16.;; It turned unexpectedly to the northeast, and at 1915 UTC on the 16th, Hurricane Lane made landfall;; in a sparsely populated region;; of Sinaloa, 20&amp;nbsp;miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) southeast of El Dorado.; The combination of the mountainous terrain of Mexico and increasing west-southwesterly wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken,;; and the storm dissipated on September 17.;; The remnants of Lane later moved into Texas.;;

Preparations
Due to Lane's projected path near the western coast of Mexico, authorities closed ports to small boats in the cities of Acapulco;; and Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán|Lázaro Cárdenas, while officials in Los Cabos advised marinas to monitor the storm.;; Just weeks after Hurricane John took a similar path through the area, several tourists voluntarily left their vacations to fly home. Many residents boarded up buildings and bought hurricane supplies in preparation for the storm. Officials also closed schools across the state of Guerrero.;; In all, 40,400 tourists were evacuated from the Mexican coastline.;;

According to the Secretaría de Gobernación, under which the Mexican Civil Protection Service operates, there were 5.5 million homes and 21 million people in 21 states threatened by the system in all of Mexico.; | url = http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/566932.html}}; which qualifies them for aid from the ''Fondo de Desastres Naturales'' (natural disaster fund).; | url = http://www.tvazteca.com/hechos/archivos2/2006/9/137158.shtml}}; The arrival of the hurricane forced the closure of several flights at the General Rafael Buelna International Airport in Mazatlán, Sinaloa.;

Prior to entering the area, the National Weather Service issued a Flood Watch for large portions of Texas due to the remnants of Lane.;

Impact
Lane making landfall in Sinaloa
In Acapulco, the storm produced strong waves and heavy rain, leaving coastal streets with up to 16&amp;nbsp;inches (405&amp;nbsp;mm) of water. The heavy rainfall flooded 200 houses and caused a mudslide, resulting in the death of a 7 year-old boy. Flooding also occurred at the airport in Acapulco, though service was not interrupted. Offshore, strong waves capsized a boat, leaving one person missing. Heavy rainfall in the Michoacán city of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán|Lázaro Cárdenas overflowed a canal, forcing over 500 people to evacuate their homes.; 500&amp;nbsp;acres (2&amp;nbsp;km²) of crops were destroyed by Lane in Michoacán. Road and airport damage in Colima totaled to about $30&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;MXN, $2.7&amp;nbsp;million 2006&amp;nbsp;USD).; In Cajon de Pena in the state of Jalisco, rainfall totaled to 7.36&amp;nbsp;inches (187&amp;nbsp;mm).;; One man died in Pueblos Unidos after being knocked over by strong winds.;; Throughout Jalisco, 109 people had to evacuate their homes due to landslides and heavy rainfall.;; 

In El Dorado, near where the storm made landfall, the hurricane washed out away roads and destroyed many flimsy homes. Strong winds knocked down electricity towers, trees, and traffic signs, leaving many without power.; In Mazatlán, to the southeast of where Lane made landfall, the hurricane produced strong winds and heavy rains, causing street flooding and power outages.; The threat of the hurricane forced the cancellation of a Mexican Independence Day Parade.;; Between Mazatlán and the Sinaloa capital city of Culiacan, the hurricane destroyed a bridge, leaving dozens of trucks stranded. In Culiacan, one person died in Culiacan when he drove his car into a river, while several streets were flooded from the storm.; Throughout Sinaloa, several damaged roads left many communities cut-off from the rest of the country. Lane caused severe agricultural damage in the state, possibly reaching as high as $600&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;MXN, $55&amp;nbsp;million 2006&amp;nbsp;USD). The hurricane also damaged water treatment facilities and distribution systems in multiple communities, prompting the Mexican Department of Health to declare a sanitary alert in Sinaloa.;; Damage in Sinaloa totaled to around $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion (2006&amp;nbsp;MXN, $109.3&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;USD).;;

Throughout Mexico, Hurricane Lane killed four people.; An estimated 4,320&amp;nbsp;homes were impacted by the hurricane, with about 248,000&amp;nbsp;people affected. Water systems were damaged in nine municipalities, leaving thousands temporarily without water.

By the day after Hurricane Lane made landfall, most of the evacucated people returned to their homes to begin the cleanup process. Some tourists who remained in the area for the storm continued their vacations, while others tried to leave the area.;; The Mexican government declared a state of emergency for 9 municipalities in Sinaloa, allowing emergency funds to give relief support to the affected population.; Helicopters were used to distribute foods and locate cut-off residents. The government set up 3 temporary shelters in Mazatlán for 360 people and 3 shelters in Culiacán for about 1,000 affected residents.; To prevent the spread of Dengue fever, officials sent epidemiologists to 67&amp;nbsp;communities, with 18 mobile units and 15 Nebulizer units. By a month after the storm, all roads and highways impacted by the hurricane were open for transportation.;
