 is a Japanese anime series created by Sunrise. Directed by Shinichiro Watanabe and written by Keiko Nobumoto, it consists of 26 episodes (called &quot;sessions&quot;).It follows the adventures of a group of bounty hunters traveling on their spaceship, the Bebop, in the year 2071.

''Cowboy Bebop'' was a commercial success both in Japan and worldwide, notably in the United States. After its commercial success, Sony Pictures released the ''Cowboy Bebop'' movie, ''Cowboy Bebop: The Movie|Knockin' on Heaven's Door'' to theaters worldwide and followed up with an international DVD release. Two ''Cowboy Bebop'' manga series were adapted based on the anime, as well as two video games, one each for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 consoles.

''Cowboy Bebop'' has been strongly influenced by American music, especially the jazz movements of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and the early rock era of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Many of its action sequences, from space battles to hand-to-hand martial arts combat, are set and timed to music. Episodes are called ''Sessions'' (in reference to musicians playing a &quot;jam session&quot;), and titles are often borrowed from album or song names (such as ''Sympathy for the Devil'' or ''My Funny Valentine''), or make use of a genre name (''Mushroom Samba'' and ''Jupiter Jazz''), indicating the episode's musical theme.

Plot


In the year 2071, the crew of the spaceship ''Bebop'' travel the solar system trying to apprehend bounties. In the slang of the era, &quot;Cowboys&quot; are bounty hunters. Most episodes revolve around a specific bounty, but the show often shares its focus with the pasts of one of each of the four main characters and of more general past events, which are revealed and brought together as the series progresses.

=Background=
;
In the year 2021, ring-shaped hyperspace gateways were constructed across the solar system, allowing easy interplanetary travel. Unfortunately, the gate network contained a fatal instability that was ignored by the contractors who built the system. The instability grew until a gateway near Earth exploded, releasing a powerful burst of energy that cracked the Moon. In a cataclysmic disaster referred to as &quot;The Gate Accident&quot;, meteoric debris from the devastated Moon rained down on the planet, destroying much of Earth's surface. The death toll was by far the most catastrophic in recorded history; around 4.7 billion lives were lost in the initial incident alone. Decades later, debris from the disaster still falls on Earth with the same frequency as rainstorms (&quot;rock showers&quot; are a part of daily weather forecasts), forcing those remaining on Earth to live mostly underground. Most left Earth after the Gate Incident and spread out across the solar system, living in colonies on Venus, Mars, some habitable asteroids, Saturn's moon Titan, and the Galilean moons of Jupiter, as well as many space stations and a penal colony on Pluto. As shown by posters and ads the solar community is very interracial and English, French, Hebrew, Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Japanese are some of the languages shown to be currently used. The total population of the solar system in 2071, when the series takes place, is only 1.5 billion.;;

Many of Mars' impact craters were domed and transformed into thriving metropolitan areas for those who could afford it. Venus was terraformed, with oxygen provided by a species of oxygen-producing plants floating in the atmosphere. This is not a perfect process, however, since the spores of these plants cause “Venus Sickness” in some people. This condition, left untreated, may lead to blindness or death, and proper treatment is expensive. Many moons of Jupiter, such as Callisto, Io, Europa,and Ganymede, have been terraformed and colonized with varying degrees of success. Callisto is a cold, inhospitable moon (with the entirely male city, Blue Crow), while Io is a volcanic ball of sand with a toxic atmosphere. Meanwhile, Ganymede is almost completely covered by water and is known for itsdeclining fishing industry. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is a barren desert world whose population has been at war since the 2060s. The Titan War II in 2068 was survived by veterans such as Vicious, Gren, Vincent, and Electra. There is a Solar System Penitentiary on Pluto, and certain asteroids (such as Tijuana, the asteroid colony seen in the first episode) have been colonized for their minerals and other natural resources.

After the advent of space travel, the bounty system of the Old West was reinstated by the government to help curb growing crime levels. Bounty hunters are encouraged to capture criminals and return them (alive and relatively unharmed) to the authorities for monetary rewards, in part through a regular television broadcast of &quot;Big Shots&quot;, a bounty-hunter news program featuring a heavily-accented Mexican and a perky blonde with mostly-exposed breasts. These bounty hunters are now referred to as &quot;Cowboys&quot; in slang. In addition, ruthless crime syndicates have large influence in the Solar System, indulging in such fields as bribery, murder, extortion, drug dealing, money laundering and other criminal offenses. The Woolong is the universal currency, and paper money is less common since more people carry convenient money cards and rely on digital transfers.

The technology in the world of ''Cowboy Bebop'' has undergone advances to accommodate 21st century life in the Solar System. Medical advancements such as artificial organs, organ regrowth and cryogenic freezing have been mastered and are in full use. Home entertainment hardware called “Alfa Catch” provide a mind-machine interface for capturing or projecting images, games and movies. Virtual reality gaming is standard, and analog hardware such as videocassettes (VHS or beta) can only be found as antiques. Finally, World Wide Web has evolved into a massive Solar System Web (SSW).With these technological advancements also came a new breed of hackers, known as &quot;Net Divers&quot; in slang.

Space travel is made relatively easy and casual however artificial gravity is still limited to centrifugal force. Some directed energy weapons have also been built but principally ballistic and explosive weapons are used. In addition to that many gun models present today are widely used in the series.

Characters

The series features distinctively different main characters. The first two introduced in the series are Spike Spiegel and List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Jet Black|Jet Black. The two pilot their spaceship, the ''Bebop'', and work as bounty hunters. Spike is a former member of the Red Dragon crime syndicate who is haunted by a past love triangle between his former syndicate partner, List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Vicious|Vicious, and a mysterious woman named List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Julia|Julia. Jet is a former Inter-Solar System Police (ISSP) officer and the owner of the ''Bebop''. Once called &quot;The Black Dog&quot; by his fellow officers for his relentless nature, he bears a cybernetic arm as constant reminder of what happened when he rushed into trouble without looking first. Like Spike, he is haunted by the memory of a woman: Alisa, his longtime girlfriend who left him without notice.

More characters are introduced and become members of the ''Bebop'' crew. The first was List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Ein|Ein, a Welsh Corgi and former lab animal identified as a &quot;data dog&quot; by the scientists who created him.The terminology for this title is never explained, however it is suggested that he possesses enhanced intelligence (exceeding even that of humans) as he is seen in a later episode hacking into a computer system with great ease, whereas all previous attempts by the other characters had failed.In spite of his enhanced intelligence and comprehension, he is usually depicted as a regular dog and often spends most of his time hanging around the ship. Next was List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Faye Valentine|Faye Valentine, an amnesiac, awakened from a 54-year cryogenic slumber. She is tricked into assuming the debt of the man that woke her, and constantly attempts to gamble on quick cash as a solution to her problems. Her past is a mystery, even to herself, and is unraveled progressively throughout the series. The last addition was List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV|Edward, a young, eccentric computer genius and master hacker. Though she is a girl, there is a popular confusion as to Ed's gender. She gave herself the long and fanciful name &quot;Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV&quot; after being abandoned at an orphanage by her father, but it is revealed later on that her real name is Françoise Appledelhi. She goes by the name Radical Edward when hacking.

The main antagonist is List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Vicious|Vicious, Spike's former syndicate partner. Though he is not featured in most of the episodes, he is mentioned and shown in flashbacks in several episodes throughout the series. Other antagonists include a variety of bounty-heads that the crew hunt to collect funding.

Soundtrack

''Cowboy Bebop's'' 2nd Original Soundtrack CD, entitled ''No Disc''.Albums from the series rarely display art related to the show. Like the one above, they only indicate their connection by displaying the series name.
One of the most notable elements of ''Cowboy Bebop'' is its music. Performed by Yoko Kanno and The Seatbelts, a band Kanno assembled to perform music for the series, the jazz and blues themed soundtrack helps to define the show as much as the characters, writing, and even animation. Many fans find the soundtracks enjoyable to listen to as albums on their own, independent of the series. ''Cowboy Bebop'' was voted by IGN in 2006 as having the greatest soundtrack for an anime.;[http://music.ign.com/articles/708/708910p1.html IGN: Top Ten Anime Themes and Soundtracks of All-Time], IGN.;
