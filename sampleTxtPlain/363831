Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are institutions of higher education in the United States that were established before 1964 with the intention of serving the African American community.

Overview
There are 114 historically black colleges in the United States today, including public and private, two-year and four-year institutions.Many are liberal arts colleges or universities.

Other educational institutions currently have large numbers of African Americans in their student body, but as they were founded (or opened their doors to African Americans) after the ''Brown v. Board of Education'' ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court (the court decision which outlawed racial segregation of public education facilities), by definition they are not historically black colleges, but have been termed predominantly black.
