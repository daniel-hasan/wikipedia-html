&quot;Don't Forget About Us&quot; is a pop/contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B song co-written by Mariah Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Johnta Austin and Bryan-Michael Cox, and recorded by Carey for the re-release of her tenth studio album ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' (2005). It was co-produced by Carey, Dupri and Austin and released as the album's fifth single (fourth in North America) in late 2005 (see 2005 in music). The song reached number one in Brazil, Finland and the U.S., and the top forty elsewhere. It was nominated for two awards at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards.

About the record
The song is a midtempo jam that harkens back to 1990s-styled R&amp;B, and its protagonist regrets a failed relationship that never had a proper conclusion. Unlike &quot;We Belong Together&quot;, another song from ''The Emancipation of Mimi'', she is not very despondent, and has accepted that her ex-lover is now seeing someone else. However, she does not want him to forget what they had when they were together: &quot;Nothing can compare to your first true love, so I hope this will remind you, when it's for real it's forever, so don't forget about us&quot;. She also reminds her ex-lover that no matter who his new girl is, &quot;I bet she can't do like me, she'll never be MC&quot;.

Carey has been accused of repeating formulas for her singles if they are successful. For instance, in the past, she was called out for making songs such as &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; (1999) and &quot;Loverboy&quot; (2001) too similar to other up-tempos like &quot;Dreamlover&quot; (1993) and &quot;Fantasy&quot; (1995). Several music critics have drawn parallels between &quot;Don't Forget About Us&quot; and &quot;We Belong Together&quot;, the second and most successful single from ''The Emancipation of Mimi''. Chuck Taylor of ''Billboard'' magazine called the song &quot;little more than a continuation of the previous hit ... On its own, &quot;Forget&quot; is a soulful, satisfying track, but it suggests that Carey has hit a creative wall&quot;.;Taylor, Chuck.

Retrieved October 30 2005.; Bill Lamb of About.com, in a more positive summary of the song, wrote &quot;It doesn't mess with the brilliant formula of &quot;We Belong Together&quot; ... [but] those wanting variety from Mariah Carey need to look elsewhere&quot;.;Lamb, Bill.

&quot;Don't Forget About Us&quot; was nominated at the 2006 BET Awards in the BET.com &quot;Viewers' Choice&quot; category. It was nominated for the 2007 Grammy Awards for &quot;Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance&quot; and &quot;Best R&amp;B Song&quot;.

Chart performance
&quot;Don't Forget About Us&quot; officially impacted U.S. radio on October 11 2005, but had already been added to many radio station playlists before that. It premiered on the radio and the internet in late September. It reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in its eleventh week and spent two weeks at the top, from December 25 to January 8. It replaced &quot;Run It!&quot; by Chris Brown, and was replaced by D4L's &quot;Laffy Taffy&quot;. &quot;Don't Forget About Us&quot; stayed in the top forty for eighteen weeks and it also reached number one on several other ''Billboard'' charts, including the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles and Tracks. It has tied Carey with Elvis Presley for the most number-one singles in the U.S. by a solo artist (seventeen), and she is now behind only The Beatles, who hold the record with twenty.

On this point, there has been some controversy: ''Billboard'' magazine statistician Joel Whitburn credits Presley with eighteen number-one hits and not seventeen, because he counts one of Presley's double-sided hits as two separate number-one singles. However, the magazine officially credits Presley with seventeen as its current methodology treats the double A-side &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; and &quot;Hound Dog&quot; (1956) as a single unit. Presley's single came out during a period where four relevant charts were being compiled by ''Billboard'' magazine. &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; and &quot;Hound Dog&quot; each topped the Juke Box and Best Sellers in Stores charts, which were of roughly equal importance. After ''Billboard'' introduced the Hot 100 in 1958, their methodology was changed to use only the positions on the Best Sellers chart when publishing pre-Hot 100 data. Because &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; and &quot;Hound Dog&quot; were credited together on the Best Sellers chart, ''Billboard'' magazine's current metholodogy considers them to be one single, even though they each appeared at number one separately on the Most Played by Jockeys and Juke Box charts. Joel Whitburn rejects these retroactive backdated methodologies, and includes data for all four pre-Hot 100 charts in his series of ''Top Pop Singles'' books.;http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/chart_beat/bonus_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001736670; Carey also released a Hot 100 number-one double A-side, &quot;My All&quot;/&quot;Breakdown&quot; (1998), though the latter song did not reach number one on either of the Hot 100's component charts (the Hot 100 Single Sales and the Hot 100 Airplay) at the time.

The song's successful start to its U.S. chart performance was because of its strong radio airplay, but it advanced more slowly on the Hot 100 than Carey's previous two singles because of the lack of digital downloads. The album cut and several remixes were released to digital retailers on December 13 2005 when the song was already number two on the Hot 100, and it replaced Carey's perennially popular holiday single &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot; (1994) at number one on the iTunes Music Store, giving Carey the distinction of being the first recording artist to replace herself at number one. The RIAA later certified &quot;Don't Forget About Us&quot; gold.In ''Billboards 2006 recap the single ended at number fifty on the top 100 singles list.

&quot;Don't Forget About Us&quot; was successful outside the U.S.: it topped the charts in Brazil, Finland and reached the top twenty in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. However, it performed moderately in continental Europe.

Music video
Marilyn Monroe's unfinished film ''Something's Got to Give'' (1962).
Carey alludes to Monroe's ''Something's Got to Give'' (1962) in &quot;Don't Forget About Us&quot;.
The single's video reunited Carey with Paul Hunter, director of the video for &quot;Honey&quot; (1997), and it jumps between two different time frames. The first of these involves a tearful Carey in the present, while the second invokes memories of a relationship with a former lover (played by Dolce &amp; Gabbana model Christian Monzon). The video pays homage to actress Marilyn Monroe, whom Carey dressed up as in the music video for &quot;I Still Believe&quot; (1998): the shot in which Carey is in the pool with her leg protruding out of the water emulates an identical shot from Monroe's unfinished film ''Something's Got to Give'' (1962) in which she struck a similar pose.

The video was officially released promotionally on November 1 2005, but was premiered by surprise on October 29 on MTV's ''Spanking New'' series. It reached number one on ''Total Request Live'', where it eventually retired, on BET's ''106 &amp; Park'' countdown (for twenty-one non-consecutive countdowns), and on VH1's ''Top 20 Music Countdown''. The video's cosy, warm feeling, as well as the song's satisfying theme, likely contributed to the single's success in the holiday season, as the song peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 on the issue dated on Christmas Day.

Remixes
The main remix of &quot;Don't Forget About Us&quot; was produced by Jermaine Dupri and is known as the &quot;Mr. Dupri mix&quot;. It features guest appearances from rappers Juelz Santana, Krayzie Bone &amp; Layzie Bone, and Carey's parts are greatly reduced. It premiered on Chicago's B-96 FM on November 29 2005. The &quot;Mr. Dupri mix&quot; later was added to iTunes Music Store for download, while several dance remixes (by Ralphi Rosario &amp; Craig J., Quentin Harris and Tony Moran &amp; Warren Rigg) were produced and made available for sale at other download retailers. The Mr. Dupri mix sold well enough to help &quot;Don't Forget About Us&quot; top Billboard's Hot Digital Songs chart, whereas the album cut reached only number two on the Hot Digital Tracks chart.

In January 2007 a new remix titled the &quot;Desert Storm&quot; remix, produced by DJ Clue (who also remixed &quot;We Belong Together&quot; and &quot;Shake It Off&quot;) and featuring Fabolous and Styles P., was released to radio. It was originally supposed to be recorded with Cam'ron and Da Brat, but their recording session was cancelled after Cam'ron was injured during a shooting. On this version of the song, Carey's verses remain the same but although the chorus is altered, it keeps its original message and can be heard in its original lyrics once near the end of the song. The &quot;Desert Storm&quot; remix appeared on DJ Clue's album ''The Professional, Pt. 3''. A video was also helmed for the &quot;Desert Storm&quot; mix. It can be found on Clue's official MySpace page and has shots of Carey, DJ Clue and Fabulous in the studio and out having fun.
