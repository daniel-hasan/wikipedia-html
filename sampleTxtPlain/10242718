The SS ''Foundation Franklin'' was a sea-going salvage vessel operated by Foundation Maritime between 1930-1949. The ship wasbuilt for the British Navy in 1918.

History

The ''Foundation Franklin'' was built as HMS ''Frisky'' [a Racia type tug] by John Lewis and Sons Shipbuilding at Dundee, Scotland, in 1918. She was designed to move capitol warships, and operate in rough weather. 
The ship was commissioned in the spring of 1919, but the ending ofWorld War I ended the need for the HMS ''Frisky''. She was used to tow warships to Scapa Flow until being laid up. In 1924, the ship was sold and performed towing work on the Rhine River and in the Baltic Sea. The ''Frisky'' was later purchased by a German project intending to tow barges across the Atlantic Ocean to Argentina and renamed SS ''Gustavo Ipland'', but the project was destined to fall through. The former HMS ''Frisky'' then was laid up until 1930.; 
 ;

The ship was purchased in January, 1930 at Hamburg, Germany byFoundation Maritime representative Captain James Sutherland at Hamburg, Germany, Brought to Southampton for further refit and inspection the same year where she was registered under the the Red Ensign and given the name ''Foundation Franklin''. Brought to Foundation Maritime headquarters in Montreal, Canada In 1931, she was further refitted by Halifax Shipyards for Atlantic salvage service.

Later, a homeport was established at Halifax, Nova Scotia on Lower Water Street.; 
 ;
One of the most successful and hard-working vessels of her type, she continued to operate in the salvage role until 1948, when, during the tow of the vessel ''Arosa'' a hurricane damaged the ship beyond economical repair.

''Foundation Franklin'' was converted to from coal to fuel oil [the Franklin remained coal fired until broken up] in 1945.
