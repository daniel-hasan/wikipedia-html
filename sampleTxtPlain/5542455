''Outrageous Betrayal: The Dark Journey of Werner Erhard from est to Exile'' is a non-fiction book on Werner Erhard, written by legal journalist Steven Pressman. The book was first published in 1993 by St. Martin's Press, and a second edition was published in 1995 by Random House.;;;;''Outrageous Betrayal'' book gives an account of Werner Erhard's early life, his exploration of various forms of self-improvement techniques including Scientology and Mind Dynamics, and his foundation of Erhard Seminars Training &quot;est&quot; and later Werner Erhard and Associates and the est successor course, &quot;The Forum&quot;.Pressman details the quick financial success Erhard had with these companies, as well as controversies relating to litigation involving some former participants in his courses.The work concludes by going over the impact of a March 3, 1991 ''60 Minutes'' broadcast on CBS where family members made allegations of abuse against Erhard, and his decision to leave the United States.

The book received positive reviews in ''Library Journal'', ''Publishers Weekly'' and ''Booklist'', but ''Kirkus Reviews'' questioned why the author did not discuss the methodology of est or the reasons for its popularity and financial success. It has been cited within the United States House of Representatives, as well as in several works on psychology, cults and new religious movements, for historical background on Erhard and his companies. In 1998, Landmark Education, the successor company to The Forum, attempted to compel Steven Pressman to reveal the unnamed sources he had consulted while researching ''Outrageous Betrayal.'' This matter was later dropped after Landmark Education settled litigation against the Cult Awareness Network (CAN).As a result of this settlement, CAN agreed not to sell copies of ''Outrageous Betrayal'' for at least five years after it emerged from bankruptcy.

Contents
In ''Outrageous Betrayal'', Steven Pressman gives a chronological account of Werner Erhard's life and businesses, from high-school years through his formation of companies that delivered awareness training and the later controversies surrounding his business and family life.The book goes into detail regarding his early life as Jack Rosenberg and his name change to Werner Erhard, his move to California, and the initial inspirations behind the training that would come to be known as &quot;est.&quot;Pressman writes that Erhard was inspired by the self-help course Mind Dynamics, cybernetics, the book ''Think and Grow Rich'' by Napoleon Hill, and ''Psycho-Cybernetics'' by Maxwell Maltz, and by Scientology and the writings of L. Ron Hubbard.He also notes how Erhard was helped in the formation of his first awareness training company, Erhard Seminars Training, by an attorney skilled in tax law.;;;

Pressman notes how Erhard and his businesses became successful within two years of foundation, and writes that his awareness training programs trained over half a million people in his courses and brought in tens of millions of dollars in revenue.The book then describes controversies relating to both Erhard's businesses and his reported treatment of his family.Pressman details some of the lawsuits and professional desertions that hurt his business, as well as some of his conflict with the Internal Revenue Service.The end of the book describes the impact and aftermath of a March 3, 1991 ''60 Minutes'' investigation on CBS News, where one of his daughters accused him of sexual abuse.Pressman also describes the successor company to est, Werner Erhard and Associates, and Erhard's decision to sell the &quot;technology&quot; of Erhard's course The Forum to his employees and leave the United States.;;;;

Reception
''Outrageous Betrayal'' received a positive review in ''Library Journal'', where the book was described as &quot;a compelling account of the 1980s guru who rose from selling used cars to peddling personal transformation.&quot;;;The reviewer recommended public libraries carry the book, and that they place it next to Wendy Kaminer's ''I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional''.;''Publishers Weekly'' also reviewed the work, and briefly described Pressman's assessment of Werner Erhard.The review noted: &quot;Pressman here cuts into him with surgical precision.&quot;;;A review published in the American Library Association's ''Booklist'' noted that the controversy surrounding Erhard was not new, but wrote that &quot;Pressman pulls the details together effectively.&quot;;;The reviewer went on to comment: &quot;''Outrageous Betrayal'' is a disturbing but fascinating object lesson in the power of charisma divorced from conscience.&quot;;

An analysis in ''Kirkus Reviews'' noted the choice of title by the author, and asserted that Pressman: &quot;makes no pretense to objectivity here: His Werner Erhard is a charismatic but abusive con man with a genius for repackaging and marketing others' ideas.&quot;;;The review briefly summarized key points of the book, and noted that even Pressman did not know of Erhard's whereabouts at the time of publication.;''Kirkus Reviews'' criticized ''Outrageous Betrayal'' for not delving into the nature of the est training itself, noting that by concentrating on the negative aspects of Erhard's life, the work fails to explain why the est seminars appealed to so many people.;Other books on subjects related to psychology, cults and new religious movements have later referenced ''Outrageous Betrayal'' for background on Werner Erhard and the est movement, including Janja Lalich's ''Bounded Choice'' and Irvin Yalom's ''The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy''.;;;;;;;;;;;;

''Outrageous Betrayal'' in testimony, U.S. House of Representatives, 1995;
In 1995, ''Outrageous Betrayal'' was cited in a report on the United States Department of Transportation by the United States House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations.;;This was in reference to a Congressional investigation of Gregory May and controversial trainings given by his company Gregory May Associates (GMA) to the Federal Aviation Administration.;The testimony given stated that, according to ''Outrageous Betrayal'', a member of GMA's board had been influenced by Erhard Seminars Training and the Church of Scientology.;Events related to this Congressional investigation were reported on by Cokie Roberts in ''Nightline'', and in the book ''Flying Blind, Flying Safe''.;;;;;;Gregory May was later convicted of mail fraud and sentenced to six months in prison, in April 1996.;;

Landmark Education lawsuit
In 1998, Landmark Education spent months attempting to compel Steven Pressman to respond to deposition questions aimed at obtaining thesources he used for research on ''Outrageous Betrayal''.;;In the &quot;Acknowledgments&quot; section of ''Outrageous Betrayal'', Pressman wrote that he relied upon both named and unnamed sources for information in the book.;According to a piece published on Rick Ross's website &quot;Introduction to the Landmark Education litigation archive&quot;, the suit was brought under the pretext of compelling legal discovery for use in Landmark Education's lawsuit against the Cult Awareness Network (CAN).;The piece also asserts that Pressman concluded the deposition questioning was mainly a form of harassment.;The piece was written by attorneys Skolnik and Norwick of Lowenstein Sandler PC, who defended Ross ''pro-bono'' in a separate lawsuit initiated by Landmark Education.;Skolnik and Norwick cited the discovery commissioner in the Pressman case (who entered an interim order in the matter), as stating that: &quot;..it does not appear that the information sought [from Mr. Pressman] is directly relevant or goes to the heart of the [CAN] action, or that alternative sources have been exhausted or are inadequate.&quot;; 

The action against Pressman was dropped after the Cult Awareness Network litigation was settled.;;;As a result of the Cult Awareness Network settlement with Landmark Education, CAN agreed to cease selling copies of ''Outrageous Betrayal'' for at least five years.From the resolution of the CAN board of directors: &quot;In the interests of settling a dispute and in deference to Landmark's preference, however, CAN now agrees not to sell the Pressman Book for at least five years after CAN emerges from bankruptcy.&quot;;;
