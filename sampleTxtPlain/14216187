In enzymology, a maltose alpha-D-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

:maltose ;\rightleftharpoons; alpha,alpha-trehalose

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, maltose, and one product, alpha,alpha-trehalose.

This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups.The systematic name of this enzyme class is maltose alpha-D-glucosylmutase. Other names in common use include trehalose synthase, and maltose glucosylmutase.This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism.
