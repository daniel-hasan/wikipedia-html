''Serial Experiments Lain'' is an anime series directed by Ryutaro Nakamura, original character design by Yoshitoshi ABe, screenplay written by Chiaki J. Konaka, and produced by Yasuyuki Ueda (credited as ''production 2nd'') for Triangle Staff. It was broadcast on TV Tokyo from July to September 1998. A PlayStation game with the same title was released in November 1998 by Pioneer LDC.

''Lain'' is influenced by philosophical subjects such as reality, identity, and communication.; ;
; The series focuses on Lain Iwakura, an adolescent girl living in suburban Japan, and her introduction to the Wired, a global communications network similar to the Internet. Lain lives with her middle class family, which consists of her inexpressive older sister Mika, her cold mother, and her computer-obsessed father. The first ripple on the pond of Lain's lonely life appears when she learns that girls from her school have received an e-mail from Chisa Yomoda, a schoolmate who committed suicide. When Lain receives the message at home, Chisa tells her (in real time) that she is not dead, but has just &quot;abandoned the flesh&quot;, and has found God in the Wired. From then on, Lain is bound to a quest which will take her ever deeper into both the network and her own thoughts.

The anime series is licensed in North America by Geneon (previously Pioneer Entertainment) on DVD, VHS and LaserDisc. It was also released in Singapore by Odex. The video game, which shares only the themes and protagonist with the series, was never released outside Japan.

The series shows influences from topics such as philosophy, computer history, cyberpunk literature and conspiracy theory, and it was made the subject of several academic articles. English language anime reviewers found it to be &quot;weird&quot; and unusual, but reviews were still generally positive. Producer Ueda said he intended Japanese and American audiences to form conflicting views on the series, but was disappointed in this regard, as the impressions turned out to be similar.

Plot
The image of Lain going to school is a persistent one.


''Serial Experiments Lain'' deals directly with the definition of reality, which makes its complex plot difficult to summarize.;; The story is primarily based on the assumption that everything flows from human thought, memory, and consciousness.;Alice: &quot;One have never existed if there is no memory.&quot; ''Serial Experiments Lain'', Layer 13: EGO.;;
; Therefore, events on screen can be considered hallucinations of Lain, of other protagonists, or of Lain fabricating the hallucinations of others.; Story misdirection is central to the plotline;;; even the offscreen voices or narrations' information cannot be considered truthful.;; The series consists of a cross-reflection of philosophical themes instead of the traditional linear events depiction: episodes are called &quot;layers&quot;.

''Serial Experiments Lain'' describes &quot;the Wired&quot; as the sum of human communication networks, created with the telegraph and telephone services, and expanded with the Internet and subsequent networks. The anime assumes that the Wired could be linked to a system that enables unconscious communication between people and machines without physical interface. The storyline introduces such a system with the Schumann resonance, a property of the Earth's magnetic field that theoretically allows for unhindered long distance communications. If such a link was created, the network would become equivalent to Reality as the general consensus of all perceptions and knowledge (''see consensus reality''). The thin line between what is real and what is possible would then begin to blur.;Narrator: &quot;It is called &quot;Shuman Effect&quot;. It is the brain wave of the earth. But we still don't know how it affects humans. Human's population on earth will become the same number as neurons in a brain. Douglas Rachcov claims that it will awake the consciousness of earth itself by connecting humans to each other by network.&quot; ''Serial Experiments Lain'', Layer 09: PROTOCOL. Eiri Masami: &quot;Humans have been already connected. I just restored them. You did cause it. So you may do anything you want.&quot; Layer 12: LANDSCAPE;

Eiri Masami is introduced as the project director on Protocol 7 (the next generation internet protocol in the series' timeframe) for major computer company Tachibana Labs. He has secretly included code of his own creation to give himself control of the Wired through the wireless system described above. He then &quot;uploaded” his consciousness into the Wired and died in real life a few days after. These details are unveiled around the middle of the series, but this is the point where the story of ''Serial Experiments Lain'' begins.

Masami later explains that Lain is the artifact by which the wall between the virtual and material worlds is to fall, and that he needs her to get to the Wired and &quot;abandon the flesh”, as he did, to achieve his plan.;Eiri: &quot;But there is one believer left. If there is one believer, I'm still God.&quot; Lain: &quot;Who?&quot; Eiri: &quot;Are you kidding? It's you, Lain. You can be you because of me. You were born in the wired. You were a legend in the wired, and a heroine in a Wired fairy tale (...) You don't need your flesh, Lain. (...) You'll love me who sent you to this world.&quot; ''Serial Experiments Lain'', Layer 10: LOVE.; The series sees him trying to convince her through interventions, using the promise of unconditional love, charm, fate, and, when all else fails, threats and force.

In the meantime, the anime follows a complex game of hide-and-seek between the &quot;Knights of the Eastern Calculus&quot;, hackers whom Masami claims are &quot;believers that enable him to be a God in the Wired&quot;, and Tachibana Labs, who try to regain control of Protocol 7.

In the end, the viewer sees Lain realizing, after much introspection, that she has absolute power over everyone's mind and over reality itself. Her dialogue with different versions of herself show how she feels shunned from the material world, and how she is afraid to live in the Wired, where she has the possibilities and responsibilities of a goddess.;Lain 1: &quot;I'm nowhere... If I am nowhere, what am I? Where am I?&quot; Lain 2: &quot;Even if you don't like, it is Lain. It is me. You know it. Yes. Lain is not a human. (laugh) Lain exists everywhere. Lain watches still. Yes, Lain is a goddess!&quot; Lain1: &quot;No! No!&quot; Layer 13: EGO; The last scenes feature her erasing everything connected to herself from everyone’s memories. She is last seen unchanged - re-encountering her old friend Alice, who is now married. Lain promises herself to look after Alice.

Design
''Serial Experiments Lain'' was conceived as a series original to the point of being considered &quot;an enormous risk&quot; by its producer Yasuyuki Ueda.;;

=Writing=
The authors have been asked in interviews if they had been influenced by ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'', in the themes and graphic design.;; This was strictly denied by writer Chiaki J. Konaka in an interview, arguing that he had not seen ''Evangelion'' until he finished the fourth episode of ''Lain''.; 
Being primarily a horror movies writer, his stated influences are Jean-Luc Godard|Godard (specially for using typography on screen), ''The Exorcist'', ''Hell House'', and Dan Curtis's ''House of Dark Shadows''.;
Alice's name, like the names of her two friends Julie and Reika, came from a previous production from Konaka, ''Alice in Cyberland'', which in turn was largely influenced by ''Alice in Wonderland''.; As the series developed, Konaka was &quot;surprised&quot; by how close Alice's character became to the original ''Wonderland'' character.;

Lain's custom computer features holographic displays and water cooling.

''Lains creators have been said to be &quot;quite well read&quot; and to &quot;draw upon dozens if not hundreds of real-world sources for what seem to be the most wiktionary:outré|outré concepts in the story&quot;:;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialExperimentsLain ''Serial Experiments Lain'' on tvtropes.org], retrieved on 10-10-2006.;

Vannevar Bush (and Memex), John C. Lilly, Timothy Leary and his 8-Circuit Model of Consciousness, Ted Nelson and Project Xanadu are cited as precursors to the Wired.;Animerica, (Vol. 7 No. 9, p.28); Douglas Rushkoff and his book ''Cyberia'' were originally to be cited as such,; and in ''Lain'' Cyberia became the name of a nightclub populated with hackers and techno-punk teenagers.; Likewise, the series' Deus ex machina lies in the conjunction of the Schumann resonance and Jung's collective unconscious (the authors chose this term over Kabbalah and Akashic Record).; Majestic 12 and the Roswell UFO incident are used as examples of how a hoax might still have an impact on history, even after having been exposed as such, by creating sub-cultures.; This links again to Vannevar Bush, the alleged &quot;brains&quot; of MJ12. Two of the literary references in ''Lain'' are quoted through Lain's father: he first logs onto a website with the password &quot;Think Bule Count One Tow&quot; (&quot;Think Blue, Count Two&quot; is an Instrumentality of Man story featuring virtual persons projected as real ones in people's minds);; and his saying that &quot;madeleines would be good with the tea&quot; in the last episode makes ''Lain'' &quot;one of the only cartoons ever to allude to Proust&quot;.;Yasuo: &quot;I will bring madeleines next time. They will taste good with the tea.&quot; ''Serial Experiments Lain'', Episode 13, &quot;Ego&quot;.;;;

=Character design=
ABe imagined Lain cutting her own hair and making a ponytail of what was left.;
Yoshitoshi ABe confesses to have never read manga as a child, as it was &quot;off-limits&quot; in his household.;; His major influences are &quot;nature and everything around him&quot;.;Specifically speaking about ''Lains character, ABe was inspired by Kenji Tsuruta, Akihiro Yamada, Range Murata, and Yukinobu Hoshino.; In a broader view, he has been influenced in his style and technique by Japanese artists Chinai-san and Tabuchi-san.;

The character design of Lain isn’t ABe’s sole responsibility: her distinctive left forelock was a demand from Yasuyuki Ueda. The goal was to produce asymmetry to reflect Lain’s unstable and disconcerting nature.;’’FRUiTS Magazine No. 15’’, October 1998.; It was designed as a mystical symbol, as it is supposed to prevent voices and spirits from being heard by the left ear.; The bear pajamas she wears were a demand from character animation director Takahiro Kishida. Though bears are a trademark of the Konaka brothers, Chiaki Konaka first opposed the idea.;Director Nakamura then explained how the bear motif could be used as a shield for confrontations with her family. It is a key element of the design of the shy &quot;real world&quot; Lain (''see &quot;mental illness&quot; under #Themes|themes'').;When she first goes to the Cyberia night club, she wears a bear hat for similar reasons.;The pajamas were finally considered as possible fan-service by Konaka, in the way they enhance Lain’s nymph aspect.;

Abe’s original design was generally more complicated than what finally appeared on screen. As an example, the X-shaped hairclip was to be an interlocking pattern of gold links. The links would open with a snap, or rotate around an axis until the moment the &quot; X ” became a &quot; = ”. This was not used as there is no scene where Lain takes her hairclip off.;''Manga Max'' Magazine, September 1999, p.22, &quot;Unreal to Real&quot;;

=Themes=
''Serial Experiments Lain'' is not a conventionally linear story, but &quot;an alternative anime, with modern themes and realization&quot;.;''Benkyo!'' Magazine, March 1999, p.16, &quot;In My Humble Opinion&quot;; Themes range from theological to psychological and are dealt with in a number of ways: from classical dialogue to image-only introspection, passing by direct interrogation of imaginary characters.;
Communication, in its wider sense, is one of the main themes of the series,;; not only as opposed to loneliness, but also as a subject in itself. Writer Konaka said he wanted to directly &quot;communicate human feelings&quot;. Director Nakamura wanted to show the audience - and particularly viewers between 14 and 15 - &quot;the multidimensional wavelength of the existential self: the relationship between self and the world&quot;.;Animerica, Vol 7, No 9, p.28; The intrusion of technology in the social structure is part of the process described:; as Lain embraces the Wired, the viewer can see her drifting apart from her friends and family, to the point where &quot;she can no longer relate to and interact with her fellow humans&quot;.;;
Loneliness, if only as representing a lack of communication, is recurrent through ''Lain''.; Lain herself (according to Anime Jump) is &quot;almost painfully introverted with no friends to speak of at school, a snotty, condescending sister, a strangely-apathetic mother, and a father who seems to want to care but is just too damn busy to give her much of his time&quot;.;Friendships turn on the first rumor;;''Serial Experiments Lain'', Layer 08: RUMORS;; and the only insert song of the series is named ''Kodoku no shigunaru'', literally &quot;signal of loneliness&quot;.;;;
The different personalities of Lain have their names written using different scripts.
Mental illness in general, and specifically Dissociative identity disorder is a significant theme in ''Lain'':; she is constantly confronted with alter-egos, to the point where writer Chiaki Konaka and Lain's seiyuu Kaori Shimizu had to agree on subdividing the character's dialogues between three different orthographs.; The three names designate distinct &quot;versions&quot; of Lain: the real-world, &quot;childish&quot; Lain has a shy attitude and bear pajamas. The &quot;advanced&quot; Lain, her Wired personality, is bold and questioning. Finally, the &quot;evil&quot; Lain is sly and devious, and does everything she can to harm Lain or the ones close to her.; As a writing convention, the authors spelled their respective names in kanji, katakana, and roman characters (see picture).;, page 42 ;;
Reality never has the pretense of objectivity in ''Lain''.;''Manga Max'' Magazine, September 1999, p.21, &quot;God's Eye View&quot;; Acceptations of the term are battling throughout the series, such as the &quot;natural&quot; reality, defined through normal dialog between individuals; the material reality; and the tyrannic reality, enforced by one person onto the minds of others.; A key debate to all interpretations of the series is to decide whether matter flows from thought, or the opposite.;Serial Experiments Lain, Layer 06: KIDS: &quot;your physical body exists only to confirm your existence&quot;.;; The production staff carefully avoided &quot;the so-called God's Eye Viewpoint&quot; to make clear the &quot;limited field of vision&quot; of the world of ''Lain''.;;
Theology plays its part in the development of the story too. ''Lain'' has been viewed as a questioning of the possibility of an infinite spirit in a finite body.;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060302194747/http://www.ahcca.unimelb.edu.au/refractory/journalissues/vol3/colman.htm Study on ''Lain'', ''Buffy'', and ''Attack of the clones''] by Felicity J. Coleman, lecturer at the University of Melbourne. From the Internet Archive.; From self-realization as a goddess to deicide,; religion (the title of a layer) is an inherent part of ''Lain'' 's background.;

=Apple computers=
Layer 11: INFORNOGRAPHY features the Apple advertising slogan and an iMac.
''Lain'' contains extensive references to Apple computers, as the brand was used at the time by most of the creative staff, such as writers, producers, and the graphical team.; As an example, the title at the beginning of each episode is announced by the Apple Computer Speech synthesis programPlainTalk, using the voice ''&quot;Whisper&quot;''. Tachibana Industries, the company that creates the NAVI computers, is a reference to Apple computers: &quot;tachibana&quot; means &quot;Mandarin orange&quot; in Japanese. NAVI is the abbreviation of Knowledge Navigator, and the HandiNAVI is based on the Apple Newton, one of the world's first PDAs. The NAVIs are seen to run &quot;Copland OS Enterprise&quot; (this reference to Copland was an initiative of Chiaki J. Konaka|Konaka, a declared Apple fan),; and Lain's and Alice's NAVIs closely resembles the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh and the iMac respectively. 

During a series of disconnected images, an iMac and the Think Different advertising slogan appears for a short time, while the ''Whisper'' voice says it.;''Serial Experiments Lain'', Layer 11: INFORNOGRAPHY.; This was an unconcerted insertion from the graphic team, also Mac-enthusiasts.; Other subtle allusions can be found: &quot;Close the world, Open the nExt&quot; is the slogan for the ''Serial Experiments Lain'' video game. NeXT was the company that produced NeXTSTEP, which later evolved into Mac OS X after Apple bought NeXT. Another example is &quot;To Be Continued.&quot; at the end of episodes 1–12, with a blue &quot;B&quot; and a red &quot;e&quot; on &quot;Be&quot;: ''this'' &quot;Be&quot; is the original logo of Be Inc., NeXT's main competitor in its time.;;

Reception
''Lain'' was first broadcast in Tokyo at 1:15 a.m. JST. The word &quot;weird&quot; appears almost systematically in English language reviews of the series,;;;, , ; or the alternatives &quot;bizarre&quot;,;; and &quot;atypical&quot;,;; due mostly to its almost total absence of sexual and violent content, and due to its philosophical and psychological context. Critics responded positively to these thematic and stylistic characteristics, and it was awarded an Excellence Prize by the 1998 Japan Media Arts Festival for &quot;its willingness to question the meaning of contemporary life&quot; and the &quot;extraordinarily philosophical and deep questions&quot; it asks.;From the Internet Archive.;According to Christian Nutt from Newtype USA, the main attraction to the series is its keen view on &quot;the interlocking problems of identity and technology&quot;. Nutt saluted ABe's &quot;crisp, clean character design&quot; and the &quot;perfect soundtrack&quot; in his 2005 review of series, saying that &quot;''Serial Experiments Lain'' might not yet be considered a true classic, but it's a fascinating evolutionary leap that helped change the future of anime.&quot;;; ''Anime Jump'' gave it 4.5/5,; and Anime on DVD gave it A+ on all criteria for volume 1 and 2, and a mix of A and A+ for volume 3 and 4.;
Image:Serial Experiments Lain (TV) Screenshot 01.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lain's neighborhood. The &quot;blood pools&quot; represent the Wired's presence &quot;beneath the surface&quot; of reality.;
''Lain'' was subject to commentary in the literary and academic worlds. The ''Asian Horror Encyclopedia'' calls it &quot;an outstanding psycho-horror anime about the psychic and spiritual influence of the Internet&quot;.;, page 162.; It notes that the red spots present in all the shadows look like blood pools (see picture). It notes the death of a girl in a train accident is &quot;a source of much ghost lore in the twentieth century&quot;, more so in Tokyo. The ''Anime Essentials'' anthology by Gilles Poitras describes it as a &quot;complex and somehow existential&quot; anime that &quot;pushed the enveloppe&quot; ''(sic)'' of anime diversity in the 1990s, alongside the much better known ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' and ''Cowboy Bebop''.;, page 28.; Professor Susan J. Napier, in her reading to the American Philosophy Society called ''The Problem of Existence in Japanese Animation'', compared ''Serial Experiments Lain'' to ''Ghost in the Shell'' and Hayao Miyazaki's ''Spirited Away''.;''The Problem of Existence in Japanese Animation'', by Pr. Susan J. Napier, in ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', Vol. 149, No. 1, March 2005.; According to her, the main characters of the two other works cross barriers; they can cross back to our world, but Lain cannot. Napier asks whether there is something to which Lain should return, &quot;between an empty 'real' and a dark 'virtual'&quot;. Mitchell Tribbett from Reed College interprets ''Lain'' as a symbol of Japan's post-war social and cultural struggles. In his essay ''Serial Experiments: Lain as a Reflection of Modern Japanese Anxieties in the Digital Era'', Tribbett sees the Wired in ''Lain'' as representative of the westernized, non hierarchical society that co-exists with traditional Japanese culture.;''Serial Experiments: Lain as a Reflection of Modern Japanese Anxieties in the Digital Era'', by Michael Tribett. Anthropology of Japan, Reed College.;

Producer Ueda had to answer repeated queries about a statement made in an Animerica interview.;;;;;; The controversial statement said ''Lain'' was ''&quot;a sort of cultural war against American culture and the American sense of values we ;[Japan]; adopted after World War II&quot;''.;Animerica, (Vol. 7 No. 9, p.29); 
He later explained in numerous interviews that he created ''Lain'' with a set of values he took as distinctly Japanese; he hoped Americans would not understand the series as the Japanese would. This would lead to a &quot;war of ideas&quot; over the meaning of the anime, hopefully culminating in new communication between the two cultures. When he discovered that the American audience held the same views on the series as the Japanese, he was disappointed.;

Publications and other media

The ''Lain'' franchise was originally conceived to connect across forms of media (anime, video games, manga). Producer Yasuyuki Ueda said in an interview, &quot;the approach I took for this project was to communicate the essence of the work by the total sum of many media products.&quot;; The scenario for the video game was written first, and the video game was produced at the same time as the anime series, though the series was released first. A doujinshi named &quot;The Nightmare of Fabrication&quot; was produced by Yoshitoshi ABe and released in Japanese in the artbook ''Omnipresence in The Wired''. Ueda and Konaka declared in an interview that the idea of a multimedia project was not unusual in Japan, as opposed to the contents of ''Lain'', and the way they are exposed.; Several soundtrack CDs have been released.
