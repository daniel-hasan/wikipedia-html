The 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland was a military operation that started without a formal declaration of war on 17 September 1939, during the early stages of World War II, sixteen days after the beginning of the Nazi German attack on Poland. It ended in a decisive victory for the Soviet Union's Red Army.

In early 1939, the Soviet Union tried to form an alliance against Nazi Germany with the United Kingdom, France, Poland, and Romania; but several difficulties arose, including the refusal of Poland and Romania to allow Soviet troops transit rights through their territories as part of collective security.;Anna M.

Prelude
Deployment of Polish divisions on 1 September 1939. The majority of Polish forces were concentrated on the German border; the Soviet border had been mostly stripped of units.

In the late 1930s, the Soviet Union tried to form an anti-German alliance with the United Kingdom, France and Poland. The negotiations, however, proved difficult. The Soviets insisted on a sphere of influence stretching from Finland to Romania and asked for military support not only against anyone who attacked them directly but against anyone who attacked the countries in their proposed sphere of influence.;Shaw, p 119; Neilson, p 298.; They also demanded the right to enter Poland, Romania and the Baltic States whenever they felt their security was threatened. The governments of those countries rejected the proposal because, as Polish foreign minister Józef Beck pointed out, they feared that once the Red Army entered their territories, it might never leave.; The Soviets did not trust the British and French to honour collective security, since they had failed to assist Spain against the Fascists or protect Czechoslovakia from the Nazis. They also suspected that the Western Allies would prefer the Soviet Union to fight Germany by itself, while they watched from the sidelines.;Kenez, pp. 129–31.; In view of these concerns, the Soviet Union abandoned the talks and turned instead to negotiations with Germany.

On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany, taking the allies by surprise. The two governments announced the agreement merely as a non-aggression pact|non-aggression treaty. As a secret appendix reveals, however, they had actually agreed to partition Poland between themselves and divide Eastern Europe into Soviet and German spheres of influence. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which has been described as a license for war, was a key factor in Hitler’s decision to invade Poland.;;Davies, ''Europe: A History'', p. 997.;

Soon after the Germans invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, the Nazi leaders began urging the Soviets to play their agreed part and attack Poland from the east. The German ambassador to Moscow, Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, and the Soviet foreign minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, exchanged a series of diplomatic communiqués on the matter.; The Soviets delayed their intervention for several reasons. They were distracted by crucial events in their Soviet-Japanese Border Wars| border disputes with Japan; they needed time to mobilise the Red Army; and they saw a diplomatic advantage in waiting until Poland had disintegrated before making their move.;Steven J.

Situation after 14 September 1939
Soviet invasion of Poland 17 September 1939 - Polish-Soviet border 
The Red Army entered the eastern regions of Poland with seven field armies and between 450,000 and 1,000,000 troops.; These were deployed on two fronts: the Belarusian Front under Mikhail Kovalyov, and the Ukrainian Front under Semyon Timoshenko.; By this time, the Poles had failed to defend their western borders, and in response to German incursions had launched a major counter-offensive in the Battle of the Bzura. The Polish Army originally had a well-developed Plan Wschód|defensive plan to deal with the threat of the Soviet Union, but they were unprepared to face two invasions at once.;Szubański, ''Plan operacyjny &quot;Wschód&quot;''.; By the time the Soviets invaded, the Polish commanders had sent most of their troops west to face the Germans, leaving the east protected by only 20 under-strength battalions. These battalions consisted of about 20,000 troops of border defence corps (''Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza''), under the command of general Wilhelm Orlik-Rueckemann.;;Sanford, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415338735&amp;id=PZXvUuvfv-oC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;ots=_1tnCiY3_f&amp;dq=Soviet+invasion+of+Poland+1939&amp;sig=WpYsVr5jLk6yIVAYnQqeR3hdXMU p. 20–24.];

Soviet and German officers meet after the Soviet invasion of Poland. From German propaganda newsreel.

At first, the Polish commander-in-chief, Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-Śmigły, ordered the border forces to resist the Soviets. He then changed his mind after consulting with Prime Minister Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski and ordered them to fall back and engage the Soviets only in self-defense.;;Gross, p. 17.; The two conflicting sets of orders led to confusion,; and when the Red Army attacked Polish units, clashes and small battles inevitably broke out.; The response of non-ethnic Poles to the situation added a further complication. In some cases, Ukrainians, Belarusians;Piotrowski, p 199.; and Jews;Gross, pp. 32–33.; welcomed the invading troops as liberators. The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists rose against the Poles, and communist partisans organised local revolts, for example in Skidel.;

The Polish military's original fall-back plan was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian Bridgehead, an area in south-east Poland near the border with Romania. The idea was to adopt defensive positions there and wait for a promised French and British attack in the west. This plan assumed that Germany would have to reduce its operations in Poland in order to fight on a second front.; The allies expected Polish forces to hold out for up to several months, but the Soviet attack made this strategy obsolete.

The Polish political and military leaders knew that they were losing the war against Germany even before the Soviet invasion settled the issue.; Nevertheless, they refused to surrender or negotiate a peace with Germany. Instead, the Polish government ordered all military units to evacuate Poland and reassemble in France.; The government itself crossed into Romania at around midnight on 17 September 1939. Polish units proceeded to manoeuvre towards the Romanian bridgehead area, sustaining German attacks on one flank and occasionally clashing with Soviet troops on the other. In the days following the evacuation order, the Germans defeated the Polish Army Kraków|Armies ''Kraków'' and ''Lublin'' at the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski, which lasted from 17 September to 20 September.;Taylor, p. 38.;

Soviet units often met their German counterparts advancing from the opposite direction. Several notable examples of co-operation occurred between the two armies in the field. The Wehrmacht passed the Brest Fortress, which had been seized after the Battle of Brześć Litewski, to the Soviet 29th Tank Brigade on 17 September.;Benjamin B.

By 28 September, the Red Army had reached the line of the rivers Narew, Western Bug, Vistula and San—the border agreed in advance with the Germans.

Despite a tactical Polish victory on 28 September at the Battle of Szack, the outcome of the larger conflict was never in doubt.; Civilian volunteers, militias, and reorganised retreating units held out in the Polish capital, Warsaw, till 28 September. The Modlin Fortress, north of Warsaw, surrendered the next day after an intense sixteen-day battle. On 1 October, Soviet troops drove Polish units into the forests at the battle of Wytyczno, one of the last direct confrontations of the campaign.;Orlik-Rückemann, p. 20.; Some isolated Polish garrisons managed to hold their positions long after being surrounded; but the last operational unit of the Polish Army to surrender was General Franciszek Kleeberg's ''Independent Operational Group Polesie (Samodzielna Grupa Operacyjna &quot;Polesie&quot;)''. Kleeberg surrendered on 6 October after the four-day Battle of Kock (near Lublin), which ended the September Campaign. The Soviets were victorious. On 31 October, Molotov reported to the Supreme Soviet: &quot;A short blow by the German army, and subsequently by the Red Army, was enough for nothing to be left of this ugly creature of the Treaty of Versailles&quot;.;Moynihan, p. 93; Tucker, p. 612.;

Allied reaction
Rendezvous. David Low's cartoon, published in the ''Evening Standard'' on 20 September 1939, shows Hitler greeting Stalin, following their joint invasion of Poland, with the words, &quot;The scum of the earth, I believe?&quot;. To which Stalin replies, &quot;The bloody assassin of the workers, I presume?&quot;

The reaction of France and Britain to Poland's plight was muted, since neither wanted a confrontation with the Soviet Union at that stage.; Under the terms of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact|Anglo-Polish Agreement of 25 August 1939, the British had promised Poland assistance if attacked by a European power; but when Polish Ambassador Edward Bernard Raczyński|Edward Raczyński remindedForeign Secretary E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax of the pact, he was bluntly told that it was Britain's business whether to declare war on the Soviet Union.; British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain considered making a public commitment to restore Polish statehood, but in the end he issued only general statements of condemnation.;Prazmowska, pp. 44–45.; 

The French had also made promises to Poland, including the provision of air support, and these were not honoured. Once the Soviets moved into Poland, the French and the British decided there was nothing they could do for Poland in the short term and began planning for a long-term victory instead. The French had advanced tentatively into the Saar in early September, but after the Polish defeat, they retreated behind the Maginot Line on 4 October.;Jackson, p. 75.; Many Poles resented this lack of support from their western allies, which aroused a lasting sense ofbetrayal.

On 28 September 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany had changed the secret terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. They moved Lithuania into the Soviet sphere of influence and shifted the border in Poland to the east, giving Germany more territory.; By this arrangement, often described as a fourth partition of Poland,; the Soviet Union secured almost all Polish territory east of the line of the rivers Pisa, Narew, Western Bug and San.

Polish and Jewish citizens may at first have preferred a Soviet regime to a German one.;Gross, pp. 24, 32–33.; However, the Soviets were quick to impose their ideology on the local ways of life.

Small-town residents of Western Byelorussia welcome the Red Army. The Russian text reads &quot;Long Live the great theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin-Stalin&quot;. Such manifestations were not spontaneous, but usually organised by activists of Communist Party of Poland.;

Of the 13.5 million civilians living in the newly annexed territories, Poles were the largest single ethnic group; but Belarusians and Ukrainians together made up over 50% of the population. The annexation did not give the Soviet Union control of all the areas where Belarusians or Ukrainians lived, some of which fell west of the new German–Soviet border. Nonetheless, it united the vast majority of the two peoples within the expanded Soviet Byelorussian and Ukrainian republics.

Vote for the joining of Western Ukraine with Soviet Ukraine, for a united, free and thriving Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Lets forever eliminate the border between Western and Soviet Ukraine. Long Live the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic!&quot;

On 26 October 1939, &quot;elections&quot; to Byelorussian and Ukrainian assemblies were held, to give the annexation an appearance of validity. The Belarusians and Ukrainians in Poland had been increasingly alienated by the Polonization policies of the Polish government and its repression of their separatist movements, so they felt little loyalty towards the Polish state.;Norman Davies, ''Boże Igrzysko'' (God's Playground), vol 2, pp. 512–513.;; Not all Belarusians and Ukrainians, however, trusted the Soviet regime responsible for the Ukrainian Famine of 1932–33.;Davies, ''Europe: A History'', pp. 1001–1003.; In practice, the poor generally welcomed the Soviets, and the elites tended to join the opposition, despite supporting the reunification itself.; Marek Wierzbicki, [http://www.bialorus.pl/index.php?secId=49&amp;docId=60&amp;&amp;Rozdzial=historia ''Stosunki polsko-białoruskie pod okupacją sowiecką (1939–1941)'']. &quot;Białoruskie Zeszyty Historyczne&quot;, Biełaruski histaryczny zbornik, 20 (2003), p. 186–188.

In the process, they ruthlessly broke up political parties and public associations and imprisoned or executed their leaders as &quot;enemies of the people&quot;.;Davies, ''Europe: A History'', pp. 1001–1003.; The authorities even suppressed the anti-Polish Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which had actively resisted the Polish regime since the 1920s; despite their change of overlord, Ukrainian nationalists continued to aim for an independent, undivided Ukrainian state.;Miner, pp. 41–2.;; The unifications of 1939 were nevertheless a decisive event in the history of Ukraine and Belarus, because they produced two republics which eventually achieved independence in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union.;Wilson, p. 17.; Orest Subtelny summed up the historical significance of the Ukrainian reunification:

;Since 1654, when the tsars began steadily to extend their control over Ukraine, Ukrainians had lived in two distinct worlds: one ruled by the Russians and the other by Poles or Austrians. As a result of the Second World War, the East/West Ukrainian dichotomy finally ceased to exist, at least on the political level. The process of amalgamation—of unification of two long-separated branches of the Ukrainian people—was not only a major aspect of the post-war period, but an event of epochal significance in the history of Ukraine.;Subtelny, p. 487.;;

Soviet censors later suppressed many details of the 1939 invasion and its aftermath.;; ; The Politburo had from the first called the operation a &quot;liberation campaign,&quot; and later Soviet statements and publications never wavered from that line.;; On 30 November 1939, Stalin stated that it was not Germany who had attacked France and England but France and England who had attacked Germany;; [http://www.magister.msk.ru/library/stalin/14-25.htm ''Pravda''], 30 November 1939. Retrieved on 2007-07-16.; and the following March, Molotov claimed that Germany had tried to make peace and been turned down by &quot;Anglo-French imperialists.&quot; All subsequent Soviet governments denied that there had ever been a secret protocol to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact; but when the document was &quot;found&quot; in the Soviet archives in 1989, the truth was finally acknowledged.; Censorship was also applied in the People's Republic of Poland, to preserve the image of &quot;Polish-Soviet friendship&quot; promoted by the two communist governments. Official policy allowed only accounts of the 1939 campaign that portrayed it as a reunification of the Belarusian and Ukrainian peoples and a liberation of the Polish people from &quot;oligarchic capitalism.” The authorities strongly discouraged any further study or teaching on the subject.;;;See also: Education in the People's Republic of Poland.; However, various underground publications (''bibuła'') addressed the issue,; as did other media, such as the 1982 protest song of Jacek Kaczmarski (''Ballada wrześniowa.''); [http://www.kaczmarski.art.pl/tworczosc/wiersze_alfabetycznie/kaczmarskiego/b/ballada_wrzsniowa.php ''Ballada wrześniowa''] (September's tale).

Notes
a.Increasing numbers of KOP units, as well as most Polish Army units stationed in the East during peacetime, were sent to the Polish-German border before or during the German invasion. KOP forces guarding the eastern border numbered around 20,000.; On 21 September 1939, an improvised KOP &quot;army&quot; had a strength of 8,700 troops. Polish army units which fought the Soviets had mostly been disrupted and weakened by their retreat from the Germans, making estimates of their strength problematic; it is estimated about 250,000 of such troops found themselves in the line of Soviet advance and offered sporadic resistance.; The total Polish army on 1 September 1939, counting un-mobilised (and sometimes, never mobilised) units, numbered about 950,000.; Historians agree that the vast majority of these forces never saw action against the Soviets.

b. The exact number of people deported in the period 1939–1941 remains unknown, and estimates vary from between 350,000; [http://web.archive.org/web/20050420212451/http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/53025_1.html ''Okupacja Sowiecka W Polsce 1939–41'']. Encyklopedia PWN Retrieved 14 March 2006.; and (old WWII estimates by the Underground) over two million. The first figure is based on NKVD records and does not include the roughly 180,000 prisoners of war in Soviet captivity. Most modern historians estimate the number of all people deported from areas taken by the Soviet Union during this period at between 800,000 and 1,500,000. For example, R. J. Rummel|Rummel estimates the number at 1,200,000 and Kushner and Knox at 1,500,000.;Rummel, p. 132; Kushner, p. 219.; Bernd Wegner quotes Norman Davies's estimate that half of an approximately one million deported Polish citizens were dead by the time the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement was signed in 1941.;Wegner, p. 78.;

The mass deportations were motivated by class warfare—Soviet propaganda hammered home the message that they were fighting a war against barbarism on behalf of civilization—and obsessive security concerns. Less openly admitted advantages of the deportations were the redistribution of deportees' housing and land, the establishment of a back-up labour force prior to the inevitable war with Germany, and the radical alteration of the ethnic demographic of the annexed region.;

c.Among the population of Eastern territories were circa 38% Poles, 37% Ukrainians, 14.5% Belarusians, 8.4% Jewish, 0.9% Russians and 0.6% Germans.;Trela-Mazur, p. 294.;

d.Estonia and Latvia were placed in the Soviet sphere of influence and Lithuania in the German. According to Joachim von Ribbentrop, Germany had agreed to what Britain had refused: a free hand in the Baltic and a free hand in the Balkan states. On 28 September, the border was redefined by adding the area between the Vistula and Bug to the German sphere and moving Lithuania into the Soviet sphere.;Sanford, p. 21; Weinberg, p. 963.;

e.&quot;Polish specialists claim up to 3000 killed and 8,000–10,000 wounded.&quot;;Sanford, p 23.;

f.On 7 September 1939, Stalin told the secretary general of the Comintern, Georgi Dimitrov: &quot;War is going on between two groups of capitalist countries...for the division of the world, for domination of the entire world. We are not against their tearing one another to pieces and weakening one another.&quot; He called Poland a fascist state which had oppressed Ukrainians, Byelorussians and others, and stressed that &quot;the liquidisation of this government under present conditions would mean one fascist government less. It wouldn’t be so bad if as a result of the destruction of Poland we extended the socialist system to new territories and populations.&quot;;Rieber, p. 29.;

g.The Soviets in effect repudiated the Polish-Soviet Riga Peace Treaty|Riga Peace Treaty and the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. They also violated the 1919 Covenant of the League of Nations (to which the USSR subscribed in 1934), the Briand-Kellog Pact of 1928 and the 1933 London Convention on the Definition of Aggression.;Piotrowski, p. 295.;

h.&quot;The USSR proposed a ten-year Anglo-French-Soviet alliance which would include Rumania and Poland.&quot;;Gronowicz, p. 51.;

i.The voters had a choice of only one candidate for each position of deputy; the communist party commissars then provided the assemblies with resolutions that would push through nationalization of banks and heavy industry and transfers of land to peasant communities.;Rieber, pp. 29–30.;

j.For other examples, described by an officer witness, see: Bronisław Konieczny, in ''Mój wrzesień 1939. Pamiętnik z kampanii wrześniowej spisany w obozie jenieckim'' and ''Moje życie w mundurze. Czasy narodzin i upadku II RP''.

k.The &quot;Agreement of Mutual Assistance between the United Kingdom and Poland&quot; (London, 25 August 1939) states in Article 1: &quot;Should one of the Contracting Parties become engaged in hostilities with a European Power in consequence of aggression by the latter against that Contracting Party, the other Contracting Party will at once give the Contracting Party engaged in hostilities all the support and assistance in its power.&quot;;Stachura, p.125.;

l.Some Ukrainians and Belarusians lived in the areas traded to Germany by the Soviets in the agreement of 28 October. For example, Chełm and Lemkivshchyna (Łemkowszczyzna), both with significant Ukrainian populations, were among the Ukrainian enclaves left in German-occupied Poland (see maps).

m.&quot;How are we ... to explain the phenomenon of Ukrainians rejoicing and collaborating with the Soviets? Who were these Ukrainians? That they were Ukrainians is certain, but were they communists, Nationalists, unattached peasants? The answer is &quot;yes—they were all three&quot;.;Piotrowski, p.199.;

n.&quot;The Soviet Union's invasion and occupation of Eastern Poland in September 1939 was a clear act of aggression in international law...But the Soviets did not declare war, nor did the Poles respond with a declaration of war. As a result there was confusion over the status of soldiers taken captive and whether they qualified for treatment as PoWs. Jurists consider that the absence of a formal declaration of war does not absolve a power from the obligations of civilised conduct towards PoWs. On the contrary, failure to do so makes those involved, both leaders and operational subordinates, liable to charges of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity.&quot;;Sanford, p 39, 22–3.;

o.&quot;It is generally known, however, that the British and French governments turned down German peace efforts, made public by her already at the end of last year, which for its part, owed to preparations to escalate the war.&quot; Vyacheslav Molotov, 29 March 1940.;Molotov, V.M., [http://www.histdoc.net/history/molotov.html Report On The Foreign Policy Of The Government], 29 March 1940.
