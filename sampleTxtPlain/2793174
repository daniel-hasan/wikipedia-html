&quot;Can I Have It like That&quot; is a pop rap song performed by rapper Pharrell Williams featuring Gwen Stefani.It was written and produced by Williams for his 2006 debut album ''In My Mind'', and the song is the opening track.The song's hook comes from a one-line contribution from Stefani, used as part of a call and response in the chorus.The song received generally negative reviews from music critics.

&quot;Can I Have It like That&quot; was released as the album's lead single in October 2005 (see 2005 in music).It was commercially unsuccessful in the United States, but fared somewhat better worldwide.A rock remix of the song featured Travis Barker playing the drums and Pharrell playing the guitar.

Background and composition
P. Diddy was originally designated to use the track that Williams created.Several other artists were also interested in using it, but Williams changed his mind and decided to use the song himself.;Bainbridge, Luke.[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,1607765,00.html &quot;Just Williams&quot;].''The Observer''.November 6, 2005.Retrieved October 17, 2007.;In mid 2005, he worked with Stefani in Miami, Florida on her second solo album ''The Sweet Escape'' (2006).While she was in the booth recording &quot;Breakin' Up&quot;, he told her that he had a song he thought would be his first single.Stefani asked to hear it, and he said that he wanted to record her for the track after the two finished working on &quot;Breakin' Up&quot;.Stefani, however, insisted that they work on &quot;Can I Have It like That&quot; then, and Williams recorded her performing the song's hook.;Reid, Shaheem and Bland, Bridget.[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1513788/20051115/williams__pharrell.jhtml &quot;Pharrell Had To Be Sneaky To Record His Solo Album&quot;].MTV News.November 15, 2005.Retrieved October 17, 2007.;She contributed one line, which she performed twice, to the song.;Vineyard, Jennifer.[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1511456/20051013/williams__pharrell.jhtml &quot;Pharrell 'Can't Complain' About Lady Leopards; Gwen Moons Over Him On Video Set&quot;].MTV News.November 11, 2005.Retrieved October 17, 2007.;

Critical reception
&quot;Can I Have It like That&quot; received generally negative reviews from music critics.Josh Tyrangiel of ''Entertainment Weekly'' called it an &quot;odd opener&quot; to ''In My Mind'' and remarked that Williams &quot;never commits to putting his hips into it&quot;, leaving the track without any climax.;''The Observer'';'s; Luke Bainbridge, however, referred to the song as &quot;a grinding instant smash&quot;.;Bainbridge, Luke.[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/reviews/story/0,13875,1590569,00.html &quot;Pharrell Williams, In My Mind&quot;].''The Observer''.October 16, 2005.Retrieved October 23, 2007.;For IGN, Spence Abbott described Williams' rapping as &quot;a little sticky, but…ruggedly appealing in a manner of speaking&quot;, and commented that &quot;it's the shuffling and infectious beat…that will have you swerving and slinking like a cobra with epilepsy.&quot;;In his review for ''Slant Magazine'', Preston Jones characterized the song as &quot;curiously inert&quot;, adding that it sounded better as a sample on Girl Talk's 2006 mashup album ''Night Ripper''.;Jones, Preston.[http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=913 &quot;Music Review: Pharrell: ''In My Mind''&quot;].''Slant Magazine''.2006.Retrieved October 23, 2007.;

Music video
Stefani and Williams performing in front of a sort of equalizer.

The song's music video was directed by Paul Hunter.It depicts Williams being watched by a secret organization.Aware that he is being watched, he talks to a woman, revealed to be Stefani, on the phone.He makes appearances at an exclusive boat party and at another party in his penthouse.;Vineyard, Jennifer.[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1510483/20050927/williams__pharrell.jhtml &quot;Pharrell's Got Naked Women, Fireballs And, Oh Yeah, Gwen Stefani For Clip&quot;].MTV News.September 27, 2005.Retrieved October 18, 2007.;There are intercut sequences of people including Williams and Stefani dancing in front of a large equalizer, Williams standing in front of explosions, and people skateboarding.;

The music video was filmed in late September 2005.The cinematography is designed so that the music video becomes the secret organization's surveillance of Williams.It uses shifting camera angles to create tension.;The scenes in front of the equalizer were filmed in front of a greenscreen, and the explosion sequences were shot live on the streets of Los Angeles, California.In the penthouse scene, he is accompanied by two naked women with leopard-pattern body paint and a baby cougar.Hunter came up with the idea of showing body-painted women, and Williams suggested sitting with the cougar because he &quot;wanted to exude power.&quot;;

The video had little success on video chart programs.To date, it is Williams' only video as a main artist to debut on MTV's ''Total Request Live''.;[http://www.atrl.net/trlarchive/?s=debuts &quot;The TRL Archive - Debuts&quot;].ATRL.Retrieved October 19, 2007.;It was on the program's countdown for three days, reaching number nine.;[http://www.atrl.net/trlarchive/?s=recap&amp;y=2005&amp;m=10 &quot;The TRL Archive - Recap - October 2005&quot;].ATRL.Retrieved October 23, 2007.;The video was unable to make MuchMusic's ''Countdown''.;[http://www.muchmusic.com/tv/countdown/ &quot;MuchMusic Countdown&quot;].MuchMusic.Retrieved October 19, 2007.;
