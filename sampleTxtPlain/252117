Tenacious D, or &quot;The D&quot; as they are also known by fans,;; is an American satirical rock band duo composed of musician/actors Kyle Gass and Jack Black.;; Their music fuses vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music in a style that critics have described as &quot;mock rock&quot;.;;;

Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocals and Gass' acoustic guitar playing abilities. Many of their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and intakeof cannabis. Their albums feature absurd and humorous sketches. Music critics have compared the storyteller-style lyrics of their songs to lyrics of rock opera.;;;; 

The band first gained popularity in 1999 when they starred in the self-titled ''Tenacious D'', a television series on HBO, in which Black and Gass attempted to establish themselves as the &quot;Greatest Band on Earth&quot;.; The series airs occasionally on Comedy Central and is available on their DVD, ''The Complete Masterworks''. In addition, they have since recorded two albums, and starred in their own movie, ''Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny''.

History
=Beginnings=

Black and Gass, at the time respectively aged 16 and 24, met in Edinburgh, Scotland during the Edinburgh Fringe. Both at the time were members of the Los Angeles-based theatre troupe, The Actors' Gang.;;;; While Gass initially felt threatened by Black, they eventually worked out their differences, and formed a band.;;

The band's name was derived from a term used by sports commentator Marv Albert about the tenacious defense of the NBA's New York Knicks.;; The name was decided by the audience of the band's first live show, in 1994 at the now defunct Al's Bar. Other possibilities had included &quot;Pets or Meat&quot;, &quot;Balboa’s Biblical Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Axe Lords Featuring Gorgazon’s Mischief&quot;, which Gass described as being his personal favorite.;;;; Attending that performance was David Cross; the performance led him to cast Tenacious D in his sketch comedy television series, ''Mr. Show''.;;;

While they can both sing and play the guitar &amp;ndash; Gass taught Black to play in exchange for Black's helping him with his acting &amp;ndash; Black is billed as lead singer and Gass as lead guitarist.;;

=Friendship=

In an interview on BBC Radio 1 aired on January 18, 2006, with Colin Murray, Gass described Black as one of his best friends, adding that he is the godfather of Black’s son: Samuel Jason.;; In an interview with ''High Times'', Gass described his relationship with Black as being &quot;pretty organic&quot;, and described Black as being &quot;meaner&quot; on stage.;; In the same interview, Black posits that &quot;pain and exile&quot; were what brought the duo together.;; When Gass was asked whether he felt jealously towards Black's film career in relation to his own, he responded: &quot;If you're really friends with someone, you want them to be as successful as possible. And it hasn't hurt the band — it's helped us.&quot;;; When asked if he and Black had fall outs, Gass replied &quot;we still have our disagreements&quot;, adding &quot;I think the fact that we do a lot of stuff outside The D helps to recharge the batteries and is kinda fun, so when we get together it’s great again.&quot;;;

=Television series (1997 – 2000)=

''Tenacious D'' premiered in 1997, immediately following an episode of ''Mr. Show''. While a total of six episodes, ten- to twelve-minutes in length, were produced, only the first two were aired that year; the final four episodes did not air until the summer of 2000.;; Although the show heavily featured Tenacious D songs, the tone and content of the series was very much shaped by collaborators Bob Odenkirk, David Cross, and director Tom Gianas. The show dealt with the trials and tribulations of a band trying to make it in the music business. Many songs that eventually were included on the band's first album were first featured on the show, though the episodes also contain songs that remain unreleased. 

The six episodes were titled &quot;The Search for Inspirado&quot;, &quot;Angel in Disguise&quot;, &quot;Death of a Dream&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Song in the World&quot;, &quot;The Fan&quot;, and &quot;Road Gig&quot;. ; After the series aired, the band continued to perform. At a show at the Viper Room in Los Angeles, they met Dave Grohl, who remarked that he was impressed with their performance;;;;; this led to their cameo in the Foo Fighters' &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; music video.;; The popularity of Tenacious D further increased as they began to open for high profile acts, including Beck, Pearl Jam, and Foo Fighters.;

=First album (2001 &amp;ndash; 2003)=

''Tenacious D'', the band's eponymous first album, was released in 2001, and reached number thirty-three on the ''Billboard'' 200 on October 132001.;;;; While Tenacious D usually appears as a duo, the album was backed by a full band, consisting of Dave Grohl on drums and guitar, keyboardist Page McConnell of Phish, guitarist Warren Fitzgerald of The Vandals, and bassist Steven Shane McDonald of Redd Kross. According to Black, they chose to use a band because &quot;no one's ever heard us with a band&quot;.;; The majority of the songs on the album, which was produced by the Dust Brothers,; were performed previously on their short-lived HBO television series.;;



Although the critical reaction to the album was varied,;RIAA certifications [http://www.riaa.com/ Recording Industry Association of America] Accessed 31 January 2007; by 8 November, 2005, it had achieved platinum status in the US. ''Entertainment Weekly'' described the release as being &quot;hilarious&quot;, and &quot;no mere comedy record&quot;.;; ''All Music Guide'' wrote that the album &quot;rocks so damn hard&quot;, but lamented the absence of some of the songs from the television show.;; ''Splendid magazine'' remarked that &quot;as entertainment, Tenacious D succeeds surprisingly well -- for the first few listens.... The only long-term replay value you'll get from this record will come from playing it for friends who haven't heard it.&quot;;;

;
The first single from the album was &quot;Tribute&quot; &amp;mdash; a tribute to the &quot;greatest and best song in the world&quot; which, in the song, Tenacious D claimed they had performed in order to save their souls from a Demon. The music video for this song was directed by Liam Lynch, and features Dave Grohl as the demon, along with cameos by Jason Reed, Ben Stiller and Lynch himself. This was followed by the second single, &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, the music video of which was directed by Spike Jonze.

Two follow-up singles were released from the album. &quot;Dio&quot; was written as a tribute to the rock singer Ronnie James Dio, and mocked him somewhat for being too old, and asked for him to stop playing rock music and &quot;pass the torch&quot; to Tenacious D. Dio liked the song enough to let the band appear in the music video for his song, &quot;Push&quot;. The music video for &quot;Fuck Her Gently&quot; was animated by Spümcø leader John Kricfalusi, the creator of ''Ren and Stimpy''. An EP entitled ''D Fun Pak'' was released in 2002. It featured a skit and acoustic versions of &quot;Jesus Ranch&quot; and &quot;Kyle Quit The Band&quot;, as well as a megamix by Mocean Worker. The CD was available free with the album or sold separately.;; ''The Complete Masterworks'', a music DVD featuring the entire run of their TV series, music videos, and a live performance from London's Brixton Academy recorded on November 32002, was released in 2003.;;

=''The Pick of Destiny'' (2004 &amp;ndash; Present)=

In July 2004, the band started production on their film, ''Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny''. Filming was delayed by almost a year due to Black being cast in Peter Jackson's big budget remake of ''King Kong'', which was shot in New Zealand. While on location, Black continued to work on preproduction for the Tenacious D film and shooting for ''The Pick of Destiny'' started in July 2005 with director Liam Lynch,;; who had previously directed the band's &quot;Tribute&quot; music video. Two months earlier, in May 2005, the band started recording songs for the soundtrack of the movie, which is their second studio album, ''The Pick of Destiny''.;; The second Tenacious D album had John Konesky on lead electric guitar and John Spiker on bass and backing vocals. Dave Grohl was once again called to be the drummer, and further lent vocals to &quot;Beelzeboss (The Final Showdown)&quot; as well as acting in the film, reprising the role that he played in the ''Tribute'' video as the Demon.



''The Pick of Destiny'' is a fictional portrayal of the beginnings of the band and their rise to super-stardom. It was released on November 22, 2006 and debuted in 11th place during Thanksgiving weekend, being overshadowed by other comedies such as Borat and Deck the Halls.;; The soundtrack was released just over a week earlier, on November 14, and reached number eight on the Billboard 200 in the U.S.,;; number twenty-four in the UK,;; and number fifty-seven in the US.;;

The film, which opened to poor box office results, was released on November 22, 2006 and, as of December 17, 2006, has earned US$8,334,575 domestically,;; making it the 151st highest grossing film of 2006.;; The film has earned a worldwide total of $13,363,336.;; It opened in 11th place for both the standard three day weekend as well as the five day Thanksgiving weekend, followed by a 15th place performance the following week.;;

''Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny'' was released on DVD on February 27, 2007. It features many scenes cut from the cinema release of the movie,;; and an &quot;In the Studio&quot; documentary, as appeared in ''The Complete Masterworks''.;;

To coincide with the release of their new movie and album, Tenacious D embarked on their Tenacious D's 2006-07 Tour|2006&amp;ndash;07 tour of the U.S., Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand.This tour, which stopped mainly in small theaters, included the band's first headlining date at a major arena, New York City's Madison Square Garden. Black has said that the band has lost money on the tour due to the cost of touring with a full band for the first time.;;;;Both hometown concerts at the Gibson Amphitheatre were undersold.The band heavily promoted the album and film by performing on the daytime and late night talk show circuit, and appearing on the American Music Awards and ''Saturday Night Live''.While Tenacious D had performed on ''Saturday Night Live'' in the past (usually when Black was the host), this was the first time the band was the musical guest.

In an interview from November 2006, Gass hinted a desire for Tenacious D to end at their current highpoint,though it is possible that he could have been joking; in the same interview, Jack Black expressed wishes to take a year-long break from acting.;; A third studio album has neither been announced nor ruled out.

Appearances
=Film and television=
Black and Gass first appeared performing together in ''Bio-Dome'' (1996), followed by ''The Cable Guy'' (1996), ''Cradle Will Rock'' (1999), ''Saving Silverman'' (2001) and ''Shallow Hal'' (2001), although in none of these appearances were they performing as Tenacious D. ''Bongwater'' (1997) featured Black, as his character Devlin, performing &quot;Jesus Ranch&quot;, which was featured in an episode of their TV series. Black has starred in a number of films himself including ''High Fidelity'', ''School of Rock'' and ''King Kong''. In 2006, Tenacious D starred in their own movie, ''Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny'', in which they set out to become the greatest rock band in the world, by means of a guitar pick with magical powers.

Black and Gass have made several television appearances performing songs from their first album. In June 16, 2001, Tenacious D were featured as puppets performing &quot;Friendship&quot; on an episode of ''Crank Yankers''. In April 27, 2002 they guest starred on ''MADtv'' playing the song &quot;Tribute&quot; with Foo Fighters vocalist Dave Grohl on drums. Later, Tenacious D made an appearance in the first episode of ''Tom Goes to the Mayor'' to be televised on Adult Swim.In the episode, they were known as &quot;The Bear Trap Brothers,&quot; two competitive brothers who ran bear trap shops that were located side-by-side. The band appeared in musical promotional clips on MTV during the week before the premiere of ''The Osbournes''. The two musical shorts featured Black and Gass dressed in stereotypical rock outfits. These appearances were featured on ''Tenacious D - The Complete Masterworks|The Complete Masterworks'' as an easter egg.

In the run up to the release of ''The Pick of Destiny'' film, Tenacious D made several appearances performing the &quot;Pick of Destiny&quot; song, including at the 2006 American Music Awards on 11 November, 2006 and on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien''. On 2 December, 2006, Tenacious D was the musical guest on ''Saturday Night Live'' for the first time.;; They opened the 2006 Spike TV Video Game Awards, with a performance of &quot;The Metal&quot;.;;

The song &quot;The Metal&quot; from The Pick of Destiny is featured in the video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, in the sixth set titled &quot;The Hottest Band On Earth,&quot; likely a reference to Tenacious D's running joke of being the greatest band in the world.

= Tours=
Tenacious D 'playing' the Sax-a-boom live.
Tenacious D started their second nationwide concert tour in 2001, playing at bigger venues, many of which sold out.; Until 2006, Tenacious D usually performed only with acoustic guitars and rarely performed with a full band. Tenacious D has staged two international concert tours, and numerous domestic tours,;; though they have rarely played in non-English speaking countries. Black says this is because foreign concerts are &quot;a little funky&quot; because &quot;the subtleties do get lost in translation&quot;.; In addition, he comments of the angst they experience before concerts saying: &quot;We're always looking for a loophole. Pretty much every concert we've ever done, we're trying to find a way to cancel the show at the last minute.&quot;;

=Guest appearances=

Gass performs lead acoustic guitar and vocals for the band Trainwreck, under the pseudonym &quot;Klip Calhoun&quot;. Trainwreck features the actor who plays Lee, Jason &quot;JR&quot; Reed, under the pseudonym &quot;Darryl Donald&quot;, and Black occasionally appears using the name &quot;Tuffy McFuckelby&quot;.;; John Konesky and John Spiker, lead guitar and bass, respectively, on ''The Pick of Destiny'' album, are also in the band.

Tenacious D have appeared in numerous music videos by other bands, including &quot;Push&quot; by Dio and &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; by the Foo Fighters. Gass appeared in the Good Charlotte music video for the song &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;. Black has appeared in many music videos on his own including a cameo alongside Dave Grohl in the music video for the Eagles of Death Metal song &quot;I Want You So Hard (Boy's Bad News)&quot;, alongside Dave Grohl again in the music video for &quot;Low&quot;, and a cameo in the music video for the song &quot;Sexx Laws&quot; by Beck.;;

Both Black and Gass sang backup vocals on the 2002 Styx album ''Cyclorama'' song &quot;Kiss Your Ass Goodbye&quot;.;; Tenacious D lent backing vocals to The Vandals album ''Look What I Almost Stepped In...'' in the song &quot;Fourteen&quot;.

Influences

Black has said that the first song he enjoyed was ABBA's &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot;.;; He attributes influences from Dio,;; Black Sabbath;;;; and Meat Loaf.;; Gass describes their influences as being derived from &quot;big dinosaurs of rock&quot; such as Led Zeppelin.;; In addition, Gass lists his influences as being Tom Waits, Tony Hawk and Tony Robbins.;; The band claimed that the inspiration for the song ''Tribute'' came after Black played Metallica's &quot;One&quot; for Gass, describing it as &quot;the best song in the world&quot;,;;;; leading to a failed attempt to themselves write an even better song.

Gass has described Tenacious D's comic assertion that they are the best band as being &quot;ridiculous because it's a matter of opinion&quot;.;; Black characterizes Tenacious D's comic nature as an antidote to &quot;the masculinity of rock&quot;, adding &quot;There's also something funny about the macho-ness of rock. Like the bands that are the fucking hardest rocking are like, 'We'll fucking kick your ass, dude... with our rock.'&quot;;;

Politics

Tenacious D are supporters of cannabis legalization,;; and state their views on it in the song &quot;City Hall&quot;,;; describing those who blocked its legalization as &quot;shrivs&quot;.;[http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/City-Hall-lyrics-Tenacious-D/40CB0DF23822BD2548256B7200087376 ''City Hall'' lyrics]; According to Black and Gass, ''Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny'' features them intoxicated on cannabis during the last scene.;;;; In an interview, Black described his view that if drug use was legalized, the stigma attached to the users &amp;mdash; making them in his words feel &quot;naughty&quot;, would be removed which would make drug use seem mundane.;; Black was the executive producer for a documentary about Randy Credico entitled ''Sixty Spins Around the Sun''. It calls for the so-called Rockefeller drug laws to be repealed. Black said of it &quot;They're populating our prisons with people, you know, first-time drug offenders -- Single mothers that have a little bit of coke end up going to prison for 20 years or something. It's just cruel and unusual punishment.&quot;;;

In 2004, Tenacious D supported John Kerry during the United States presidential election, by playing a benefit concert for him.; In addition, in an interview with ''The Observer'', Black is described as being a &quot;prominent Democrat [sic] party supporter&quot;.;; In an interview with Dave Grohl, Black discussed his views on George W. Bush: &quot;I don't read the newspaper; I just look at the news on Yahoo! Gore was ripping Bush today and it was kind of awesome, even though it's weird to talk shit about Bush, because in these tender, terrorist times, we're supposed to support him no matter what the fuck lame shit he does.&quot;;;

Black said the Iraq War &quot;felt so wrong&quot;, since, in his words, it had &quot;nothing to do with Osama bin Laden&quot;.;; Gass said of the state of the U.S. administration: &quot;It’s a bad time for the U.S. government&quot;, and had expressed surprise that Tony Blair was still the Prime Minister of the UK.;;
