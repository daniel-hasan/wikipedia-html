The Battle of Stillman's Run, also known as the Battle of Sycamore Creek or the Battle of Old Man's Creek, occurred on May 14 1832. The battle was named for Major Isaiah Stillman and his detachment of 275 Illinois militia which fled in a panic from around 50 of Sauk warriors. The engagement was the first battle of the 1832 Black Hawk War which had ignited after Black Hawk crossed the Mississippi River into Illinois with his &quot;British Band&quot; of Sauk and Fox. Following a failed attempt at truce negotiations by emissaries sent by Black Hawk, the disorganized militia pursued a group of Sauk scouts back to the main British Band camp. 

During the engagement 12 militia men were killed while making a stand on a small hill. The rest of the militia fled back to Dixon's Ferry where they spread news of a terrible slaughter at Stillman's Run. It is believed that militia volunteer Abraham Lincoln helped bury the dead at the battlefield following the fight, this claim, however, was still under investigation as of 2003. An article published in 2006 corroborated Lincoln's presence at the burial; though there is little agreement amongst various other sources. In 1901 a monument was erected in Stillman Valley, Illinois commemorating the battle.

Background
Angered by the loss of his birthplace via prior disputed treaties, Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River beginning in 1830. Each time, he was persuaded to return west without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliances with other tribes and the British, he again moved his &quot;British Band&quot;;The group was referred to as the &quot;British Band&quot;, because of their earlier support to the British during the War of 1812 and continued reliance on British trade.

The conflict became known as the Black Hawk War.

On April 5, 1832, Black Hawk and around 1,000 warriors and civilians recrossed the Mississippi River into Illinois in an attempt to reclaim their land. About half of Black Hawk's band were combatants and the rest were a combination of women, children, and elderly. The band consisted of Sauk, Fox, some Potawatomi, and some Kickapoo; in addition some members of the Ho-Chunk nation were sympathetic to Black Hawk.;Lewis, James. &quot;[http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/scholarshipindex.html Introduction],&quot; The Black Hawk War of 1832, Abraham Lincoln Digitization Project, ''Northern Illinois University''.

Prelude
Atkinson was not informed of Governor Reynolds' decision to order Major Isaiah Stillman's militia to march on Old Man's Creek, despite being in overall command. The orders themselves were vague. Stillman's orders were written under General Samuel Whiteside's name and in Reynolds' hand.;Dyar, Scott D. &quot;Stillman's Run: Militia's Foulest Hour,&quot; Military History, March 2006, pp. 38-44, 72.; In fact, Whiteside had refused to accept Stillman's battalion under his command, thus leaving it &quot;orphaned&quot; and under the direct command of Reynolds.;Miller, Richard Lawrence.

Prior to the battle at Stillman's Run, Black Hawk's grand vision of British support, and an Native American confederacy had collapsed.; There would be no one to aid him or his followers. The British Band started to weaken with hunger, and Black Hawk soon realized that the only option was to return back across the Mississippi River. When he detected the U.S. militia camp eight miles (13 km) away, Black Hawk sent out peace envoys in order to negotiate a truce, they were told to wave a white flag at the militia.;

275 militia under the command of Isaiah Stillman fled Black Hawk warriors at what became known as Stillman's Run.
On May 14, 1832, a detachment of 275 militia under the command of Majors Isaiah Stillman and David Bailey, under vague orders from Illinois Governor Reynolds, were encamped near Old Man's Creek, not far from its confluence with the Rock River.;;Braun, Robert A. &quot;[http://www.geocities.com/old_lead/bhwchron.htm Black Hawk's War April 5 - August 2, 1832: A Chronology],&quot; September 2001, ''Old Lead Historical Society''.

Black Hawk, in conference with the local Potawatomi, learned of Stillman's presence and sent three emissaries to the militia camp under a flag of parley in order to negotiate a peace with the soldiers.;Lewis, James A. &quot;[http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2a.html The Black Hawk War of 1832],&quot; Abraham Lincoln Digitization Project, ''Northern Illinois University'', p. 2A.

Lincoln's role
This image has been claimed as the earliest of Abraham Lincoln and dates to around 1847, 15 years after the war.
Abraham Lincoln's service during the Black Hawk War has been a source of discrepancies and questioning, with two major battle sites, including Stillman's Run, being affiliated with Lincoln in the aftermath of combat. A number of sources assert that on June 26, 1832, the morning after the Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at Kellogg's Grove to help bury the dead. One of the soldiers in the company was Lincoln. Lincoln assisted with the burial and later made a statement about the experience that has been connected with both the battle at Kellogg's Grove and the fight at Stillman's Run.;Dameier, Evelyn. &quot;[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/200106.pdf Kellogg's Grove],&quot; (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, 18 January 1978, HAARGIS Database, ''Illinois Historic Preservation Agency''.

Inscription on the monument in Stillman Valley concerning Lincoln's role in the aftermath of the battle.
Lincoln made a humorous remark during an 1848 speech before the U.S. Congress in which he referenced his Black Hawk War service, mentioning Stillman's Run by name.



The marble facade on the Stillman Valley monument, erected in 1901, commemorating the battle, includes the reference to Lincoln's presence at Stillman's Run, &quot;The presence of soldier, statesman, martyr, Abraham Lincoln assisting in the burial of these honored dead has made this spot more sacred.&quot;;
Still, other sources assert that it was General Whiteside who originally buried the dead in a common grave on a ridge south of the battlefield, marked with a rudimentary wooden memorial.

Aftermath
Monument and graves located in Stillman Valley
Following the first confrontation at Stillman Valley, the exaggerated claim that 2,000 &quot;bloodthirsty warriors were sweeping all Northern Illinois with the bosom of destruction&quot; sent shock waves of terror through the region.;&quot;[http://www.il.ngb.army.mil/Museum/HistoricalEvents/Blackhawk.htm Black Hawk War],&quot; Historical Events, ''Illinois State Military Museum''. Retrieved 6 August 2007.; Past midnight on May 15 soldiers from Stillman's ill-fated detachment began streaming back into Dixon's Ferry, wide-eyed and panic-stricken, telling tales of a horrible slaughter that had ensued during the battle. In the immediate aftermath of the battle 53 militia men were missing, though it was later determined that the majority of those had simply passed Dixon's Ferry by on their way home.;

After this initial skirmish, Black Hawk led many of the civilians in his band to the Michigan Territory.; On 19 May, the militia traveled up the Rock River trailing and searching for Black Hawk and his band.; Several small skirmishes and massacres ensued over the next month in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin before the milita was able to regain public confidence in battles at Bloody Lake and Waddams Grove.;&quot;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/diary/002869.asp James Stephenson Describes the Battle at Yellow Creek], Historic Diaries: The Black Hawk War, ''Wisconsin Historical Society''.

The debacle at Stillman' Run added fuel to the fire for critics of the Illinois Militia, mostly members of the Regular Army. Critics began, almost immediately, to refer to the battle at Old Man's Creek as the Battle of Stillman's Run, because Stillman had apparently fled with the panicked militia.;
