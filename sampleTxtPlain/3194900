U.S. Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease, CDC 

Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease is a leading infectious cause of morbidity and mortality among newborns.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) bacteria can be passed from a pregnant woman who is a carrier of the bacteria to her baby during labor. Since the bacteria can come and go, testing for GBS is needed every pregnancy. Toward the end of a pregnancy, the vagina and rectum are cultured with a swab at a prenatal appointment. Women with GBS are given an antibiotic during labor. Evidence based research studies show that using this test can reduce infant infections. ; [http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5111a1.htm#tab2 U.S. Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease, CDC];
