Mike Stock (born September 29, 1949) is one of the most experienced coaches in National Football League history. With 41 combined seasons on coaching staffs at the pro and college levels, he joins the Packers from the St. Louis Rams, where he spent one year (2004). 

At the professional level, Stock has coached 16 years in the NFL and one campaign in the USFL. He helped the Bengals to a Super Bowl during six seasons in Cincinnati, first as special teams coach (1986-88) and later as wide receivers coach (1989-90) and tight ends coach (1991). 

Marty Schottenheimer brought him to Kansas City to coach special teams (1995-2000). After the 1997 season, when the Chiefs finished second overall in the Dallas Morning News rankings, Stock earned Special Teams Coach of the Year honors in a vote of his peers. From 2001-03, he presided over the Washington Redskins' special teams before heading to St. Louis. 

Two decades earlier, in 1983, he coached the offensive backfield of the New Jersey Generals, a franchise that featured the USFL's leading rusher, rookie Herschel Walker. 

After the USFL's 1983 spring season, Stock rejoined Notre Dame as wide receivers coach and recruiting coordinator, continuing a college coaching tenure that includes stops at seven institutions and 24 years in all. That tenure began at his alma mater, Northwestern, where Ara Parseghian gave him his first coaching job as a graduate assistant in 1961. From there, Stock coached the freshman team at the University of Buffalo (1966-67), wide receivers/offensive backfield at Navy (1968), and the freshmen (1969) and wide receivers (1970-74) in his first stint at Notre Dame. 

This marks Stock's second coaching position in Wisconsin. He served as the University of Wisconsin's offensive coordinator from 1976-77, then advanced to Eastern Michigan as head coach (1978-82) before returning to Notre Dame as wide receivers coach and recruiting coordinator (1983-85), and running backs coach (1986). He closed his distinguished college coaching career at Ohio State, where he tutored wide receivers from 1992-94. 

A former fullback for Parseghian at Northwestern, Stock led the Wildcats in rushing from 1959-60. After returning from the U.S. Army in 1965, Stock spent one year as an assistant at Akron (Ohio) South High School before restarting his college career in 1966. He is a native of Barberton, Ohio. He and his wife Peggy have three children, Michael, Patrick and Cindy.
