Tel Yodfat from west
Yodfat (), is a non-religious Jewish moshav located in the vicinity of the Atzmon mountain ridge north of the Beit Netofa Valley in the Galilee, south of Carmiel and within the municipal territory of the Misgav Regional Council in Israel. The moshav, named after the nearby Second Temple-era Judean city of the same name (in Hebrew), Jotapata, was founded in 1958 by a group of graduates of the Hebrew Reali School of Haifa. Over the years, families from North America and England also joined this group.
