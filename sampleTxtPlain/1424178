''The Simpsons Movie'' is a 2007 American animated comedy film based on the animated television series ''The Simpsons''. The film was directed by David Silverman, produced by James L. Brooks, Matt Groening, Al Jean, Mike Scully, and Richard Sakai, and written by Scully, Jean, Brooks, Groening, George Meyer, David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, Ian Maxtone-Graham, and Matt Selman. It stars the regular television cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Tress MacNeille and Pamela Hayden and features Albert Brooks in a prominent guest role, as well as Tom Hanks and Green Day in smaller ones.

After previous attempts to create a film version of ''The Simpsons'' had failed because of script length and lack of staff, production began in 2001. The writers conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening’s being the one developed into a film. The script was re-written over one hundred times continuing after animation had begun. This meant that hours of finished material was cut, including cameos from Isla Fisher, Minnie Driver, Erin Brockovich, Edward Norton and Kelsey Grammer. Tie-in promotions were made with several companies, including Burger King and 7-Eleven, which Kwik-E-Mart#7-Eleven promotion|transformed select stores into Kwik-E-Marts. The film premiered in Springfield, Vermont, which won the right to hold it through a Fox competition. The film was a box office success, and received overall positive reception from film critics.

Plot
;
Green Day is performing on Lake Springfield, where they fail to engage the audience in discussing the environment. They are killed when the pollution in the lake erodes their barge, causing it to sink. At the funeral, Grampa has a prophetic vision, in which he predicts impending doom upon the town, but only Marge takes it seriously. Her environmentalist daughter Lisa and an Irish boy, List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#The Simpsons Movie|Colin hold a seminar where they convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig, which causes his now neglected son Bart to seek a parental figure in neighbor, Ned Flanders. Homer keeps the pig's faeces in an overflowing silo, which horrifies Marge, who tells Homer to dispose of it safely. However, Homer is distracted and instead dumps the silo into the lake, critically polluting it. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated. Nearby, Flanders and Bart bond during a hike and discover the squirrel which is captured by the EPA. List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#The Simpsons Movie|Russ Cargill, head of the EPA, takes drastic action by enclosing Springfield in a giant glass dome.

When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, an angry mob approaches the Simpsons' home and sets it on fire. The family escapes through a sinkhole in Maggie's sandbox and flees to Alaska. Meanwhile, cracks in the dome start to form and Cargill, not wanting news of what he has done to become widespread, plans Springfield's destruction. The Simpsons see a television advertisement which promotes a new Grand Canyon to be located where Springfield is. Marge and the kids decide to save the town, but Homer refuses to help the people that tried to kill them. They abandon him and leave to rescue Springfield, only to be captured and placed back in the dome. After a visit with a mysterious Inuit shaman, Homer has an epiphany that he must &quot;become selfless&quot; and save the town and proceeds to do so. Just as he arrives, a helicopter appears above Springfield and lowers a bomb suspended by rope through a hole in the dome. Homer climbs to the peak of the dome and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and bomb off. Homer then notices a motorcycle, and grabs the bomb. He reunites with Bart and the pair cycle up the side of the dome and Bart throws the bomb through the hole, seconds before detonation. The bomb explodes shattering the dome. The town praises Homer, who rides off with Marge on the motorcycle into the sunset. The film concludes with the townspeople restoring Springfield back to normal.

Production
=Development=
The production staff of ''The Simpsons'' had entertained the thought of a film since early in the series, but production never came together. The show's creator Matt Groening felt a feature length film would allow them to increase the show's scale and animate sequences too complex for a TV series.;; He intended the film to be made after the show ended, &quot;but that [...] was undone by good ratings.&quot;; There were attempts to turn the season 4 episode &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot; into a film, but difficulties were encountered in expanding the episode to feature length.;; For a long time the project was held up. There was trouble finding a story that was right for a film, and the crew did not have enough time to complete such a project, as they already worked full time year-round on the show.;; Groening also expressed a wish to make ''Simpstasia'', a parody of ''Fantasia'', although it was never produced, partly because it would have been too difficult to write a feature-length script.;; Before his death, Phil Hartman had wished to make a live action Troy McClure film, and several of the show's staff had expressed a desire to help create it.;;

The voice cast was finally signed on to do the film in 2001,;; and work then began on the script.;; The producers were initially worried that creating a film would have negative effects on the series, as they did not have enough manpower to focus their attention on both projects. As the series progressed, more writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time.; Groening and Brooks invited back Mike Scully and Al Jean (who continued to work as showrunner on the television series) to produce the film with them.; They then signed David Silverman, who in anticipation of the project had quit his job at Pixar, to direct.; The &quot;strongest possible&quot; writing team was assembled, with many of the writers from the show's early seasons being chosen for the film.; David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti were selected. Ian Maxtone-Graham and Matt Selman joined later, and Brooks, Groening, Scully, and Jean also wrote parts of the script.; Sam Simon did not return having left the show over creative differences in 1993, nor did Conan O'Brien, who wanted to work with the ''Simpsons'' staff again. O'Brien joked, &quot;Truth be told, I worry that the ''Simpsons''-writing portion of my brain has been destroyed after 14 years of talking to Lindsay Lohan and that guy from ''One Tree Hill'', so maybe it's all for the best.&quot;;; The same went for Brad Bird who &quot;entertained fantasies of asking if [he] could work on the movie&quot;, but did not have enough time because of work on ''Ratatouille''.; The producers arranged a deal with Fox that meant they could abandon production at any point if they felt the script was not going anywhere.;; 

Work continued on the screenplay from 2003 onwards and did not cease,; taking place in the small bungalow where Groening first pitched ''The Simpsons'' in 1987.;; The writers spent six months discussing a plot,; and each pitched a &quot;half-assed&quot; idea.; Jean suggested the family rescue manatees, which became the 2005 episode &quot;Bonfire of the Manatees&quot;, and there was ''The Truman Show''-esque notion of the characters discovering their lives were a TV show, which Groening rejected as he felt &quot;that the Simpsons never become aware of themselves as celebrities.&quot;; Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film.;; The decision to have Flanders in an important role also came very early on, as Jean wished to see Bart wonder what his life would be like if Flanders were his father.; Having eventually decided on the basic outline for the film, the writers then separated it into seven sections. Jean, Scully, Reiss, Swartzwelder, Vitti, Mirkin, and Meyer wrote twenty five pages each, with the group meeting one month later to merge the seven sections in to one &quot;very rough draft.&quot;; The writers wrote the script in a way that they almost always employed when writing the television series, sitting around a table and pitching ideas, trying to make each other laugh.; The script went through one hundred revisions.; Groening described his desire to also make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, as &quot;we wanna really give you something that you haven't seen before. There are moments you actually forget that you're watching a cartoon and that is difficult when you have characters as ugly as the Simpsons.&quot;;;

=Animation=
Director David Silverman looked at some of the television episodes he directed for inspiration.
Animation for the film began in January 2006,; with the ''Itchy &amp; Scratchy'' short being the first scene to be storyboarded.;; Groening rejected making either a live action or a Computer-generated imagery|CGI film,; describing the film's animation as being &quot;deliberately imperfect&quot;, and &quot;a tribute to the art of hand-drawn animation, which is basically disappearing.&quot;;; The film was animated in a wider 2.35:1 aspect ratio than the television series,;; and colored with the largest palette the animators ever had available to them.; A lot of the animation was done on Wacom#Cintiq|Wacom Cintiq tablets, a technique which enables the image to be drawn directly on to a computer monitor, which meant that the film could be animated, colored and edited together more quickly.; The film was animated at four different studios around the world: Film Roman in Burbank, California; Rough Draft Studios in Glendale, California; and AKOM and Rough Draft Korea in Seoul, South Korea. Like the television series, the storyboarding, character and background layout, and animatic parts of production were done in America, with the overseas studios completing the Traditional animation#Animation|animation, inbetweening and Traditional animation#Digital ink and paint|digital ink and paint processes.;

Director David Silverman said that unlike the TV series where &quot;you've got to pick and choose,&quot; the film allowed the opportunity to &quot;lavish that attention with every single scene that we do,&quot; also noting that the characters have shadows.; Silverman and the animators looked to ''The Incredibles'', ''Triplets of Belleville'', and ''Bad Day at Black Rock'' for inspiration as they were &quot;a great education in staging because of how the characters are placed.&quot;; They also looked at ''Dumbo'' and the Pluto cartoon ''Pluto's Judgment Day'' for a dream sequence,; and ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' for crowd scenes.; Silverman also looked at some of the episodes he had directed, primarily his two favorites &quot;Homie the Clown&quot; and &quot;Three Men and a Comic Book&quot;.;; Mike B. Anderson, Lauren MacMullan, Rich Moore, and Steven Dean Moore each directed roughly a quarter of the film under Silverman's supervision, with numerous other animators working on scenes.;;

=Casting=
As inspiration for the crowd scenes in the film, the production staff spent a long time looking at the ''Simpsons'' poster that features more than 320 of the show's characters.;; Groening said that they did try to put every single character into the film, with 98 having speaking parts,; and the crowds being filled with previously established characters rather than just generic people.; The series regulars Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer, and semi-regular performers Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden and Marcia Wallace reprised their roles.; Joe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony,;; while Albert Brooks, who supplied many guest voices in episodes, was hired as Russ Cargill,; Go to the Simpson's house, click on Lisa's book, then on &quot;Production Notes&quot;.; after he told the staff that he wanted to be part of the film.; For &quot;about a week&quot;, he was to reprise the role of Hank Scorpio from the episode &quot;You Only Move Twice&quot;, but the staff realized that creating a new character was a better idea.;
The shot of an angry mob coming for Homer features cameos from more than 320 characters.;
The cast did the first of three table readings in May 2005,;;;; and began recording every week from June 2006 onwards.;; James L. Brooks directed them for the first time since the television show's early seasons. Castellaneta described the recording sessions as &quot;much more intense&quot; than recording the television series as well as more emotionally dramatic.;; Some scenes, such as Marge's video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving the voice cast exhausted.; 

Green Day played themselves in the film after requesting to guest star in the show. They were given the part of the originally unspecified band who drown at Springfield Lake. Tom Hanks also appears as himself in the film and accepted the offer after just one phone call.; ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' creator Philip Rosenthal provides the voice of the father in the &quot;new Grand Canyon&quot; commercial with Hanks.; Minnie Driver recorded the part of a patronizing grievance counselor in a scene that ended up being cut.;; Driver found recording her part &quot;the funniest afternoon of her career&quot;,;; and was saddened when she was told it had been cut.; Edward Norton recorded the part of the man who gets crushed as the dome is implemented, performing a Woody Allen impression. The staff felt the voice distracted the audience too much and so Castellaneta re-recorded Norton's dialogue with a different voice.; Isla Fisher and Erin Brockovich also recorded cameos, but they were cut as well.; Kelsey Grammer recorded lines for Sideshow Bob, who was to appear at several different points,;; but he did not make the final cut either.; Johnny Knoxville was also touted as a possible guest star.;

Although he does not provide the voice, Arnold Schwarzenegger is President of the United States in the film. He was chosen ahead of the incumbent President George W. Bush because &quot;in two years that'd mean the film [would be] out of date.&quot;;; This idea was met with nervousness, as Brooks noted &quot;[Schwarzenegger's] opinion polls were way down, so we were sweating whether he'd make a political comeback, so it was great when he did.&quot;; The animators began by drawing an accurate caricature of Schwarzenegger,;; but one of the staff suggested that an altered version of the recurring character Rainier Wolfcastle, himself a caricature of Schwarzenegger, could act as President.; This idea was developed, with the design of Wolfcastle being edited to have more wrinkles under his eyes and a different hairstyle.;

=Editing=
Every single aspect of the film was constantly analyzed, with storylines, jokes and characters regularly being re-written.; Although most animated films do not make extensive changes to the film during active production due to budget reasons,; ''The Simpsons Movie'' crew continued to keep playing with their film even into 2007, with some edits taking place as late as May.; James L. Brooks noted, &quot;We saw a trailer the other day, and somebody said 70 percent of the things in it - based on where we were eight weeks ago - are no longer in the movie, because we keep on fooling around.&quot;; Groening said enough material for two more movies was cut.; Various new characters were created, who were cut as they did not contribute much.; Marge was to have the religious possession in the church, but the writers considered this idea too dark and changed it to Grandpa.; The role of Lisa's love interest Colin was frequently revised. He had previously been named Dexter and Adrien, and had his appearance completely revised.; One idea saw Milhouse in the role, but it was changed to a new character when the staff realized &quot;the audience was not as familiar with Milhouse's long-standing crush on [Lisa] as [they had] thought.&quot;; A large-scale car chase where Homer throws flaming mummies out of a truck at the EPA was cut, and replaced with the more emotional and realistic scenes at the motel and carnival, allowing a change of pace.; 

Further changes were made after a March 2007 preview screenings of the film in Portland, Oregon and Phoenix, Arizona,; including the deletion of Kang and Kodos heavily criticizing the film during the end credits.; A lot of people at the screenings found the original film too wiktionary:coarse|coarse, and some of Homer's behaviour too horrible, so several scenes were eased down to make him nicer.; Russ Cargill was re-designed several times, originally appearing as an older man whose speech patterns Brooks based on Donald Rumsfeld. The older model was the one used by Burger King for the action figure.; Cargill's scene with Bart and Homer at the film's conclusion was added in to fully resolve his story.; The &quot;List of animals in The Simpsons#Plopper|Spider-Pig&quot; gag was a late addition, and one excised scene, before the dome is put over Springfield, had Mr. Burns reminding viewers that it was the last point in the film that they could get a refund.; Other deletions included Homer's encounter with a sausage truck driver, a scene with Plopper the pig at the end,;; and several musical numbers throughout.; A news report, showing the dome's effect on daily life in Springfield in areas such as farming and sport, was cut as it failed in the overall context of the film.;

=Music=

James L. Brooks chose Hans Zimmer to compose the film's score, as they were good friends and regular collaborators.;; Zimmer expressed that the score was a &quot;unique challenge&quot;, stating &quot;I had to try and express the style of ''The Simpsons'' without wearing the audience out with too much attitude.&quot;;; He used Danny Elfman's original opening theme, but noted he did not want to overuse it. He created themes for each of the family. Homer's leitmotif was a major focus, and Zimmer also composed smaller themes for Bart and Marge.;; Regular television series composer Alf Clausen was not asked to score the film, noting: &quot;sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug.&quot;;;

In addition to their appearance in the film, Green Day recorded their own version of the The Simpsons Theme‎|theme song of ''The Simpsons'', which was released as a single.;; Zimmer turned the Spider-Pig song into a choral piece, which was a joke he never intended to be put into the film. Zimmer had to also write foreign-language lyrics for the thirty-two dubbed versions of the song when the film was released internationally. He found translating the song for the Spanish language dub the hardest to write. The same choir learned to sing the piece for each of the dubs.;

Cultural references
Several cultural references and allusions are made throughout the film. Green Day play &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot; on violins, in reference to ''Titanic'' as they drown.; When Bart skateboards naked he is repeatedly covered by passing objects, a reference to similar techniques used in ''Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery''.; Homer and Marge's love scene parodies many Disney films, with Disney-esque animals helping them undress.; Originally, music from ''The Wizard of Oz'' was used in that scene, and the fawn had white spots, which were removed as the animators felt it resembled Bambi too directly.; Bart impersonates Mickey Mouse on the train, claiming to be &quot;the mascot of an evil corporation.&quot;; Homer plays ''Grand Theft Walrus'', an allusion to ''Grand Theft Auto''. In the game his character shoots a tap-dancing penguin, a reference to the film ''Happy Feet''.; The &quot;Spider-Pig&quot; song is a parody of the Spider-Man theme song|theme song of the 1967 ''Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man'' TV series,; and the name of Lisa's lecture ''An Irritating Truth'' is a reference to Al Gore's film ''An Inconvenient Truth''.;; The bomb disposal robot was based on Vincent D'Onofrio's character Leonard &quot;Pyle&quot; Lawrence from the film ''Full Metal Jacket'', who commits suicide in a similar way.; At the end, the crowd celebrate in a similar way to the conclusion of ''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'', with Carl performing the exact same hand gestures as Lando Calrissian.; 

The Carpenters' song &quot;(They Long to Be) Close to You&quot; was used in Homer and Marge's wedding video as it had been used in several emotional moments between the two in the TV series.; As Homer leaves Eski-Moe's he grabs on to a passing truck and uses it to propel himself back to the house, an homage to Buster Keaton,; while the epiphany features homages to ''Brazil'' and the works of Salvador Dali.; Hillary Clinton appears as Itchy's vice president in the short, while an Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc from ''The Lord of the Rings'' appears in the mob scene.; A cut reference saw Marge and the kids go on the TV talk show ''The View'' to spread the news of Springfield's impending doom. Parts were written for all of the show's panel, and the scene would pan out with Russ Cargill appearing and having a gun fight with Joy Behar.; Another dropped sequence saw Moe describe Springfield's varying physical states inside the dome, one of which was Autopia, a reference to the Disneyland ride.; Several jokes reference events of the series, including the wreckage of the ambulance crashed into a tree next to Springfield Gorge from the episode &quot;Bart the Daredevil&quot;.; ;

Themes
In this scene, an apple tree was inserted into the background behind Lisa and Colin, in reference to the biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.
Al Jean described the film's message as being &quot;a man should listen to his wife.&quot; In addition, the film parodies the two major contemporary concerns of religion and environmentalism.;; The environment is present in Homer's polluting of Lake Springfield, Green Day's cameo, and Lisa's romance. The villainous Russ Cargill, is head of the EPA.; Reviewer Ed Gonzalez argued the plot was a satire of the government's reaction to New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.; Ian Nathan of ''Empire'' criticized this focus, writing that it gave the film an &quot;overt political agenda, bang[ing] the drum for Al Gore’s eco-message [that] it borders on wiktionary:polemic|polemic.&quot;;

Religion is focused on in Grampa's momentary possession, and Marge believing what he said to be a message from God.; Groening joked the film &quot;posit[s] the existence of a very active God,&quot; when asked if it was likely to offend.; Mark I. Pinsky, author of ''The Gospel According to The Simpsons'', said the film &quot;treats genuine faith with respect, while keeping a sharp eye out for religious pretension and hypocrisy of all kinds.&quot; He felt it took a &quot;chance to unmask everyone's human fallibility&quot; in the scene where the tenants of Moe's Tavern run into the Church, and vice versa. In analyzing Ned Flanders' role, he wrote, &quot;It is willingness of ''The Simpsons Movie'' to depict all the different sides of us – the good, the bad, the cynical and the reverent – that makes it so rich and funny on our complicated, all-too-human relationship with religion.&quot;;; The animators inserted an apple tree behind Lisa and Colin during their initial meeting, in reference to the biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Trees were implemented into every important or emotional scene throughout the film.;

You just tune in and see what happens.&quot;;

=Critical reception=
;

''The Times'';'; James Bone commented, &quot;the film boasts the same sly cultural references and flashes of brilliance that have earned the television series a following that ranges from tots to comparative literature PhDs,&quot;;; while ''The Guardian'';';s Peter Bradshaw stated that &quot;''The Simpsons Movie'' gives you everything you could possibly want, and maybe it's a victim of its own gargantuan accomplishment. Eighty-five minutes is not long enough to do justice to 17 years of comedy genius. It's still great stuff.&quot;;; Ed Gonzalez praised the film's political message, likening the ''Itchy &amp; Scratchy'' cartoon at the beginning to President Schwarzenegger's situation later on, as well as praising the film's many sight gags.;; Randy Shulman gave strong praise of the cast who he described as having &quot;elevated their vocal work to a craft that goes way beyond simple line readings,&quot; particularly Kavner who &quot;gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever to find its way into a movie based on an irreverent cartoon&quot;.;; Roger Ebert, although &quot;not generally a fan of movies spun off from TV animation&quot;, gave a positive review, calling it a &quot;radical and simple at the same time, subversive and good-hearted, offensive without really meaning to be.&quot;;; Richard Corliss of ''Time'' decided that the film &quot;was worth waiting for&quot; as &quot;it doesn't try to be ruder or kinkier, just bigger and better.&quot;;; 

''USA Today'' film critic Claudia Puig found that the story &quot;does warrant a full-length feature, thanks to a clever plot and non-stop irreverent humor&quot;, but stated that some fans may &quot;miss seeing their favorite characters, a few regulars are pared down, and others don't show up at all.&quot;;; Patrick Kolan found that the film was &quot;easily the best stuff to come from the house of Simpson since season 12 or 13&quot; and praised the animation, but commented on the &quot;small and unfunny&quot; appearances of characters such as Comic Book Guy and Seymour Skinner.;; Kirk Honeycutt of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' praised the film's good nature, stating the laughs &quot;come in all sizes&quot;, although noting that &quot;little has been gained bringing the Simpsons to the screen.&quot;;; ''Variety'';';s Brian Lowry called it &quot;clever, irreverent, satirical and outfitted&quot; but that it was &quot;just barely&quot; capable of sustaining a longer plot than a television episode.;; Lisa Schwarzbaum praised the voice cast but stated that the &quot;action sequences sometimes falter.&quot;;; Comparing the film with the early episodes of the show, one reviewer concluded that the film &quot;has more going for it than the show in its later years, but is still a long way short of what made it so invigorating right back in the early nineties.&quot;;;
 
Negative criticism came from ''Empire'' reviewer Ian Nathan who compared the film to New Coke as &quot;it utterly failed.&quot;;; Phil Villarreal noted that there are &quot;too few laugh-worthy moments&quot; and that &quot;instead of stretching to new frontiers, the film rests on the familiar.&quot;;; Sheila Johnston agreed and criticised the pacing and joke level, finding that &quot;the overall momentum flags at times&quot; as the film overstretches itself, being &quot;a salvo of comic squibs, some very funny, others limp.&quot;;; David Edwards concured, writing that &quot;there's a great half-hour show rattling around in here somewhere, but the rest is padding at its very dullest.&quot;;; Cosmo Landesman stated that &quot;the humour seems to have lost its satirical bite and wit&quot; and that &quot;much of the comedy is structured around the idiocy of Homer, which is a shame.&quot;;; Bruce Newman criticized the fleeting appearances of many of the show's secondary characters, finding the film &quot;[not] a disaster, just a disappointment.&quot;;;
