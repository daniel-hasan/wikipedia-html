Omar Ahmed Khadr born September 19, 1986 in Toronto, is a Canadian who is accused by U.S. forces of being a terrorist. He was captured while fighting against American forces in Afghanistan when he was 15 years of age.;[http://www.dod.mil/news/May2006/d20060515%20List.pdf list of prisoners (.pdf)], ''US Department of Defense'', May 15 2006; 
His case has drawn considerable attention as a child soldier, and he is among the youngest prisoners held in extrajudicial detention in the Guantánamo Bay detainment camps, in Cuba, and the only Canadian.

On 2007-06-04, a military court dismissed all charges against Khadr because of a procedural flaw - the court was authorized to try unlawful enemy combatants, but an earlier review had labelled Khadr as merely an &quot;enemy combatant&quot;;
;.On 2007-09-24, a military court ruled that the dismissal was in error.The terrorism case against Mr. Khadr will then be reopened.;

Life in Canada
Omar Khadr, like most of the children in the Khadr family, was born in Canada, and both parents were Canadian citizens.Through 1985 to 1997 mostly the family was living in Peshawar, Pakistan, where the father Ahmed Said Khadr was working, they visited Canada on a 1-2 year basis.;[http://www.hvk.org/articles/1202/293.html The Good Son], originally published in the ''National Post'', December 28, 2002; 

In 1992 Ahmed Said Khadr was wounded by a land-mine, and spent a year back in Canada recovering his health.

Life in bin Laden's compound
Khadr's father moved his family to Afghanistan in 1997, where they lived in their office compound. They later moved to bin Laden's compound but only after it had been evacuated. During their stay in their office the family visited the bin Laden compound occasionaly and the children played with his children amongst others.;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/khadr/ Son of al Qaeda], ''Frontline (PBS)'';Khadr's father has been described as one of bin Laden's senior lieutenants.

Omar's older brother Abdurahman Khadr described being sent to military training camps shortly after his arrival, when he was just eleven years old.All of the Khadr boys are believed to have military training while they werechildren.

Capture
On 2002-07-22, 15-year-old Khadr was in a compound near Khost that was surrounded by US special forces.According to Master Sgt Scotty Hansen of Utah, &quot;we [sent] a couple of Afghan interpreters to go in and talk to them because we didn't want to be storm troopers unless we had to.&quot;The two interpreters were shot &quot;point blank in the face,&quot; however, according to Sergeant Layne Morris, after which &quot;all heck broke out,&quot; according to Hansen;http://www.thestar.com/News/article/208502;.Sergeant Layne Morris was injured early in the skirmish.The Americans called in a devasting air strike, such that no survivors were expected.Khadr, however, survived and allegedly threw a grenade, which injured Sgt. Christopher Speer and led to his death, and injured three other members of the squad.;[http://www.hvk.org/articles/1202/293.html The Good Son], originally published in the ''National Post'', December 28, 2002; 
Omar was shot three times, and left nearly blind in one eye. He received medical treatment for the gunshot wounds upon being captured.

Accusations against Khadr

In addition to being charged with the murder of Sgt. Christopher Speer, Khadr is also being accused of attempted murder, conspiracy, spying and &quot;providing material support for terrorism&quot;.;
;

On 2007-11-18, ''60 Minutes'' aired a video of Khadr assembling bombs while wearing civilian clothes.;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/16/60minutes/main3516048.shtml;

Incarceration at Guantánamo Bay
There were other child detainees incarcerated at Guantánamo Bay.Three of them were kept in a smaller compound, Camp Iguana, where they were allegedly treated humanely.They were not required to wear the orange coveralls.They were provided with school teachers, and recreation.The BBC interviewed one 13-year-old child detainee upon his return to Afghanistan.He had learned to read at Camp Iguana.The two years he spent there were the only education he had ever had, and he reported being sorry to leave.

Elaine Chao the United States Secretary of Labor has spoken about the responsibility to give child soldiers special treatment, to provide help for them to re-integrate into society.;Elaine L. Chao, [http://www.dol.gov/_sec/media/speeches/20030507_ILAB_ChildSoldiers.htm Children in the Crossfire: Prevention and Rehabilitation of Child Soldiers], ''US Department of Labor'', May 7 2003;She announced a $3 million program to help re-integrate child-soldiers in Afghanistan back into Afghan society.

However, Khadr was treated as an adult.Khadr has been reported to have been kept in solitary confinement, for long periods of time; to have been denied adequate medical treatment; to have been subjected to ''&quot;short shackling&quot;'' , and left bound, in uncomfortable ''&quot;stress positions&quot;'' until he soiled himself.; 
;;
;;
;
In a press conference on 2005-01-16, Khadr's lawyers described how Khadr's captors took Khadr's still bound body and wiped his hair and clothes in his urine and feces.;
;

Bryan Del Monte, the United States Department of Defense deputy director for political development and international issues in the Office of Detainee Affairs, gave a press conference following his return from testifying before the United Nations Committee against torture. ; [http://aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=3&amp;id=4927 US DoD Official Discusses Guantanamo], ''Asharq Alawsat'', May 13 2006;
During this press conference he asserted that Khadr, and two other youths, were incarcerated separately from adults, and were provided with daily lessons:
;Del Monte said that those in charge of the Guantanamo detention camp provide the three youngsters with lessons every morning in Mathematics, English, Sciences, and other subjects for their mental and psychological needs in addition to teaching physical fitness and sports.;

Del Monte's assertion stands in contrast to the other accounts of Khadr's incarceration, where he has been described as leading the prayer sessions of the other detainees in his cell block.

= Khadr's Combatant Status Review=
Khadr's case was reviewed by the Combatant Status Review Tribunal on 2004-09-08.The review released a one page summary of their conclusions on 2004-09-17.Khadr's lawyers had written him a letter, recommending that he refrain from cooperating with the tribunal, or any questioning conducted without adequate legal representation.

The tribunal concluded that Khadr was an &quot;enemy combatant&quot;.

At the time of his hearing Khadr had not been allowed to meet with any lawyer and no consideration was given to the fact he was a child soldier at the time of the attack.

Defence attorney Dennis Edney (L) and Lt. Cmdr. William C. Kuebler|Bill Kuebler (R)
Omar Khadr's brother Abdurahman Khadr claimed in the documentary Son of al Qaeda that he talked with Omar over a fence in 2003. At the time, Abdurahman was a prisoner at Guantanamo as well, though he later claimed that he was there on a mission for the American Central Intelligence Agency. Omar reportedly told Abdurahman to stick to a previously agreed-upon story that the family had no connections to Al Qaeda, and that his health was fine.

A June 15, 2005 article in ''Newsday'' cited Muneer Ahmad's experience as an example of the difficulties the Pentagon presented to detainees' lawyers.;[http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/ny-woguan0615,0,2202228,print.story?coll=ny-world-big-pix At Gitmo, still no day in court: How feds avoid hearings for terror suspects — despite Supreme Court ruling], ''Newsday'', June 15, 2005;
Ahmad also reported that Khadr had described extensive abusive treatment to him, but that when he arrived at the Virginia security centre, all twenty pages of his notes had been redacted.

Mr Ahmad's first meeting with Khadr was not until November 2004.Khadr has still not been permitted to speak with the Canadian lawyers who were his family's first choice.[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/03/08/khadrspeaks.html CBCNews] reported that Khadr was finally permitted to speak with his mother by phone in March, 2007, after approximately five years of detainment.

= Hunger strikes=
On September 1 2005, the ''Globe and Mail'' reported that Dennis Edney, one of Khadr's Canadian lawyers reported that Khadr was participating in a second hunger strike.;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v4/sub/MarketingPage?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20050901%2FKHADR01%2FTPInternational%2FTopStories&amp;ord=15050617&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;redirect_reason=2&amp;denial_reasons=none&amp;force_login=false Canadian teen in Guantanamo on hunger strike, lawyers say], ''Globe and Mail'' September 1 2005;Khadr participated in the 200-member hunger strike that occurred in late June and July.The Globe article reports that lawyers said Khadr's first hunger strike lasted 15 days, and that prison authorities administered intravenous fluid.Khadr reported collapsing as he left the hospital, and that his guards administered a brutal beating.;

Khadr Military Commission

On November 7, 2005, Khadr and nine other Guantanamo inmates were charged to be tried by &quot;Military Commission&quot;, but the commission was struck down as unlawful by the US Supreme Court in 2006.After the MCA was signed in October 2006, new charges were sworn against Khadr on February 2, 2007.Khadr also petitioned the US Supreme Court to review the legality of the military commission and his detention, but this request was [http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/04/30/khadr-court.html denied] April, 2007.

First round of charges on November 7, 2005

Khadr was charged with murder for his actions against the squad inside the compound near Khost, Afghanistan.
The charges against Mr. Khadr allege that his father, the late Ahmed Said Khadr, a Canadian Islamic extremist, was a close friend of Osama bin Laden and his Egyptian deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri, and that Omar Khadr also was acquainted with Mr. bin Laden, the Al Qaeda leader.;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60F16FF3E5A0C7B8CDDA80994DD404482 Pentagon Charges 5 More In Guantánamo Bay Camp], ''The New York Times'', November 8 2005;

=Early prosecutorial accusations=

Colonel Morris Davis, a Khadr Prosecutor, spoke out against Khadr, to the press.;[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/world/060110/w011074.html U.S. prosecutor in Khadr case blasts sympathetic views of Canadian teen], CBC, January 10 2006;

=Preliminary hearing=

On March 30 2006, Khadr, and the other nine detainees who face charges, were transferred to solitary confinement.;[http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1144273817399&amp;call_pageid=968332188854&amp;col=968350060724 Khadr vows boycott as shouts rock U.S. court: Toronto teen moved to solitary confinement Accused terrorist demands `humane and fair' treatment], ''Toronto Star'', April 6 2006;

Commander Robert Durand said, ''&quot;Consistent with Army regulations, individuals in a pretrial status are separated from the general population. These measures are largely for the protection of the detainee.&quot;

On April 5 2006 Khadr read out a note that said: ''&quot;Excuse me Mr. Judge,.. I'm being punished for exercising my right and being co-operative in participating in this military commission. For that, I say with my respect to you and everybody else here, that I'm boycotting these procedures until I be treated humanely and fair.&quot;;[http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1144273817399&amp;call_pageid=968332188854&amp;col=968350060724 Khadr vows boycott as shouts rock U.S. court: Toronto teen moved to solitary confinement Accused terrorist demands `humane and fair' treatment], ''Toronto Star'', April 6 2006;

On 2006-04-07, Khadr's lawyers reversed course stating on the record in front of the commission that after consulting with U.S. military officials that Khadr's current conditions of confinement were indeed humane and not done in order to &quot;punish&quot; Khadr for being cooperative in participating in commission proceedings. 

=Independent medical examination=

Khadr lawyers have been trying, with no success so far, to arrange for Khadr to get an independent medical examination.; [http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/14902061.htm Teen's defense looks to doctor for help], ''Miami Herald'', June 26 2006;; [http://www.miami.com/multimedia/miami/news/gitmo-khadr.pdf Second Request for Appointment of Expert Consultant: Dr. Xenakis and Dr. Cantor (.pdf)], 'Miami Herald'', June 13 2006;
They assert that a psychological evaluation is routine for any suspect charged with a murder committed when they were a minor.They state that an independent examination is essential for them to be able to effectively craft their defense.Further they assert that the suicides on June 10 2006 put Khadr at greater risk.

Khadr's lawyers had administered a psychological questionnaire to Khadr during one of their earlier visits.; [http://www.miami.com/multimedia/miami/news/gitmo-khadr.pdf Second Request for Appointment of Expert Consultant: Dr. Xenakis and Dr. Cantor (.pdf)], 'Miami Herald'', June 13 2006;An analysis of Khadr's answers indicated that he was at moderate to high risk of committing suicide.

;;

=Charges dismissed=
On 2007-06-04, the second round of charges were dismissed by Army Judge Col. Peter Brownback because Khadr was not classified as an &quot;alien unlawful enemy combatant.&quot;;
;
Khadr was previously classified as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; by his Combatant Status Review Tribunal, in late 2004. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 says that military commissions do not have jurisdiction over those classified as &quot;lawful combatants&quot;. Despite the dismissal of charges, Khadr will remain in detention.;;

=The Court of Military Commission Review's ruling=

On September 25, 2007, Thomas W. Hartmann, the Legal Adviser to the Convening Authority in the Department of Defense Office of Military Commissions, announced that the Court of Military Commission Review had reached a decision about the George W. Bush|Bush Presidency's appeal of Brownback's ruling.;
;;
;;
;

Brownback and Allred's ruling took the Department of Defense by surprise. The United States Congress, when it passed the Military Commissions Act, had mandated that the DoD set up a court where appeals to the Commissions' ruling could take place. But the Court had not been appointed, and the rules under which the court should function had not been fleshed out.

Hartmann anncounced that the Court of Review confirmed that the distinction between an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; and an &quot;unlawful enemy combatant&quot; was a significant distinction.;;; However, the Court of Review also ruled that the Military Commissions themselves had the authority to make the determination that a captive was an &quot;unlawful enemy combatant&quot;. Consequently, Khadr continues to face the second set of charges laid against him on February 2 2007.;

=Dennis Edney barred from Guantanamo=

Omar Khadr fought for the right to consult with Canadian lawyers since his arrival at Guantanamo.;
;
In 2006 Dennis Edney and Nathan Whiting were given permission to visit him at Guantanamo.However, in late October, the new Chief Defense counsel barred Edney from visiting Khadr, or attending his trial.;
;
According to the ''Associated Press''
Edney was barred because he has criticized Lieutenant Command Keubler's efforts. Edney thinks Keubler has focussed his energy on lobbying Canadian authorities to have Khadr repatriated, at the cost of preparing for Khadr's trial.
According to the ''Toronto Star'' Edney has said;
;:


=November 8 2007 hearing=
Image said to be of Omar Khadr, leaked to CBS News after Peter Brownback declined to allow it to be shown during the November 8 hearing.

Colonel Brownback convened on November 8 2007.Observers expected him to accept the authority granted to him by the Court of Review to make a ruling as to whether Khadrwas or was not an unlawful combatant.

Lieutenant Commander Kuebler challenged Brownback over whether he was qualified to preside over the commission.
Brownback ruled that since none of the attorneys had challenged his jurisdiction the question of jurisdiction was moot.

Brownback did not make a ruling as to whether Khadr was or was not an unlawful combatant because the Defense had recently learned the Prosecution had exculpatory evidence that they had not chosen to share with the defense.;
;;
;;
;;
;;
;;
;;
;

According to the ''Los Angeles Times'';:


One of the pieces of evidence Groharing had protested not being allowed to present during the November 8 2007 hearing was a videotape.;
;
The videotape was said to show Omar Khadr planting mines.
The next broadcast of the CBS News show 60 Minutes showed extensive clips from this video.
Commander Jeffrey Gordon, a Department of Defense spokesman, claimed that the videotape had not been leaked by anyone within the Prosecution, or the Office of Military Commission.

Official Canadian reaction

An article published on August 20 2007 in the ''Toronto Star'' quotes a 2002 press release from Bill Graham, who was then Canada's Foreign Minister:;
;


The article notes that Graham's office subsequently tried to claw back the concerns over Khadr's youth.;

In early 2003 Jim Gould, an official with Foreign Affairs' intelligence division, and an official from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, were allowed to meet with Khadr.;The USA was not allowing consular access to the captives, but Gould's observations were to be used by Foreign Affairs to report that: ''&quot;Officials met Mr. Khadr and he seems well.&quot; 

The ''Toronto Stars report states that when they achieved access to Gould's report it stated;:


Amnesty International call for official Canadian intervention

In late June of 2007
Amnesty International Canada called on the Canadian Government to intervene on Khadr's behalf.;
;
The open letter AI released was signed by two former foreign affairs ministers and several sitting members of parliament.
The letter acknowledges that the Khadr family has an unsympathetic reception in Canada: 

The ''Los Angeles Times'' interviewed Khadr's mother and older sister, quoting his mother about how Omar came to be in the compound where the skirmish took place.;
According to the article: 

The Canadian Bar Association urged Canadian Prime Minister to repatriate Khadr to stand trial in the Canadian justice system.;
;;
;
Other legal experts outlined difficulties in trying Khadr in Canada.

Further allegations

On July 12 2007 Prosecutor Major Jeffrey Groharing leveled new allegations against Khadr.;
;
Groharing accused Khadr of confessing to wishing to kill Americans to earn a $1,500 bounty.

The ''Globe and Mail'' quoted from the 24 pages of new charges Groharing released;: 


Khadr's lawyers noted the allegations had never been leveled in any of the previous documents or proceedings during Khadr's five years in custody.;

Nathan Whiting, one of Khadr's Canadian lawyers, response to the American claims that Khadr was motivated by a bounty was;:


Khadr didn't arrive at Guantanamo until October 2002.This interrogation where Groharing claims Khadr confessed would have occurred in Afghanistan, while Khadr was still recovering from his wounds.Khadr's lawyers have previously claimed that Khadr's interrogators in Afghanistan denied him pain medication to soften him up for interrogation.

Tabitha Speer, Sergeant Speer's widow, and Sergeant Layne Morris, launched a civil suit against the estate of Ahmed Said Khadr, Omar Khadr's father.; [http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_3522572 GI injured in Afghan war wins lawsuit: Unique case: Court awards default judgment to man blinded in one eye], ''Salt Lake Tribune'', February 16 2006;
They argue that as Khadr was a child, his parents were responsible for his actions, and that since his parents should have kept him from picking up a gun on the battlefield, they were responsible for any wounds he inflicted.Normally, under US law, one can't sue for damages that were caused by &quot;acts of war&quot;.Speer and Morris argue that Khadr was engaged in an act of terrorism, not an act of war.

They have described the law-suit as &quot;an attempt to attack terrorism in its bank account&quot;.

An article published in the June 14 2007 ''Salt Lake Tribune'' said that Morris and Speer's widow might collect funds via the U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.;
;
The article quotes a Treasury Department official who acknowledged that Ahmed Khadr's assets had been frozen, but said it was up to Morris and Speer to locate them.
