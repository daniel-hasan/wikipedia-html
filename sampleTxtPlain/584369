James Jesse Strang (March 21 1813 &amp;ndash; July 9 1856) was one of three major contenders for leadership of the Latter Day Saint movement during the 1844 Succession Crisis. Rejected by the principal body of Mormons in Nauvoo, Illinois, he became the founder and prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), claiming it to be the sole legitimate continuation of the Church of Christ founded in 1830 by Joseph Smith, Jr..In this capacity, he served as the crowned&quot;king&quot; of an ecclesiastical monarchy that existed for six years within the U.S. state of Michigan.

In contrast to Joseph Smith, who had served as &quot;president&quot; of his church, Strang taught that Smith's prophetic office embodied an overtly ''royal'' attribute, by which its occupant was to be not only the spiritual leader of his people, but their temporal king as well.;Strang 1856, pp.168-76.;;&quot;[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/strang,_the_king.htm Strang, the King]&quot;. ''MormonBeliefs.com''. Retrieved on 2007-10-28.; He offered a sophisticated set of teachings that differed in many significant aspects from any other version of Mormonism, including that preached by Smith.Additionally, Strang was at various times a lawyer, educator, temperance lecturer, newspaper editor, Baptist minister, correspondent for the ''New York Tribune'', state legislator, and amateur scientist.His survey of Beaver Island's natural history was published by the Smithsonian Institution, remaining the definitive work on the subject for nearly a century,;Weeks, Robert P. (June 1970).[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1970/4/1970_4_4.shtml &quot;For His Was the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory...Briefly]&quot;. ''American Heritage'' 21 (4).; while his career in the Michigan legislature was praised even by his enemies.

To bolster his prophetic claims, Strang published translations of two allegedly long-lost works: the Voree Record, deciphered from three metal plates unearthed in response to a vision; and the Book of the Law of the Lord, transcribed from the Plates of Laban mentioned in The Book of Mormon.These are accepted as scripture by his followers, but not by any other Latter Day Saint church.Building an organization that eventually rivaled Brigham Young's, Strang gained nearly 12,000 adherents;&quot;[http://www.strangite.org/History.htm History and Succession]&quot;.

Summary of Latter Day Saint leadership
James Strang was baptised by Joseph Smith, Jr. as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on February 25 1844 in Nauvoo, Illinois. On March 3 of that year, he was ordained an Elder by Hyrum Smith, Joseph's brother. Shortly after Smith's Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|murder on June 27, 1844, Strang announced that Smith had appointed him to take over leadership of the church.His claims were quickly rejected by ten of Smith's Twelve Apostles, who gained the support of most church members in Nauvoo. However, Strang managed to win enough disciples to form a viable organization of his own.Among the more prominent of these were four of the eleven &quot;witnesses&quot; to The Book of Mormon, three of Joseph Smith's apostles, a leading bishop of his church, ;Fitzpatrick, pp. 159-75.; and several members of Smith's family, including his mother.Nearly all of these later repudiated Strang, however, mostly due to his eventual sanctioning of polygamy.Many would later go on to help in founding the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which became the primary advocate of a non-polygamous version of the Latter Day Saint religion.

Strang's church was originally centered in Voree, Wisconsin, just outside present-day Burlington, which his &quot;Letter of Appointment&quot; named as the new &quot;gathering place&quot; for the Latter Day Saints.In 1848, Strang moved his followers to Beaver Island in Lake Michigan, where he was proclaimed the &quot;king&quot; of his people in 1850.;Fitzpatrick, pg. 199.;While his church suffered persecution there, it continued to grow, steadily gaining converts from other Latter Day Saint sects until Strang's assassination in 1856.His followers were subsequently driven from the island, and while most later disavowed him, a small but devout remnant still practices Strang's teachings today.

Strang's organization is formally known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.During the nineteenth century, followers of Brigham Young were sometimes referred to as &quot;Brighamites,&quot; while those of Sidney Rigdon were called &quot;Rigdonites,&quot; and disciples of Strang became &quot;Strangites&quot;. ;&quot;[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter%20Day%20Saints%20(Strangite).htm Church of Jesus Christ of Ladder Day Saints]&quot;.

Childhood, education and conversion
James Jesse Strang was born March 21 1813, in Scipio, Cayuga County, New York. He was the second of three children, and his parents had a good reputation in their community.James' mother was very tender with him as a consequence of delicate health, yet she required him to render an account of all his actions and words while absent from her.;Post, Warren. &quot;[http://www.strangstudies.org/James_Jesse_Strang/ History of James Strang: The Birth and Parentage of the Prophet James]&quot;. ''StrangStudies.org''. Retrieved on 2007-10-28.;In a brief autobiography he wrote in 1855, Strang reported that he had attended grade school until age twelve, but that &quot;the terms were usually short, the teachers inexperienced and ill qualified to teach, and my health such as to preclude attentive study or steady attendance.&quot;He estimated that his time in a classroom during those years totalled six months.;&quot;[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/strang,_the_man.htm Strang, the Man]&quot;.

But none of this meant that Strang was illiterate or simple.Although his teachers &quot;not unfrequently turned me off with little or no attention, as though I was too stupid to learn and too dull to feel neglect,&quot; Strang recalled that he spent &quot;long weary days...upon the floor, thinking, thinking, thinking....my mind wandered over fields that old men shrink from, seeking rest and finding none till darkness gathered thick around and I burst into tears.&quot;;&quot;[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/strang,_the_man.htm Strang, the Man]&quot;.

As a youth, Strang kept a rather profound personal diary, written partly in a secret code that was not deciphered until over one hundred years after it was authored (ironically, by Strang's own grandson Mark Strang, a banker in Long Beach, California).This journal contains Strang's musings on a variety of topics, including his desire to &quot;rival Caesar or Napoleon&quot; and his regret that by age nineteen, he had not yet become a general or member of the state legislature, which he saw as being essential by that point in his life to his quest for fame.;Strang, Mark. 
(1961). ''The Diary of James J. Strang: Deciphered, Transcribed, Introduced, and Annotated''. East Lansing: Michigan State University Press. Entry for March 21 1832.;However, Strang's diary equally reveals a sincere desire to be of service to his fellow man, together with agonized frustration at not knowing how he might do so as a penniless, unknown youth from upstate New York.

At age twelve, Strang was baptised a Baptist.He did not wish to follow his father's calling as a farmer, so he took up the study of civil law.Strang was admitted to the bar in New York at age 23 and later at other places where he resided. He became county Postmaster and edited a local newspaper, the ''Randolph Herald''.;Jensen, Robin (2005).

Strang, who once described himself as a &quot;cool philosopher&quot;; and a freethinker, became a Baptist minister but left in February of 1844 to join the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He quickly found favor with Joseph Smith, though they had known each other only a short time, and was baptized personally by him.;Fitzpatrick, pg. 27.;;Greene, John P.

Succession claim and notable early allies

 Page three of Strang's &quot;Letter of Appointment,&quot; with allegedly forged signature of Joseph Smith, Jr..

Following Smith's demise, several men claimed the right to lead the Latter Day Saints.The most significant of these were Brigham Young, president of Smith's Twelve Apostles; Sidney Rigdon, the sole surviving member of Smith's First Presidency; and James Strang.A power struggle ensued, and Young eventually led the bulk of Smith's followers to Utah while Rigdon led his to Pennsylvania.As a newcomer to the faith, Strang did not possess the name recognition enjoyed by his rivals, and so faced an &quot;uphill&quot; battle in his quest to be recognized as the heir to Smith's prophetic mantle.Though the Quorum of Twelve published a notice in the ''Times and Seasons'' of Strang's excommunication,;''Times and Seasons'', Vol. V., No. 16, September 2, 1844. http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n16.htm.; Strang insisted that he had never received a legitimate trial.He equally asserted that the Twelve had no right to sit in judgment on him, as ''he'' was the lawful President of the church.;''Gospel Herald'', Vol. III, No. 22, August 17, 1848. http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/IA/JStrang2.htm;

To back his claim, Strang produced a &quot;Letter of Appointment&quot; allegedly from Smith, carrying a Nauvoo postmark and dated June 18 1844.He furthermore testified that an angel appointed him as Joseph Smith's successor at the time Smith died.Smith and Strang were some 200&amp;nbsp;miles (320&amp;nbsp;km) apart at the time, and Strang offered witnesses to affirm that he had made his announcement before news of Smith's demise was publicly available.;Strang 1854b, pg. 23.;Strang's letter is held today by Yale University.

Most defections, however, were due to Strang's seemingly abrupt &quot;about-face&quot; on the turbulent subject of polygamy.Vehemently opposed to the practice at first,;(August 12 1847). ''Voree Herald'' as quoted in Fitzpatrick, pp. 74-5.See also Apostle John E. Page at this same source, on his conversations with Strang on the subject. ; Strang reversed course in 1849 to become one of its strongest advocates, marrying five wives (including his original spouse, Mary) and fathering fourteen children.Since many of his early disciples viewed him as a monogamous counterweight to Brigham Young's polygamous version of Mormonism, Strang's decision to embrace plural marriage proved costly to him and his organization.Strang defended his new tenet by claiming that, far from enslaving or demeaning women, polygamy would ''liberate'' and &quot;elevate&quot; them by allowing them to choose the best possible mate based upon any factors deemed important to them--even if that mate were already married to someone else.Rather than being forced to wed &quot;corrupt and degraded sires&quot; due to the scarcity of more suitable men, a woman could marry the man she saw as the most compatible to herself, the best candidate to father her children and give her the finest possible life, no matter how many other wives he might have.;Strang 1856, pp. 318-28.;

Strang's first wife was Mary Perce, whom he married on November 20 1836, when she was eighteen and he was twenty-three.They were separated in May of 1851, though they remained legally married until Strang's death.;Fitzpatrick, pg. 82.;His second wife, married on July 13 1849, was nineteen-year old Elvira Eliza Field (who disguised herself at first as &quot;Charlie J. Douglas,&quot; Strang's purported nephew, before revealing her true identity in 1850).Strang's third wife was thirty-one year old Betsy McNutt, whom he married on January 19 1852; his fourth was nineteen-year old Sarah Adelia Wright, married on July 15 1855.Ironically, decades after Strang's death, Sarah would divorce her second husband, one Dr. Wing, due to ''his'' interest in polygamy.;Fitzpatrick, pg. 127.;Strang's last wife was eighteen-year old Phoebe Wright, cousin to Sarah, whom he wed on October 27 1855, less than one year before his murder.

Sarah Wright described Strang as &quot;a very mild-spoken, kind man to his family, although his word was law.&quot;She wrote that while each wife had her own bedroom, they shared meals and devotional time together with Strang and that life in their household was &quot;as pleasant as possible.&quot;;;On the other hand, Strang and Phoebe Wright's daughter, Eugenia, wrote in 1936 that after only eight months of marriage, her mother had &quot;begun to feel dissatisfied with polygamy, though she loved him [Strang] devotedly all her life.&quot;;Fitzpatrick, pg. 84.;

Theological contributions

Like Joseph Smith, James Strang reported numerous visions, unearthed and translated ancient metal plates using the Urim and Thummim, and claimed to have restored long-lost spiritual knowledge to humankind.Like Smith, he presented witnesses to authenticate the records he claimed to have received.;Weeks, pp. iv, 250.;''Unlike'' Smith, however, Strang offered his plates to the public for examination. The non-Mormon Christopher Sholes&amp;ndash;inventor of the typewriter and editor of a local newspaper&amp;ndash;perused Strang's &quot;Voree Plates&quot;, a minuscule brass chronicle Strang said he had been led to by a vision in 1845.; Sholes offered no opinion on Strang's find, but described the would-be prophet as &quot;honest and earnest&quot; and opined that his followers ranked &quot;among the most honest and intelligent men in the neighborhood.&quot;;Fitzpatrick, pg.36.;Strang published his translation of these plates as the &quot;Voree Record,&quot; purporting to be the last testament of one &quot;Rajah Manchou of Vorito,&quot; who had lived in the area centuries earlier and wished to leave a brief statement for posterity.While many scoffed, two modern scholars have affirmed that the text on the plates appears to represent a genuine, albeit unknown, language.;http://www.strangite.org/Plates.htm.These studies were based upon a copper plate image of the plates made during Strang's lifetime.;The Voree Plates disappeared around 1900, and their current whereabouts is unknown.;A drawing of these plates, with translation and testimony of their discovery, may be found at James J.

Strang received several other revelations, which while never formally added to his church's Doctrine and Covenants, are nevertheless accepted as scripture by his followers.;These revelations may be read at http://www.strangite.org/Reveal.htm.;These concerned, among other things, Baptism for the Dead, the building of a temple in Voree, the standing of Sidney Rigdon, and an invitation for Joseph Smith III, eldest son of Joseph Smith, Jr., to take a position as Counselor in Strang's First Presidency.&quot;Young Joseph&quot; never accepted this calling and refused to have anything to do with Strang's organization.Strang also authored ''The Diamond'', an attack on the claims of Sidney Rigdon and Brigham Young, and ''The Prophetic Controversy'', ostensibly for Mrs. Martha Coray, co-author with Lucy Mack Smith of The History of Joseph Smith by His Mother.Coray, a partisan of Brigham Young's, had challenged &quot;the vain usurper&quot; to provide convincing evidence of his claims,;Strang 1854b, pg. 1.; and Strang attempted to oblige in this open letter addressed to her.Coray's reaction to Strang's missive has not been preserved.

=Distinctive dogmas=
Some of Strang's teachings differed substantially from those of other Latter Day Saint leaders, including Joseph Smith.For instance, Strang rejected the traditional Christian doctrine of the Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ and the Mormon doctrine of &quot;plurality of gods.&quot;A monotheist, he insisted that there was but one eternal God of all the universe, the Father, and that &quot;progression to godhood&quot; (a doctrine allegedly taught by Joseph Smith toward the end of his life);Smith, Joseph (Sunday, April 7 1844). &quot;[http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/sermons_talks_interviews/kingfolletsermon.htm King Follett Sermon]&quot; as printed in ''History of the Church'' 6: pp. 302-17.

Furthermore, Strang denied that God could do ''all'' things, and insisted that some things were as impossible for Him as for us.;Strang 1856, pg. 150.;Thus, he saw no essential conflict between science and religion, and while he never openly championed evolution, he did state that God was limited in His power by the matter He was working with and by the eons of time required to &quot;organize&quot; and shape it.;Strang 1856, pp. 150-1.;Strang spoke glowingly of a future generation who would &quot;make religion a science,&quot; to be &quot;studied by as exact rules as mathematicks.&quot;&quot;The mouth of the Seer will be opened,&quot; he prophesied, &quot;and the whole earth enlightened.&quot;;Strang 1856, pg. 85.Spelling of &quot;mathematicks&quot; as in original.;

Musing at length on the nature of sin and evil, Strang wrote that of all things that God could give to man, He could never give him ''experience''.;Strang 1856, pp. 152-3.;Thus, if &quot;free agency&quot; were to be real, said Strang, humanity must be given the opportunity to fail and to learn from its own mistakes.The ultimate goal for each human being was to willingly conform oneself to the &quot;revealed character&quot; of God in every respect, preferring good to evil not out of a fear of punishment or any desire for reward, but rather solely &quot;on account of the innate loveliness of undefiled goodness; of pure unalloyed holiness.&quot;;Strang 1856, pg. 155.;

Coronation and troubled reign on Beaver Island
Strang claimed that he was to occupy the office of king described in the Book of the Law of the Lord.;Strang 1856, pp. 168-80.;He insisted that this authority was incumbent upon all holders of Joseph Smith's prophetic office from the beginning of time,;Statement by Wingfield Watson, quoted in Smith, Heman: (1896) ''History of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,'' Independence, Missouri: Herald House. vol. 3, chapter 2, pg. 47. http://www.centerplace.org/history/ch/v3ch02.htm.; and his followers believe that Smith himself was crowned secretly as &quot;king&quot; of the Mormon church before his murder.;>;&quot;[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/strang,_the_king.htm Strang, the King]&quot;.

Rather, he claimed to be king over his church, which he saw as the true &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; prophesied in Scripture and destined to spread over all the earth.;Fitzpatrick, pg. 199.;Nor did Strang ever say that his &quot;kingdom&quot; supplanted United States sovereignty over Beaver Island.However, since his sect was the main religious body on the isle, claiming the allegiance of most of its inhabitants, Strang often asserted authority even over non-Strangites on Beaver--which ultimately caused him and his followers a great deal of grief.Furthermore, he and many of his disciples were accused of forcibly appropriating property and revenue on the island, which made him few friends among the &quot;gentiles.&quot;

On the other hand, Strang and his people lived in justified apprehension of what their nonmember neighbors, many of whom were bullying and threatening toward them, might do next.Strangites were often beaten up while going to the post office to collect their mail,;Fitzpatrick, pg. 86.; and some of their homes were robbed and even seized by &quot;gentiles&quot; while Strangite men were away.;Fitzpatrick, pg. 96.;On July 4 1850, a drunken mob of fishermen vowed to kill the &quot;Mormons&quot; or drive them out, only to be awed into submission when Strang fired a cannon (which he had secretly acquired) at them.;Strang 1854a, pp. 25-6.;Competition for business and jobs added to tensions on the island, as did the increasing Strangite monopoly on local government, made sure after Beaver and adjacent islands were attached first to Emmet County in 1853, then later organized into their own insular county of Manitou in 1855.

As a result of his coronation, together with lurid tales spread by George Adams (who had been excommunicated by Strang a few months after the ceremony), Strang was accused of treason, counterfeiting, trespass on government land, and theft, among other crimes.He was brought to trial in Detroit, Michigan, after President Millard Fillmore ordered U.S. District Attorney George Bates to investigate the rumors about Strang and his colony.; Strang's successful trial defense brought him considerable favorable press, which he leveraged to run for, and win, a seat in the Michigan state legislature as a Democrat in 1853.Facing a determined effort to deny him this seat due to the hostility of his enemies, he was permitted to address the legislature in his defense, after which the Michigan House of Representatives voted twice (first unanimously, then a second time by a 49-11 margin) to allow &quot;King Strang&quot; to join them.;Fitzpatrick, pg. 101.;

In the 1853 legislative session, Strang introduced ten bills, five of which passed.;Fitzpatrick, pg. 100.;The ''Detroit Advertiser'', on February 10 1853, wrote of Strang: &quot;Mr. Strang’s course as a member of the present Legislature, has disarmed much of the prejudices which have previously surrounded him. Whatever may be said or thought of the peculiar sect of which he is the local head, I take pleasure in stating that throughout this session he has conducted himself with the degree of decorum and propriety which have been equaled by his industry, sagacity, good temper, apparent regard for the true interests of the people, and the obligations of his official oath.&quot;;(February 10 1853). ''Detroit Advertiser''. Excerpt in &quot;[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/Strang,_The_Man.htm Mormon Persecution]&quot;. ''MormonBeliefs.com''. Retrieved on 2007-10-28.;He was reelected in 1855, and did much to organize the upper portion of Michigan's lower peninsula into counties and townships.Strang ardently fought the illegal practice of trading liquor to local Native American tribes.;Strang 1854a, pp. 15-7;;Fitzpatrick, pp. 47-8.;This made him many enemies among those non-Strangite residents of Beaver and nearby Mackinac Island who profited mightily from this illicit trade.

Assassination
James Strang made foes among his own people, too.One of these, Thomas Bedford, had been flogged for adultery on Strang's orders, and felt considerable resentment toward the &quot;king.&quot;;Fitzpatrick, pg.110.;Another, Dr. H.D. McCulloch, had been excommunicated for drunkenness and other alleged misdeeds, after previously enjoying Strang's favor and several high offices in local government.These conspired against Strang with Alexander Wentworth and Dr. J. Atkyn, who had allegedly endeavored (unsuccessfully) to blackmail the Strangites into paying his numerous bad debts.;Fitzpatrick, pp. 110-1.;A decree that female Strangites must wear &quot;bloomers&quot; only added fuel to the fire for Bedford and other malcontents on Beaver Island.;(September 25 2006). &quot;[http://www.leelanaupost.com/leelanau_history/ The Mormon kingdom on Beaver Island]&quot;.

Although Strang apparently knew that Bedford and the others were gunning for him, he seems not to have taken them very seriously.&quot;We laugh with bitter scorn at all these threats,&quot; he wrote in the ''Northern Islander'', just days before his murder.;Strang's refusal to employ a bodyguard or to carry a firearm or other weapon made him an easy target.;(August 14 1851). ''Northern Islander'' as quoted in Fitzpatrick, pg. 97.;

The ''USS Michigan'' later in its career.

On Monday, June 16 1856, Strang was waylaid around 7:00 PM on the dock at the harbor of St. James Township, Michigan|St. James, chief city of Beaver Island, by Wentworth and Bedford, who shot him in the back. All of this was carried out in full view of several officers and men of the USS ''Michigan'', a U.S. Naval vessel docked in the harbor. Not one person on board the ship made any effort to warn or to aid the intended victim.;(Friday, June 20 1856). ''Daily Northern Islander''.

Strang was hit three times: one bullet grazed his head, another lodged in his cheek and a third in his spine.One of the assassins then savagely pistol-whipped the fallen prophet before running aboard the nearby vessel with his companion, where both claimed sanctuary.;Some accused Captain McBlair of the &quot;Michigan&quot; of complicity in, or at least foreknowledge of, the assassination plot, though no hard evidence of this was ever forthcoming.;Fitzpatrick, pp. 113, 211.;;&quot;[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/Strang,%20The%20Martyred%20Prophet.htm#%A0Apostle%20Chidester%20Announces%20James%92%20Death Apostle Chidester Announces James’ Death]&quot;.

Death of a kingdom
One day before Strang's death, on what Michigan historian Byron M. Cutcheon later called &quot;the most disgraceful day in Michigan history,&quot;; a drunken mob of &quot;gentiles&quot; from Mackinac and elsewhere descended upon Beaver Island and forcibly evicted every Strangite from it.Strang's subjects on the island&amp;mdash;numbering approximately 2,600 persons;&amp;mdash;were herded onto hastily-commandeered steamers, most after being robbed of their money and other personal possessions, and unceremoniously dumped onto docks along the shores of Lake Michigan.A few moved back to Voree, while the rest scattered across the country.

Strang had refused to appoint a successor, telling his apostles to take care of their families as best they could, and await divine instruction.;&quot;[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/strang,_the_king.htm Kingdom with a Dominion]&quot;. ''MormonBeliefs.com''. Retrieved on 2007-10-28.;While his supporters endeavored to keep his church alive, Strang's unique dogma requiring his successor to be ordained by angels;Strang 1856, pp. 163-6.; handicapped his church in its search for a new prophet.Lorenzo Dow Hickey, the last of Strang's apostles, emerged as an ad-hoc leader until his death in 1900, followed by Wingfield W. Watson, a High Priest in Strang's organization (until he died in 1922).Neither of these men ever claimed Strang's office or authority, however. Left without a prophet to guide them, most of Strang's members (including all of his wives);Fitzpatrick, pg. 125.; departed his church in the years after his murder.Most later joined the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which was established in 1860.A few, however, continue to carry on Strang's mission as best they can, while awaiting a new successor to their fallen founder.

Strang's disciples today are divided into two main factions; one is led by a Presiding High Priest, who does not claim to have the authority or priesthood office possessed by Joseph Smith or James Strang.The other claims that the first faction is in error, and that by incorporating in 1961, it lost its identity as a faithful continuation of Strang's organization.This second group claims that ''it'' is the sole true remnant of James Strang's church. ;&quot;[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter%20Day%20Saints%20(Strangite).htm#The%201961%20Strangite%20Split The 1961 Strangite Split]&quot;. ''MormonBeliefs.com''.;Missionary work is no longer emphasized among the Strangites (unlike the LDS and many other Latter Day Saint sects), as they tend to believe that after three murdered prophets (Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and James Strang) God closed His dispensation to the &quot;gentiles&quot; of the West.;&quot;[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/Mormonism%20Today.htm#time%20of%20the%20Gentiles%20ended Mormonism: time of the Gentiles ended]&quot;.

While proving a key player in the 1844 succession struggle, Strang's long-term influence on the Latter Day Saint movement was minimal.His doctrinal innovations had little impact outside of his church, and he was largely ignored until recent historians began to reexamine his life and career.For all his efforts, Strang's most vital (albeit unintended) contribution to the Latter Day Saint religion turned out to be providing some of the impetus behind creation of the Reorganized Church, which became a major rival to the Utah-based LDS Church and other Latter Day Saint groups&amp;ndash;including his own.
Footnotes
* &quot;Mormon&quot; refers to either (a) the church under Joseph Smith, Jr. from 1830-44, or (b) the group that followed Brigham Young and ultimately relocated to Utah as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.It does not refer to Strang's or any other Latter Day Saint church.Unlike many other smaller Latter Day Saint factions, however, Strangites are not opposed to using the term &quot;Mormon&quot; to describe themselves.
* The Strangites use no hyphen in their church title and capitalize the &quot;D&quot; in &quot;Day&quot;, just as was done in Joseph Smith's church.
* David Whitmer and Martin Harris, two of the Three Witnesses, and Hiram Page and John Whitmer of the Eight Witnesses. 
* John Page and William Smith were apostles at Smith's death; William M'Lellin had previously been an apostle, but was excommunicated in 1838.
* George Miller, who is mentioned in the LDS ''Doctrine &amp; Covenants'' section 124: verses 20, 62 and 70.
* This organization is now called the Community of Christ.It is still the second-largest faction in the Latter Day Saint movement.
* Strangites still use these terms today, as do members of some other Latter Day Saint groups.
* No apostles currently remain in Strang's organization, as all Strangite apostles must be appointed by a Strangite prophet.The highest current office in Strang's church is that of High Priest (in the &quot;incorporated&quot; faction) or Elder (in the other).
* The first group does not have a website; the second has two: http://www.strangite.org and http://www.mormonbeliefs.com.
