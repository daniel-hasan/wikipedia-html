The Ideal Home Show (formerly called the Ideal Home Exhibition) is an annual event run by the ''Daily Mail'' in London. 

Its goal is to bring together everything associated with having an &quot;ideal home&quot;, such as the latest inventions for the modern house. 

The first exhibition was held in 1908 at the Olympia exhibition centre, with sections dedicated to &quot;phases of home life&quot; such as construction, food and cookery, furniture and decoration. Demonstrations andcontests included an Arts and Crafts competition and a competition to design the &quot;Ideal Home&quot;. Wareham Smith, advertising manager of the Daily Mail, founded the exhibition as a marketing event for the newspaper. It was often visited by celebrities and royalty.

By the late 20th century the event was criticised for having dropped its educational aims in favour of a solely commercial purpose. Attendance declined but recovered again from the mid 1990s.
