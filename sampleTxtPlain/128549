History
Third Street looking north


Prior to settlement by Europeans or Americans, the area where the city now sits — at the forks of the Red River and Red Lake River — had been an important meeting and trading point for Native Americans. Early French explorers, fur trappers, and traders called the area ''Les Grandes Fourches'' meaning &quot;The Grand Forks&quot;. By the 1740s, ''Les Grandes Fourches'' was an important trading post for French fur trappers.; A U.S. post office was established on the site on June 15, 1870 and the name was changed to &quot;Grand Forks.&quot;; Alexander Griggs, a steamboat captain, is regarded as being &quot;The Father of Grand Forks.&quot;;; Griggs' steamboat froze in the Red River on a voyage in late 1870, forcing the captain and his crew to spend the winter camping at Grand Forks. Griggs platted the community in 1875 and Grand Forks was officially incorporated on February 22, 1881.; The city quickly grew after the arrival of the Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway in 1880 and the Northern Pacific Railway in 1887.;; In 1883, the University of North Dakota was established, six years before North Dakota was formally recognized as an independent state born from the Dakota Territory.;
Great Northern depot
The first half of the 1900s saw steady growth and the development of new neighborhoods farther south and west of Downtown Grand Forks. The 1920s saw the construction of the state-owned North Dakota Mill and Elevator on the north side of the city.;; In 1954, Grand Forks was chosen as the site for an Air Force base.;; Grand Forks Air Force Base brought thousands of new jobs and residents to the community. The military base and the University of North Dakota would become integral pieces of the city's economy. The second half of the 20th century saw Grand Forks spreading further away from the older part of town.; Interstate 29 was built on the western side of the city and two enclosed shopping malls – South Forks Plaza and Columbia Mall – were built on the south side.;;

The city was struck by a severe flood in 1997, causing extensive damage.; With Fargo upstream from the bulk of the waters and Winnipeg with its flood control structures, Grand Forks became the hardest hit city in the Red River Valley. During the height of the flooding, a major fire also destroyed eleven buildings in the downtown area. Many neighborhoods had to be demolished to make way for a new levee system, which was ultimately completed ten years later. The land bordering the Red River was turned into a massive park known as the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. Since the flood, Grand Forks has seen both public and private developments throughout town. Two new, large sports venues opened in 2001, including the Alerus Center; and the Ralph Engelstad Arena.; In 2007, the Winnipeg-based Canad Inns hotel chain opened a 13-story hotel and waterpark adjacent to the Alerus Center.;; As of 2007, Grand Forks has a larger population than it did before the 1997 flood and area employment and taxable sales have also surpassed pre-flood levels.;;

Geography
Flood memorial
Grand Forks is located at(47.912326, -97.054860), 74 miles north of the Fargo-Moorhead area;; and 145 miles south of Winnipeg, Manitoba.;; Grand Forks is situated on the western bank of the Red River of the North in an area known as the Red River Valley. The term &quot;forks&quot; refers to the forking of the Red River with the Red Lake Riverlocated near downtown Grand Forks.; According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 49.9 km² (19.2 mi²), all land. Since it is in one of the flattest parts of the world, the city has few differences in elevation.; There are no lakes in the city limits of Grand Forks, but the meandering Red River and the English Coulee flow through the community and provide some break in the terrain.;; The Red River Valley is the result of an ancient glacier carving its way south during the last Ice Age. Once the glacier receded, it formed a glacial lake called Lake Agassiz. The ancient beaches can still be seen as rolling hills west of the city.;;

=Climate=


Due to its location in the Great Plains and its distance from both mountains and oceans, the city has an extreme continental climate. This type of climate is distinguished by four very distinct seasons and great variation in temperatures over very short periods of time. As there are no nearby mountain ranges or bodies of water to ameliorate the climatic conditions, Grand Forks lies exposed to numerous weather systems including bitterly cold Arctic high pressure systems. The city is known for its long, cold, and snowy winters. In sharp contrast, summers are warm to hot and often quite humid with frequent thunderstorms. Depending on the year, warm weather can continue beyond to October, or come to an abrupt end soon after Labor Day. Spring and autumn are short and highly variable seasons. The lowest temperature ever recorded was -43°F (-42°C) on January 30, 2004 and the highest temperature ever recorded was 109°F (43°C) on July 6, 1936.

Cityscape

Map of the city of Grand Forks
Grand Forks has several distinct neighborhoods. The area adjacent to the Red River developed first so this is where some of the oldest neighborhoods, including the downtown area, can be found. The area between downtown and the University of North Dakota campus was another early growth area and historic properties can be found here as well.

Downtown Grand Forks is the oldest part of the city and thus contains many historic buildings.;; It is the governmental center of the city and county. It is also used as a gathering place for large festivals and a weekly farmers' market during summer months.;; Recently, city leaders and developers have announced plans to convert older buildings into high-end condos and apartments, and to construct new buildings for the same purpose.;; Located directly south of downtown, the streets of the Near Southside Historic District are lined with classic houses.;; Reeves Drive was once one of the most fashionable neighborhoods in the city and, to this day, it is still the home of many old mansions exhibiting several unique architectural styles.;; Also in this neighborhood are areas of original granitoid paving, several historic churches, and the Lincoln Drive Park. The Near Southside neighborhood was granted the ''historic district'' designation by the National Register of Historic Places.;

In general, the newer neighborhoods of Grand Forks are in the southern and western parts of town. The 32nd Avenue South corridor has been the commercial center of the city since the Columbia Mall opened in 1978. Many big box stores, as well as hotels and restaurants, are now located along the avenue.;; A large strip mall, called the Grand Forks Marketplace, opened in 2001 near the Columbia Mall. University Village is a new commercial district that was built on vacant lands owned by the University of North Dakota.;;; The centerpiece of the Village is the Ralph Engelstad Arena, which is used by the University's Fighting Sioux hockey team. All the buildings in the Village have been built in a similar style to buildings on the nearby UND campus. The area now includes restaurants and stores, as well as the University bookstore. In 2006, a new Wellness Center for UND students opened on the Village's west side.;;

Economy
The economy of Grand Forks is not dominated by any one industry or sector. While agriculture continues to play a role in the area's economy, the city of Grand Forks now has a relatively diverse economy that includes public and private employers in sectors such as education, defense, health care, manufacturing, and food processing.;; The state and federal governments operate two of the largest employers in the Grand Forks area. The University of North Dakota, located in the heart of the city, is the largest employer in the metropolitan area.; Grand Forks Air Force Base, just west of the city, employs a large number of civilian workers in addition to its enlisted personnel. Altru Health System is the largest private employer in Grand Forks.;
Employees at LM Glasfiber work on a giant blade for a wind turbine
Major manufacturers in Grand Forks include wind turbine manufacturer LM Glasfiber;; and small aircraft manufacturer Cirrus Design.;; Major food producers include potato processor J. R. Simplot Company;; and the state-owned North Dakota Mill and Elevator which is the largest flour mill in the United States.;; Amazon.com;; and SEI Information Technologies;; both operate call centers in Grand Forks. Other large private employers in the city include the locally owned Alerus Financial branch of banks and the locally owned Hugo's chain of supermarkets.;; 

The retail and service sector is also an important part of the economy. The historic center of shopping in Grand Forks was the downtown area. Today, downtown is home to small shops and restaurants and south Grand Forks has become the major retail district in the city.; Grand Forks has three large shopping centers. The oldest, Grand Cities Mall, is located on South Washington Street and contains mainly small, locally owned stores as well as a Kmart. With about 80 stores, the area's largest indoor mall is Columbia Mall which is anchored by Macy's, Sears, J.C. Penney, and a large food court. The newest major shopping center in the city is the Grand Forks Marketplace power center mall which features SuperTarget, Best Buy, Lowe's, Gordmans, and several smaller stores. Depending on the relative strength of the Canadian dollar versus the American dollar, the Greater Grand Forks area attracts large numbers of tourist shoppers from Manitoba and especially from Winnipeg.;;

=Economic development=
The city government is actively involved in the economic development process, helping existing firms grow and attracting new ones. A portion of sales tax revenues is set aside for this, some of it going into the Grand Forks Growth Fund.;; Companies can request low-interest loans or grants from this fund provided they meet certain criteria, such as paying a relatively high wage and doing most of their business outside the city's trade region. The city also contributes to the Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation (EDC), a public-private organization that also receives funding from banks and other major businesses.;; The EDC plays a consulting role for businesses, such as identifying suitable sites for expansion or assembling public funding packages. Its other key role is to vet businesses to see if they are suitable for funding by the Growth Fund.

Community leaders have long seen UND as an &quot;economic engine&quot; for the city. Besides its regular faculty, it also has business-like components such as the Energy and Environmental Research Center. UND hosts a technology incubator called the Center for Innovation. More recently, the University has been working to commercialize its research. A major thrust in that direction is the construction of a research park on the western fringes of the campus.; Another potential economic opportunity for the city is the addition of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission to Grand Forks Air Force Base. The base currently hosts KC-135 Stratotankers, which will gradually be transferred to other bases around the country.;;

|}

Grand Forks has an active sister city program designed to encourage cultural and economic exchanges.;; Grand Forks' first sister city was Ishim in the Soviet Union. The relationship with the Siberian city formally began in 1984 during the Cold War. Sometime in the late 1990s, however, political and economic turmoil in Russia ended the relationship.;; While the relationship with Ishim faded, Grand Forks found a new sister in Awano, Japan. An informal relationship began in 1994 when the school districts of both cities began exchanging students. In 1998, the two formally proclaimed themselves sister cities. The most concrete evidence of the relationship between the two is a Japanese rock garden in Grand Forks' Sertoma Park and a sculpture of an American bison in an Awano park.;; However, the annexation of Awano by a larger city has led to the end of the sister city relationship.;; Grand Forks' relationship with Dickinson, North Dakota began in 2002, when delegations from each city visited the other.;; Grand Forks Mayor Michael Brown has said he thinks having friends in western North Dakota, which typically has diverging interests from eastern cities, could help at the state legislature.;; Sarpsborg, Norway became a sister city in 2005 following several exchanges among leaders from both cities. The city became interested in building a relationship with Sarpsborg because many Grand Forks residents have Norwegian heritage.;;
