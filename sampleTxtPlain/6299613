The 2006 Lebanon War, known in Lebanon as the July War;; (Arabic: حرب تموز ''Ḥarb Tammuz (month)#Other uses|Tammūz'') and in Israel as the Second Lebanon War (Hebrew: מלחמת לבנון השנייה ''Milkhemet Levanon Ha-Shnía''),;See, e.g., Yaakov Katz, &quot;Halutz officers discuss war strategy,&quot; ''Jerusalem Post'', Sept. 5, 2006, p. 2; was a 34-day military conflict in Lebanon and northern Israel. Theprincipal parties were Hezbollah paramilitary forces and the Israeli military. The conflict started on 12 July 2006, and continued until a United Nations-brokered ceasefire went into effect on 14 August 2006, though it formally ended on 8 September 2006 when Israel lifted its naval blockade of Lebanon.

Background

The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) had engaged in cross-border attacks from southern Lebanon into Israel as far back as 1968, and the area became a significant base following the arrival of the PLO leadership and its Fatah brigade after their 1971 expulsion from Jordan. Demographic tensions were running high over the Lebanese National Pact, which divided governmental powers among religious groups, leading in part to the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990). Concurrently, Syria began a 29 year military occupation. Israel's 1978 invasion of Lebanon failed to stem the Palestinian attacks, but Israel invaded Lebanon again in 1982 and forcibly expelled the PLO.;; Israel withdrew to a borderland buffer zone in southern Lebanon, held with the aid of proxy militants in the South Lebanon Army (SLA).;; In 1985, a Lebanese Shi'a militia calling itself Hezbollah declared an armed struggle to end the 1982-2000 South Lebanon conflict|Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory.;; When the Lebanese civil war ended and other warring factions agreed to disarm, Hezbollah and the SLA refused. Combat with Hezbollah weakened Israeli resolve and led to a collapse of the SLA and an early Israeli withdrawal in 2000 to their side of the UN designated border. Citing Israeli control of the disputed Shebaa farms region and the incarceration of Lebanese prisoners in Israel, Hezbollah continued cross border attacks, and used the tactic of seizing soldiers from Israel as leverage for a prisoner exchange in 2004,;; though it also continues to call for Hezbollah#Position on Israel|Israel's destruction.;;

Beginning of conflict



At around 9:00 AM local time (06:00 UTC) on 12 July 2006, Hezbollah launched diversionary rocket attacks toward Israeli military positions near the coast and near the border village of Zar'it;; as well as on the Israeli town of Shlomi and other villages.;; At the same time, a Hezbollah ground contingent crossed the border into Israeli territory and attacked two Israeli armoured Humvees patrolling on the Israeli side of the Israel-Lebanon border, near Zar'it, killing three, injuring two, and seizing two Israeli soldiers(Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev).;;; Five more Israeli soldiers were killed later and a tank was destroyed on the Lebanese side of the border during an unsuccessful attempt to rescue the two seized soldiers.

Hezbollah named the attack &quot;Zar'it-Shtula incident|Operation Truthful Promise&quot; after leader Hassan Nasrallah's public pledges over the prior year and a half to seize Israeli soldiers and swap them for convicted murderer Samir Kuntar, convicted spy Nasim Nisr, Ali Faratan, and Yahya Skaf, whom Hezbollah claims was arrested in Israel (Israel denies this).;
;;; Nasrallah claimed that Israel had broken a previous deal to release these prisoners, and since diplomacy had failed, violence was the only remaining option.;; Nasrallah declared: &quot;No military operation will return the Israeli captured soldiers…The prisoners will not be returned except through one way: indirect negotiations and a trade of prisoners.&quot;;
;

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert described the seizure of the soldiers as an &quot;act of war&quot; by the sovereign country of Lebanon,;;;; stating that &quot;Lebanon will bear the consequences of its actions&quot;;; and promising a &quot;very painful and far-reaching response.&quot;;; Israel blamed the Lebanese government for the raid, as it was carried out from Lebanese territory and Hezbollah had two ministers serving in the Lebanese cabinet at that time.;;
In response, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora denied any knowledge of the raid and stated that he did not condone it.;;;; An emergency meeting of the Lebanese government reaffirmed this position.;; Less than a week later, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud promised to stand by Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.;; 

The Israel Defense Forces attacked targets within Lebanon with artillery and airstrikes hours before the Israeli Cabinet met to discuss a response. Later that day, the Cabinet decided to authorize the Prime Minister, the Defense Minister and their deputies to pursue the plan which they had proposed for action within Lebanon. The decision also emphasized Prime Minister Olmert's demand that the Israeli Defense Force avoid civilian casualties whenever possible.;; Israel's chief of staff Dan Halutz said, &quot;if the soldiers are not returned, we will turn Lebanon's clock back 20 years&quot;;; while the head of Israel's Northern Command Udi Adam said, &quot;this affair is between Israel and the state of Lebanon. Where to attack? Once it is inside Lebanon, everything is legitimate -- not just southern Lebanon, not just the line of Hezbollah posts.&quot;; On July 12 2006, the Israeli Cabinet promised that Israel would &quot;respond aggressively and harshly to those who carried out, and are responsible for, today's action&quot;.;Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs (July 12, 2006). [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2006/Special%20Cabinet%20Communique%20-%20Hizbullah%20attack%2012-Jul-2006 &quot;Special Cabinet Communique - Hizbullah attack&quot;]. Retrieved April 8, 2007.; The Cabinet's communique stated, in part, that the &quot;Lebanese Government [was] responsible for the action that originated on its soil.&quot;; A retired Israeli Army Colonel explained that the rationale behind the attack was to create a rift between the Lebanese population and Hezbollah supporters by exacting a heavy price from the elite in Beirut.;;

On July 16, the Israeli Cabinet released a communique explaining that, although Israel had engaged in military operations ''within'' Lebanon, its war was not against the Lebanese government. The communique stated: &quot;Israel is not fighting Lebanon but the terrorist element there, led by Nasrallah and his cohorts, who have made Lebanon a hostage and created Syrian- and Iranian-sponsored terrorist enclaves of murder.&quot;;;

When asked in August about the proportionality of the response, Prime Minister Olmert stated that the &quot;war started not only by killing eight Israeli soldiers and abducting two but by shooting Katyusha and other rockets on the northern cities of Israel on that same morning. Indiscriminately.&quot; He added &quot;no country in Europe would have responded in such a restrained manner as Israel did.&quot;;

Hezbollah action



Map showing some of the Israeli localities attacked by rockets fired from Lebanese soil as of Monday 7 August.
During the campaign Hezbollah fired between 3,970 and 4,228 rockets. About 95% of these were 122&amp;nbsp;mm (4.8&amp;nbsp;in) Katyusha artillery rockets, which carried warheads up to 30 kg (66&amp;nbsp;lb) and had a range of up to 30 km (19&amp;nbsp;mi).;;; An estimated 23% of these rockets hit built-up areas, primarily civilian in nature.;;;; Cities hit included Haifa, Hadera, Nazareth, Tiberias, Nahariya, Safed, Shaghur, Afula, Kiryat Shmona, Beit She'an, Karmiel, and Maalot, and dozens of Kibbutzim, Moshavim, and Arab citizens of Israel#Druze|Druze and Arab villages, as well as the northern West Bank.;
;;;;; Hezbollah also engaged in guerrilla warfare with the IDF, attacking from well-fortified positions. These attacks by small, well-armed units caused serious problems for the IDF, especially through the use of sophisticated Russian-made anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). According to Merkava tank program admistration, 52 Merkava main battle tanks were damaged (the vast majority by different kinds of ATGM), missiles penetrated 22 tanks, but only 5 tanks were destroyed. Hezbollah caused additional casualties using ATGMs to collapse buildings onto Israeli troops sheltering inside.;

After the initial Israeli response, Hezbollah declared an all-out military alert. Hezbollah was estimated to have 13,000 missiles at the beginning of the conflict.;; Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'' described Hezbollah as a trained, skilled, well-organized, and highly motivated infantry that was equipped with the cream of modern weaponry from the arsenals of Syria, Iran, Russia, and China.;; Lebanese satellite TV station Al-Manar reported that the attacks had included a Fajr-3 (rocket)|Fajr-3 and a Ra'ad 1, both liquid-fuel missiles developed by Iran.;
;;;;;

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah defended the attacks, saying that Hezbollah had &quot;started to act calmly, we focused on Israel[i] military bases and we didn’t attack any settlement, however, since the first day, the enemy attacked Lebanese towns and murdered civilians — Hezbollah militants had destroyed military bases, while the Israelis killed civilians and targeted Lebanon's infrastructure.&quot;;; Hezbollah apologized for shedding Muslim blood, and called on the Arabs of the Israeli city of Haifa to flee.;;
Hezbollah continued to use unguided rockets to shell northern Israel.;&quot;Israel's war With Iran&quot; by Ze'ev Schiff, ''Foreign Affairs'', November-December 2006, pp. 26-27.;

UN forces made repeated calls;; to alert Israeli forces of the danger to the UN observers, all four of whom were killed. Rescuers were shelled as they attempted to reach the post. According to an e-mail sent earlier by one of the UN observers killed in the attack, there had been numerous occasions on a daily basis where the post had come under fire from both Israeli artillery and bombing. The UN observer reportedly wrote that previous Israeli bombing near the post had not been deliberate targeting, but rather due to &quot;tactical necessity,&quot; military jargon which retired Canadian Major General Lewis MacKenzie later interpreted as indicating that Israeli strikes were aimed at Hezbollah targets extremely close to the post.

Position of Lebanon



While Israel initially held the Lebanese government responsible for the Hezbollah attacks due to Lebanon's failure to implement Resolution 1559 and disarm Hezbollah, Lebanon disavowed the raids, stating that the government of Lebanon did not condone them, and that Israel had its own history of disregarding UN resolutions.; 

On July 31, 2006, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud declared his full support for Hezbollah.;; In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on August 11, he declared Hezbollah to be &quot;complementary to the [Lebanese] army.&quot;;;

Although Israel never declared war on Lebanon,;;;; and only attacked Lebanese governmental institutions which it suspected of being used by Hezbollah,;; the Lebanese government played a crucial role in shaping the conflict. On July 14, 2006, the Prime Minister's office issued a statement that called on U.S. President George W. Bush to exert all his efforts on Israel to stop its attacks in Lebanon and reach a comprehensive ceasefire.;
; In a televised speech the next day, Siniora called for &quot;an immediate ceasefire backed by the United Nations&quot;.;; A U.S.-France draft resolution that was influenced by the Lebanese Siniora Plan and which contained provisions for Israeli withdrawal, military actions, and mutual prisoner release was rejected as inadequate. Many Lebanese accused the U.S. government of stalling the ceasefire resolution and support of Israel. In a poll conducted two weeks into the conflict, 8% of the respondents felt that the U.S. would support Lebanon, while 87% supported Hezbollah's fight against Israel.;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0728/p06s01-wome.html Israeli strikes may boost Hezbollah base]; After the attack on Qana, Siniora snubbed U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by cancelling a meeting with her and thanked Hezbollah for its &quot;sacrifices for the independence and sovereignty of Lebanon.&quot;;[http://www.globalinsight.com/SDA/SDADetail6485.htm Civilian Deaths in Lebanon Provoke International Outcry, Israel Suspends Aerial Bombardment];
On 7 August 2006 the 7-point plan was extended to include the deployment of 15,000 Lebanese Army troops to fill the void between an Israeli withdrawal and UNIFIL deployment.

During Israel's raid on Tyre, the Lebanese Army reportedly fired surface-to-air missiles at Israeli helicopters, which returned fire and destroyed a Lebanese M113 Armored Personnel Carrier.;;

Allegations of war crimes

International action and reaction

The conflict engendered worldwide concerns over infrastructure damage and the risks of escalation of the crisis, as well as mixed support and criticism of both Hezbollah and Israel.;; Governments of the United States,;; United Kingdom, Germany,;; Australia, and Canada, asserted Israel's right to self-defense. The United States government further responded by authorizing Israel's request for expedited shipment of precision-guided bombs, but did not announce the decision publicly.;; United States President George W. Bush declared the conflict to be a part of the War on Terrorism.;;;; On July 20 2006, the United States Congress voted overwhelmingly to support Israel's &quot;right to defend itself&quot;.;;

Among neighboring Middle Eastern nations, Iran, Syria, and Yemen voiced strong support for Hezbollah, while the Arab League, Egypt, and Jordan issued statements condemning Israel’s response;; and criticizing Hezbollah’s action.;; Saudi Arabia found Hezbollah entirely responsible.;;

Many worldwide protests and demonstrations appealed for an immediate ceasefire on both sides and expressed concern for the heavy loss of civilian life on all sides. Other demonstrations were held exclusively in favor of Lebanon or Israel. Numerous newspaper advertising campaigns, SMS and email appeals, and online petitions also occurred.;
;;;

Various foreign governments assisted the evacuation of their citizens from Lebanon.;;

Ceasefire


Terms for a ceasefire had been drawn and revised several times over the course of the conflict, yet successful agreement between the two sides took several weeks. Hezbollah maintained the desire for an unconditional ceasefire,;; while Israel insisted upon a conditional ceasefire, including the return of the two seized soldiers.;; Lebanon frequently pled for the United Nations Security Council to call for an immediate, unconditional ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.John Bolton confirmed that the US and UK, with support from several Arab leaders, delayed the ceasefire process. Outsider efforts to interfere with a ceasefire only ended when it became apparent Hezbollah would not be easily defeated.;;

On 11 August 2006 the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved UN Security Council Resolution 1701, in an effort to end the hostilities. It was accepted by the Lebanese government and Hezbollah on 12 August 2006, and by the Israeli government on 13 August 2006. The ceasefire took effect at 8:00 AM (5:00 AM GMT) on 14 August 2006.;;

Before the ceasefire, the two Hezbollah members of cabinet said that their militia would not disarm south of the Litani River, according to another senior member of the Lebanese cabinet,;; while a top Hezbollah official similarly denied any intention of disarming in the south. Israel said it would stop withdrawing from Southern Lebanon if Lebanese troops were not deployed there within a matter of days.;;

Reviews of the conflict

George W. Bush declared that Hezbollah lost the war and that &quot;There's going to be a new power in the south of Lebanon&quot;;;
Following the UN-brokered ceasefire, there were mixed responses on who had gained most in the war. Iran and Syria proclaimed a victory for Hezbollah;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/08/16/wmid116.xml Syria and Iran claim victory over West]; while the Israeli and United States administrations declared that Hezbollah lost the conflict. Initially, in a poll by an Israeli radio station, Israelis were split on the outcome with the majority believing that no one won.;; By 25 August, 63% of Israelis polled wanted Olmert to resign due to his handling of the war.;; 

British military historian John Keegan concluded that the outcome of the war was &quot;misreported as an Israeli defeat&quot; due to anti-Israel bias in the international media.;NY Sun, November 6, 2006.;

''The Economist'' concluded that by surviving this asymmetrical military conflict with Israel, Hezbollah effectively emerged with a military and political victory from this conflict.;; They cite the facts that Hezbollah was able to sustain defenses on Lebanese soil and inflict unmitigated rocket attacks on Israeli civilians in the face of a punishing air and land campaign by the IDF. Also, Israel's stated goals entering the conflict were to retrieve its two seized soldiers and destroy the military capability of Hezbollah - neither goal was accomplished.;; Hezbollah is leading the rebuilding effort in south Beirut and Lebanon using &quot;unlimited&quot; support from Iran, thereby awarding Hezbollah further political clout.;; However, given the response from Israeli military forces, which caused widespread destruction in southern Lebanon, as well as a new UN force to occupy what was formerly a Hezbollah controlled area, the conflict is generally seen as weakening Hezbollah militarily. Khairi Abaza wrote in the Lebanese English-language daily ''Daily Star'': &quot;The same strategic manipulation of public opinion can be seen in Hizbullah's 'victory' against Israel in summer 2006.

Israeli Prime Minister Olmert admitted to the Knesset that there were mistakes in the war in Lebanon,;; though he framed UN Security Council resolution 1701 as an accomplishment for Israel that would bring home the seized soldiers, and said that the operations had altered the regional strategic balance vis-à-vis Hezbollah.;; Israeli chief of staff Dan Halutz admitted to failings in the conflict.;; On 15 August, Israeli government and defense officials called for Halutz' resignation following a Dan Halutz#Investment portfolio scandal|stock scandal in which he admitted selling stocks hours before the start of the Israeli offensive.;; Halutz subsequently resigned 17 January 2007 due to criticism of his conduct during the war.

On 21 August, a group of demobilized Israel reserve soldiers and parents of soldiers killed in the fighting started a movement calling for the resignation of Ehud Olmert and the establishment of a state commission of inquiry. They set up a protest tent opposite the Knesset and grew to over 2,000 supporters by 25 August,;[http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=31&amp;ar=yoman &quot;Yoman&quot;], ''Israel Broadcasting Authority'', 25 August 2006 ; including the influential Movement for Quality Government.;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3295083,00.html &quot;Hundreds support protesting reservists&quot;], ''Ynetnews'', 24 August 2006;; On 28 August, Olmert 2006 Israeli reserve soldiers' protest#Prospects for a state commission|announced that there would be no independent state or governmental commission of inquiry, but two internal inspection probes, one to investigate the political echelon and one to examine IDF, and likely a third commission to examine the Home Front, to be announced at a later date.

Due to these pressures, on 11 October, Admoni was replaced by retired justice Eliyahu Winograd as chair of the political probe, and the probe itself was elevated to the status of governmental commission with near-state commission mandate: the Winograd Commission. On 12 September, former defense minister Moshe Arens spoke of &quot;the defeat of Israel&quot; in calling for a state committee of inquiry. He said that Israel had lost &quot;to a very small group of people, 5000 Hezbollah fighters, which should have been no match at all for the IDF,&quot; and stated that the conflict could have &quot;some very fateful consequences for the future.&quot; Disclosing his intent to shortly resign, Ilan Harari, the IDF's chief education officer, stated at a conference of senior IDF officers that Israel lost the war, becoming the first senior active duty officer to publicly state such an opinion.;; IDF Major General Yiftah Ron-Tal|Yiftah Ron Tal, on 4 October 2006 became the second and highest ranking serving officer to express his opinion that the IDF failed &quot;to win the day in the battle against Hezbollah,&quot; as well as calling for Lt.

The fighting resulted in a huge financial setback for Lebanon, with estimates ranging from US$7 to US$15 billion;; in direct costs while the cost for Israel is put at US$1.6 - US$3 billion.;; This has prompted a commentator in the London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat to question the claims of victory by Hezbollah.;; According to one analyst in the Associated Press, the main casualty was the fragile unity between Lebanon's sectarian and political groups,;; though an ''Asia Times'' piece points to Free Patriotic Movement head Michel Aoun's support for Hezbollah and provision of housing for displaced Shi'a as evidence for strengthened relations.

Lebanese desire to emigrate has increased since the war. Over a fifth of Shias, a quarter of Sunnis, and nearly half of Maronites have expressed the desire to leave Lebanon. Nearly a third of such Maronites have already submitted visa applications to foreign embassies, and another 60,000 Christians have already fled, as of April 2007. Lebanese Christians are concerned that their influence is waning, fear the apparent rise of radical Islam, and worry of potential Sunni-Shia rivalry.;;

Media controversy



Several media commentators and journalists have alleged an intentionally distorted coverage of the events, in favour of Hezbollah, by means of photo manipulation, staging by Hezbollah or by journalists, and false or misleading captioning.;;

On 18 July 2006 Hezbollah Press Officer Hussein Nabulsi took CNN's Nic Robertson on an exclusive tour of southern Beirut. Robertson noted that despite his minder's anxiety about explosions in the area, it was clear that Hezbollah had sophisticated media relations and were in control of the situation. Hezbollah designated the places that they went to, and the journalists &quot;certainly didn't have time to go into the houses or lift up the rubble to see what was underneath.&quot; According to his reports, there was no doubt that the bombs were hitting Hezbollah facilities, and while there appeared to be &quot;a lot of civilian damage, a lot of civilian properties,&quot; he reiterated that he couldn't verify the civilian nature of the destroyed buildings.;;

CNN's Charlie Moore described a Hezbollah press tour of a bombed-out area in southern Beirut on 23 July 2006 as a &quot;dog-and-pony show&quot; due to perceived staging, misrepresentation of the nature of the destroyed areas, and strict directives about when and with whom interviews could take place.;;

In the same interview aired on 23 July 2006, CNN's John Roberts, who was reporting from an Israeli artillery battery on the Lebanese border, stated that he had to take everything he was told — either by the IDF or Hezbollah — &quot;with a grain of salt,&quot; citing mutual recriminations of civilian targeting which he was unable to verify independently.;

Reuters withdrew over 900 photographs by Adnan Hajj, a Lebanese freelance photographer, after he admitted to digitally adding and darkening smoke spirals in photographs of an attack on Beirut.;;

Photographs submitted to Reuters and Associated Press showed one Lebanese woman mourning on two different pictures taken by two photographers, allegedly taken two weeks apart.;; While it is &quot;common practice to send more than one photographer to an incident&quot;,;; questions remained as to whether the images were wrongly captioned or deliberately staged.

On 24 October, six Israeli F-16's flew over a German Navy vessel patrolling off Israel's coast just south of the Lebanese border. The German Defence Ministry said that the planes had given off infrared decoys and one of the aircraft had fired two shots into the air, which had not been specifically aimed. The Israeli military said that a German helicopter took off from the vessel without having coordinated this with Israel, and denied vehemently having fired any shots at the vessel and said &quot;as of now&quot; it also had no knowledge of the jets launching flares over it. Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz telephoned his German counterpart Franz Josef Jung to clarify that 'Israel has no intention to carry out any aggressive actions' against the German peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, who are there as part of UNIFIL to enforce an arms embargo against Hezbollah. Germany confirmed the consultations, and that both sides were interested in maintaining good cooperation.;;;;;;

On 1 December 2006, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan submitted a report to the Security Council president maintaining &quot;there were no serious incidents or confrontations&quot; since the cease-fire in August 2006. He did, however, note that peacekeepers reported air violations by Israel &quot;almost on a daily basis,&quot; which Israel maintained were a security measure related to continuing Syrian and Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah, and evidence of the presence of unauthorized armed personnel, assets, and weapons in Lebanon.
