John Lee Richmond (or simply Lee Richmond) (born May 5, 1857, in Sheffield, Ohio - died October 1, 1929, in Toledo, Ohio) was a left-handed pitcher who threw the first perfect game in major league baseball history.He played for the Worcester, Massachusetts Worcesters (no nickname).The game was played at the Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds near the intersection of Sever St. and Highland St. in Worcester.The game was played on June 12, 1880, and the second perfect game came just 5 days later, pitched by John Montgomery Ward.In his perfect game, Richmond struck out five, allowed only three balls to be hit out of the infield, and, remarkably, got one of his 27 outs when the right fielder threw the batter out at first base.Worcester beat Cleveland 1-0, with the only run scoring on an error by the Cleveland second baseman.

Sometimes called J. Lee Richmond, in a six-season career, statistics show that he was 75-100 with a 3.06 ERA in 191 games, 179 starts. Of those starts, 161 were complete games, 8 of them shutouts, and one of those his famous perfect game. He had 552 strike outs in 1,583 career innings pitched.After leaving baseball, Richmond became a doctor and later a professor.
