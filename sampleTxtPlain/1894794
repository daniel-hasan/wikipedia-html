Ulf Lundkvist (born 1952) is a Swedish comic creator, illustrator, and painter. A nostalgia buff in love with the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, Lundkvist depicts the &quot;old Sweden&quot; with humor and affection, small towns and countryside, anachronistic places where time seem to stand still. 

Lundkvist's most famous comic is probably the strip ''Assar'', the absurd story about a hot dog who gains sentience and escapes his fate to seek adventure.
