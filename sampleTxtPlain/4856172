''Nepenthes inermis'' () is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to Sumatra. The specific epithet ''inermis'' is Latin for &quot;unarmed&quot; and probably refers to the upper pitchers of this species, which are unique in that they completely lack a peristome.

Botanical history
''N. inermis'' was first collected on September 7, 1918, by H. A. B. Bünnemeijer on Mount Talang, at an altitude of 2590 m above sea level. Two further collections were made by Bünnemeijer on Bukit Gombak on November 16, 1918, at 2300 m and 2330 m. A fourth specimen was taken on April 26, 1920, from an elevation of 1800 m on Mount Kerintji.;Danser, B.H. 1928. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. ''Bulletin de Jardin de Botanique, Buitenzorg'', Série III, 9(3–4): 249–438.; This final specimen, ''Bünnemeijer 9695'', was later designated as the lectotype of ''N. inermis'' by Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek.;Jebb, M.H.P. &amp; M.R. Cheek 1997. A Skeletal Revision of ''Nepenthes'' (Nepenthaceae). ''Blumea'' 42(1): 1–106.;

Herbarium specimens of ''N. inermis'' illustrated by B.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp; Danser

''N. dubia'' was first illustrated in an issue of ''De Tropische Natuur'' published in 1927.;Danser, B.H. 1927. Indische bekerplanten. ''De Tropische Natuur'' 16: 197–205.; A year later, B. H. Danser formally described ''N. inermis'' in his seminal monograph &quot;The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies&quot;. He wrote: &quot;This new species is easily distinguishable from all others by the peculiar pitchers without peristome and with very narrow lid. Probably it is most nearly related to ''N. Bongso''.&quot;;

Several of the specimens collected by Bünnemeijer were labeled with the local vernacular names ''galoe-galoe antoe'' and ''kandjong baroek''. Danser noted that these originate from the Minangkabau language and are also used to refer to other species, but stated that their meaning was not clear to him.;

In 1986, Mitsuru Hotta and Rusjdi Tamin included plant material belonging to ''N. dubia'' and ''N. inermis'' in their description of ''N. bongso''.;Tamin, R. &amp; M. Hotta 1986. ''Nepenthes'' di Sumatera: The genus ''Nepenthes'' of the Sumatra Island. In: M. Hotta (ed.) ''Diversity and Dynamics of Plant Life in Sumatra 1''. Kyoto University, Japan. pp. 75–109.;;Clarke, C.M. 2001. ''Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia''.Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.;

In a 1993 study of ''Nepenthes'' prey and pitcher infauna, the same authors, together with M. Kato and T. Itino, identified ''N. inermis'' from Mount Gadut as ''N. bongso''.;Kato, M., M. Hotta, R. Tamin &amp; T. Itino 1993. Inter- and intra-specific variation in prey assemblages and inhabitant communities in ''Nepenthes'' pitchers in Sumatra. ''Tropical Zoology'' 6: 11–25.;;

Despite this taxonomic confusion, ''N. bongso'' differs considerably in pitcher morphology from ''N. inermis'' and is not easily confused with it.

Description
''N. inermis'' is a climbing plant. The stem can reach 5 m in length and is up to 5 mm in diameter. It is cylindrical-triangular in cross section. Internodes are up to 10 cm long.;

A climbing stem of ''N. inermis'' with upper pitchers

Leaves are wikt:sessile|sessile and wikt:coriaceous|coriaceous. The lamina is wikt:lanceolate|lanceolate-wikt:spathulate|spathulate in form. It may be up to 12 cm long and 3 cm wide. It has an acute or obtuse apex and is gradually wikt:attenuate|attenuate towards the base, which clasps the stem and is not wikt:decurrent|decurrent. Three longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. wikt:pinnate|Pinnate veins are wikt:reticulate|reticulate. Tendrils can be up to 15 cm long and may or may not have a curl.;

Rosette and lower pitchers are rarely produced. They are wikt:infundibular|infundibular in the lower two-thirds to three-quarters, and ovoid above. They are distinctly constricted just below the peristome. Terrestrial pitchers grow to 8 cm in height and 3 cm in width. Fringed wings are usually absent, but may be present in the upper part. The pitcher mouth is round and horizontal, and raised slightly towards the rear. The peristome is cylindrical, up to 3 mm wide, and bears indistinct teeth. The lid or operculum is ovate and lacks appendages. An unbranched spur (≤4 mm long) is inserted at the base of the lid.;

Unopened upper pitcher

The unusual upper pitchers of ''N. inermis'' are larger than its lower pitchers, growing to 9 cm in height and 5 cm in width.; They gradually or abruptly arise from the ends of the tendrils, forming a 10 to 20 mm wide curve.; They are tubular to infundibular in the lower two-thirds with laterally appressed pitcher walls. As in ''N. dubia'', there is almost no gap between the walls in mature pitchers. The upper part of the pitcher is widely infundibular throughout. Wings are reduced to ribs in upper pitchers. The mouth is round and either horizontal or slightly raised at the front and rear. Mature upper pitchers completely lack a peristome, a trait that is unique to this species. The lid is very long, narrow, and wikt:cuneiform|cuneiform. It is never reflexed beyond 90 degrees relative to the mouth.;

''N. inermis'' has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle may be up to 5 cm long. The rachis grows to 15 cm in length, although it is usually shorter in female inflorescences. Pedicels are bracteolate and up to 8 mm long. Sepals are oblong-lanceolate and up to 3 mm long.;

Young parts of the plant, such as developing pitchers, are covered in a dense indumentum. However, most hairs are wikt:caducous|caducous and mature parts are virtually wikt:glabrous|glabrous. An exception to this are the hairs on the ovary and some other parts of the inflorescence, which may be persistent.;

The stem, inflorescence and tendrils are characteristically purplish-red in most plants. The lamina is green, often with a red midrib. Pitchers are yellowish-green.; Danser described the colour of herbarium specimens as &quot;blackish in all parts&quot;.;

Ecology
''N. inermis'' is endemic to a number peaks in the Barisan Mountains that line the western side of Sumatra. More specifically, it is known only from the Indonesian provinces of West Sumatra and Jambi. ''N. inermis'' has an altitudinal distribution of 1500 to 2600 m above sea level. It usually grows as an epiphyte in mossy forest, but also occurs terrestrially in stunted upper montane vegetation above 2000 m.;

Substantial populations of this species are present on Mount Talang, Mount Gadut, and Mount Belirang. ''N. inermis'' is particularly abundant on the western slopes of the latter, where it grows terrestrially.;

The conservation status of ''N. inermis'' is listed as Vulnerable on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.;Schnell, D., P. Catling, G. Folkerts, C. Frost, R. Gardner, ''et al.'' 2000. [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/40112/all ''Nepenthes inermis'']. ''2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species''. IUCN 2006. Retrieved on 11 May 2006. Listed as Vulnerable (VU A1c v2.3).;

Carnivory
''N. inermis'' produces extremely thick mucilaginous pitcher liquid. It is so viscous that if a pitcher is held upside down, the fluid will pour out forming an unbroken stream several metres in length.;Hopkins, M., R. Maulder &amp; B.[R.] Salmon 1990.''Carnivorous Plant Newsletter'' 19(1–2): 19–28.;;Salmon, B.[R.] 1993.''Carnivorous Plant Newsletter'' 22(1–2): 11–12.; This fluid coats the entire inner surfaces of the pitchers in a thin film. The pitchers of ''N. inermis'' function not only as Carnivorous_plant#Pitfall_traps|pitfall traps but also as Carnivorous_plant#Flypaper_traps|flypaper traps, with the sticky inner walls trapping flying insects above the surface of the fluid.;;Rice, B. 2007. Carnivorous plants with hybrid trapping strategies. ''Carnivorous Plant Newsletter'' 36(1): 23–27.; The fluid also acts as a lubricant, allowing prey items to easily slide down into the bottom of the pitcher cup.;

The upper pitchers of ''N. inermis'' are frequenty tipped over during downpours. The rainwater that accumulates in them is lost, but the extremely viscous fluid, together with the laterally appressed walls, ensure that the contents is retained. No longer holding heavy rainwater, the pitchers quickly spring back to an upright position.;;Clarke, C.[M.] 1997.''Carnivorous Plant Newsletter'' 26(1): 4–10.;

A similar trapping method may be employed by related species such as ''N. dubia'', which also produce very viscous pitcher fluid.;

''N. inermis'' pitchers mostly trap flying insects, particularly flies of the suborders Nematocera and Brachycera. However, they do not normally contain invertebrate pitcher infauna.;

It has been suggested that glands on the lid secrete compounds that intoxicate visiting insects, such that they lose their footing and fall into the pitcher.;;

''N. inermis'' belongs to a group of closely related montane Sumatran species that includes ''N. dubia'', ''N. flava'',;Wistuba, A., J. Nerz &amp; A. Fleischmann 2007. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/article?title=nepenthes+flava&amp;title_type=tka&amp;year_from=1998&amp;year_to=2007&amp;database=1&amp;pageSize=20&amp;index=1''Nepenthes flava'', a new species of Nepenthaceae from the northern part of Sumatra]. ''Blumea'' 52: 159–163.; ''N. jacquelineae'', ''N. jamban'',;Lee, C.C., Hernawati &amp; P. Akhriadi 2006. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/nhn/blumea/2006/00000051/00000003/art00007 Two new species of ''Nepenthes'' (Nepenthaceae) from North Sumatra]. ''Blumea'' 51(3): 561–568.; ''N. talangensis'', and ''N. tenuis''. These species are characterised by infundibular upper pitchers and highly viscous pitcher fluid.

''N. inermis'' is thought to be most closely related to ''N. dubia''. However, it is easily distinguished from that species as it completely lacks a peristome in its upper pitchers unlike the latter.The pitchers are also usually green, while those of ''N. dubia'' tend to be yellow to orange in colour.;

In 2001, Charles Clarke performed a cladistic analysis of the ''Nepenthes'' species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia using 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon. The following is part of the resultant cladogram, showing &quot;Clade 1&quot;, which has 51% bootstrap support. Its most strongly supported subclade is the sister pair of ''N. inermis'' and ''N. dubia'', having 95% support.;

Natural hybrids
=''Nepenthes × pyriformis''=


''N. inermis'' is known to hybridise with ''N. talangensis'' on the upper slopes of Mount Talang, where the two species grow sympatrically. ''N. talangensis'' was only described as a distinct species in 1994.;Nerz, J. &amp; A. Wistuba 1994. [http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/Species/v23n4p101_114.html Five new taxa of ''Nepenthes'' (Nepenthaceae) from North and West Sumatra]. ''Carnivorous Plant Newsletter'' 23(4): 101–114.; Prior to this it was placed within ''N. bongso'' and some of the older literature identifies this hybrid as ''N. bongso'' &amp;times; ''N. inermis''.;

''N. inermis'' &amp;times; ''N. talangensis'' has been the subject of taxonomic confusion in the past. In an article published in 1973 on the ''Nepenthes'' of Borneo, Singapore, and Sumatra, botanist Shigeo Kurata incorrectly identified specimens of this hybridas belonging to ''N. dubia''.;Kurata, S. 1973. ''Nepenthes'' from Borneo, Singapore and Sumatra. ''Gardens' Bulletin Singapore'' 26(2): 227–232.;;

In 1997, Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek published their monograph &quot;A Skeletal Revision of ''Nepenthes'' (Nepenthaceae)&quot;, in which they referred to ''N. dubia'' plant material from Mount Talang (''Kurata s.n.'' SING).; Charles Clarke later identified ''Kurata s.n.'' as representing ''N. inermis'' &amp;times; ''N. talangensis''.

The natural hybrid is similar to ''N. dubia'', but can be distinguished on the basis of several stable characters. The hybrid has a wider pitcher lid that is never relfexed beyond 90 degrees and the pitcher cup is not appressed in the lower parts as in ''N. dubia''. In addition, the mouth of ''N. inermis'' &amp;times; ''N. talangensis'' is raised towards the back as opposed to being horizontal.;

In 2001, Kurata described this hybrid as a new species, ''N. pyriformis''.;Kurata, S. 2001. Two new species of ''Nepenthes'' from Sumatra (Indonesia) and Mindanao (Philippines). ''Journal of the Insectivorous Plant Society (Japan)'' 52(2): 30–34.; Clarke rejected this interpretation in his monograph ''Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia'', published the same year. Clarke found that the type specimen of ''N. pyriformis'', ''Kurata &amp; Mikil 4230'' NDC, matches the appearance of ''N. inermis'' &amp;times; ''N. talangensis'' &quot;in most respects&quot;.;

=Other hybrids=
Where their ranges overlap, ''N. inermis'' is also known to hybridise with ''N. singalana'' and ''N. spathulata''.;
