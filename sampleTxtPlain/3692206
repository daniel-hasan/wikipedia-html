The Woolly Bugger is so effective, it should be banned from some watersheds.I suspect its effectiveness is due to its resemblance to so many edible creatures in the water--nymphs, leeches, salamanders, or even small sculpins.Its tail undulating behind a fiber, bubble-filled body is just too much for most fish to resist.I just looks like a meal!-Bill Hunter in ''The Professionals' Favorite Flies'';;
