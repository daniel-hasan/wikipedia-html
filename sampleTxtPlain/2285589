''I Believe'' is the English language debut album by Tata Young in 2004. This album is a big hit throughout Asia. The song, &quot;I Believe&quot;, topped the charts in Hong Kong, was a major success in Southeast Asia, and was a top-20 hit throughout the rest of East Asia. &quot;Sexy, Naughty, Bitchy&quot; broke the top 10 on the Oricon charts in Japan and was one of the most successful Asian singles of the year; like many of Tata's other singles, &quot;Sexy, Naughty, Bitchy&quot; dominated the airwaves in Southeast Asia.

So far the album has sold 1.2 million copies throughout the world. The album has not been widely sold in the U.S. due to the fact that the American music business is relatively difficult to break into, especially for a foreign artist.
