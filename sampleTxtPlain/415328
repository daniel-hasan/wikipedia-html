''Ctrl+Alt+Del'' (CAD) is a gaming-related webcomic and animated series written by Tim Buckley, known online as Absath. The name of the comic refers to computing's most common three-finger salute (computing)|three-finger salute, which on Windows systems is Control-Alt-Delete. The comic was originally going to be named 'Overclocked', but there was already, at the time, a webcomic with that specific name. After finding this, Buckley decided on the name Ctrl+Alt+Del. It premiered on October 23 2002, and is currently updated every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. The strip started off with a pair of gamers, Ethan and Lucas, as the main characters, but Lilah, a female gamer, has become a regular as well since she began dating Ethan (they are now engaged). Other characters include a Linux user, Scott and his pet penguin Ted, and an Xbox-based robot originally just named &quot;The Xbot&quot; but eventually renamed Zeke. Most of the humor in the comic concerns video games, but some is also bred of violence, with more still coming from the strip's randomness.;[http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php?d=20061028 &quot;Civil Servant&quot;]; As it has progressed, the comic has focused a lot more on long story arcs, which serve to add a sense of continuity and introduce new plot elements, instead of smaller one-comic gags (which still appear regularly, but generally aren't related to the main characters). By 2003, ''Ctrl+Alt+Del'' had become successful enough for creator Tim Buckley to live exclusively off of the strip's profits.;[http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3145208 Will Strip for Games], 1UP.com;

There are several running gags, the most notable concerning arrows. In several early strips Ethan is killed (or at least gravely injured) by arrows shot from out of frame,;[http://ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php?d=20021103 &quot;What The?!&quot;];;[http://ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php?d=20021110 &quot;Damn Strays&quot;]; an homage to a gag from ''The Kentucky Fried Movie'' according to commentary from Buckley in the first CAD book. Another strip shows Ethan as he is catching the arrow, and having an elephant fall on him.;[http://www.cad-comic.com/comic.php?d=20040712 &quot;The Swift&quot;]; The February 28 2003 strip turned the tables,;[http://ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php?d=20030228 &quot;Revenge... Best Served Cold&quot;]; with Ethan shooting an arrow at and killing Buckley, who was present in the comic to discuss the fact that he had drawn 100 Ctrl+Alt+Del strips. In addition to these, if one is to look at the bottom of the page, near the copyright information, there is a message that reads: &quot;By reading this fine print your soul is now the exclusive property of Ctrl+Alt+Del and subsidiaries. Unauthorized use of Ctrl+Alt+Del characters, images, materials, souls, odors, and oxygen is strongly discouraged. We know where you sleep.&quot; There are also several story arcs that center around Ethan sneaking into a game company's headquarters to steal a copy of a game before its public release.

Ctrl+Alt+Del also features a self-created post-New Year's holiday dubbed &quot;Winter-een-mas&quot;. Buckley has detailed the holiday: the season lasts all of January, much like the Christmas season, but the actual holiday itself is January 25 to January 31. It was created as a holiday for all things concerning gamers or gaming. Little is told about its traditions, however there are several spirits which represent the different genres of gaming (such as fighting or real-time strategy) who fly around the world on Winter-een-mas Eve in a giant ethereal gamepad.;[http://ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php?d=20040131 &quot;A Winter-een-mas Story, Page 7&quot;]; Every year at Winter-een-mas, Ethan has donned a crown and proclaimed himself king.

Main Characters

Ethan is also the king and creator of the gamers holiday that is known as 'Winter-een-mas' and creator of the Church of Gaming; see below for more information.

=Lucas Davidowicz ''(2002-present)''=
At 26 years of age, Lucas is more level-headed and down to earth than Ethan. He is something of a slacker, prepared to enjoy a good video game over actual work. Cynical and sarcastic, Lucas is a programmer, and has worked Customer Service at two computer stores.
;;

=Lilah Monroe ''(2003-present)''=
Smart and attractive, Lilah smashed Ethan's preconception that girls (or at least, cute ones) don't play video games, after which they began dating. Lilah is 25 and formerly worked as a secretary.
;;

=Scott ''(2002-present)''=
A 25-year-old Linux user and supposed web designer.;[http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php?d=20021203 &quot;My Thoughts Exactly&quot;]; He has a pet penguin named Ted, which is, appropriately, a reference to the Linux mascot, Tux.
;;

=Zeke ''(2003-present)''=
Zeke (short for Ezekiel, which was the name Ethan found &quot;spray painted on his ass&quot;), formerly known as the &quot;Xbot&quot;, is a List of fictional robots and androids#Web Comics|creation of Ethan's - a sentient, anthropomorphic Xbox/Xbox 360 hybrid console. He walks, talks, thinks, plays video games, had a strange crush on Ethan's GameCube, which he wants Ethan to turn into a female robot, and was shown in more than one comic &quot;eating&quot; bandwidth.

CAD Radio
CADRadio was a SHOUTcast based internet radio station, at one time the official radio station of the Ctrl+Alt+Del webcomic by Tim Buckley. It was started by Insomniac and Aliendragon, two of the CAD forum members. Originally started on a simple rented SHOUTcast server that provided 8 concurrent listener slots at 24 kbit/s mp3. Starting off relatively unpopular, it soon gathered quite a following and soon the 8 person server was no longer adequate and a series of relay servers were set up by listeners who volunteered to help. An integral part of the CADRadio shows was the IRC channel, originally found on XNet Then moved to its own IRC network owned and maintained by forum administrator Sidnaceous. This was the main hub of operations for CADRadio, and a meeting place for listeners, both at times when shows were being broadcast and when the station was off-air.

After a period of success, Tim gave the station &quot;official&quot; status, and even appeared on a show hosted by DJ FIRE|STARTER in the form of a phone interview.

Creative differences and personal disagreements caused problems within the management of CADRadio as time went on though, and led to the resignation of Insomniac and, at a later date, Aliendragon.

The station was taken over by FalconX and MZXGiant, but eventually abandoned.

CAD Premium
In late 2005, CAD Premium was announced. For a monthly or yearly fee, fans are able to access exclusive &quot;members only&quot; content, such as wallpapers and strips, as well as the flagship of CAD Premium; ''Ctrl+Alt+Del: The Animated Series'', which made its debut on February 2006.

While CAD Premium will be a subscription-based service, Buckley has made it clear that the comic will remain free, and that although the episodes have come to DVD, they are being offered at a discount to subscribers.

See ''List of Ctrl+Alt+Del: The Animated Series episodes''

Episodes are released at the beginning of each month.
All 12 Episode from the first season have been released.
Among the extras on the DVD release is Tim answering the question he gets asked the most (i.e. where the inspiration for Chef Brian came from). There are numerous instances of him answering this question, believing, &quot;If I put this out there for everyone, maybe it won't get asked quite as often&quot;.
