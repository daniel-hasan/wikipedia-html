Paramore (pronounced &quot;Par-a-mour&quot; ()) is a Grammy-nominated American pop rock;; band that formed in Franklin, Tennessee in 2004. After several lineup changes, Paramore now primarily consists of Hayley Williams (lead vocals/keyboard), Josh Farro (lead guitar/backing vocals), Jeremy Davis (bass), and Zac Farro (drums).

Influenced by the likes of Jimmy Eat World and Sunny Day Real Estate,;; frontwoman Hayley Williams and lead guitarist Josh Farro are the group's primary songwriters. In 2005, the group released their debut album ''All We Know Is Falling'', gaining a fanbase through touring and internet promotion of the singles &quot;Pressure&quot; and &quot;Emergency&quot;. By 2007, the band gained mainstream notoriety with their second album ''Riot!''. The first single, &quot;Misery Business&quot;, has received wide radio airplay and allowed for MTV to feature the band in Artist of the Week segments during August 2007. With their early success, much attention is paid to the young age of the band members; their ages range from 17 to 22.;;

History and Early Years
=Formation and ''All We Know Is Falling'' (2002-2005)=
At the age of 13, vocalist Hayley Williams moved from her hometown Meridian, Mississippi to Franklin, Tennessee where she met brothers Josh and Zac Farro.;; Shortly after arriving, she began taking vocal lessons with Brett Manning.;; Prior to forming Paramore, however, members of the group took part in a funk cover band.;; The other members of what was soon to be Paramore had been &quot;edgy about the whole female thing&quot; of having Williams as vocalist, but, because they were really good friends, she started writing for them and it eventually worked out.;The band was officially formed by Josh Farro (lead guitar/backing vocals), Zac Farro (drums), Jeremy Davis (bass) and Hayley Williams (lead vocals) in 2004,;; with the later addition of Jason Bynum (Rhythm Guitar). They took the name Paramore, which is derived the maiden name of one of the group's former bassists during the time in which they were &quot;still playing in the garage&quot;;;; once the group learned the meaning of the identically-sounding word ''paramour'' (&quot;secret lover&quot;), they decided to adopt the name, using the ''Paramore'' spelling.;; The band's first song written together was &quot;Conspiracy&quot;, which was later used on their debut album.;;

Over the following years, Paramore performed at venues outside the greater Nashville area, including the concert festivals Purple Door and Warped Tour. John Janick, CEO and co-founder of the music label Fueled by Ramen, got ahold of Paramore's demos and went to a Taste of Chaos performance in Orlando, Florida to see the band perform live. After a smaller private performance at a warehouse, the band was signed to the label in April 2005.;;

Paramore traveled back to Orlando to record their debut album ''All We Know Is Falling'', but, shortly after arriving, Davis opted to leave the band citing personal reasons. The remaining four members of Paramore continued with the album, writing &quot;All We Know&quot; about his departure, and later deciding to base ''All We Know Is Falling'' around the concept. The album artwork also reflected Paramore's grief as Williams explains, &quot;The couch [on the cover of ''All We Know is Falling''] with no one there and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space.&quot;; Recording for ''All We Know is Falling'' had taken three weeks, and promotional material for the album had only featured the four of the remaining members. Before touring, the band added John Hembree (bass) to their line up.;; After being asked by the band, Davis returned to Paramore, after five months apart, as Hembree left.;; ''All We Know Is Falling'' was released on July 24, 2005 and reached #30 on the Billboard's Heatseekers Chart. Paramore released &quot;Pressure&quot; as its first single, with a video directed by Shane Drake, but the song had failed to place on the charts. The video featured the band performing in a warehouse, eventually getting sprayed with water sprinklers as the storyline of a conflicted couple occurs. &quot;Pressure&quot; is also featured on the soundtrack to the EA Games video game ''The Sims 2'' for the Playstation 2. In July, &quot;Emergency&quot; was released as the second single, the video again reuniting the band with director Shane Drake and featuring Hunter Lamb, who replaced Bynum on guitar.; The video for &quot;Emergency&quot; showcased Paramore in another performance, this time fixing the members bloody and in worn costumes. The third single &quot;All We Know&quot;, was released with limited airtime, and the video consisting of a collection of live performances and backstage footage. During that summer, Paramore was featured on the Shira Girl Stage of the 2005 Warped Tour.;

=''Riot!'' (2006-Present)=
In January of 2006 they were a part of the Winter Go West Tour where they played alongside Seattle bands Amber Pacific and The Lashes, and in February, Williams' vocals were featured on &quot;Keep Dreaming Upside Down&quot; by October Fall.;; In the spring 2006, Paramore was an opening act on headlining tours for both Bayside and soon afterwards, The Rocket Summer. They toured the United Kingdom from October 5 to October 15, 2006, where they ended in London at The Mean Fiddler. The band then covered Foo Fighters' &quot;My Hero&quot; for the ''Sound of Superman'' soundtrack which was released on June 26, 2006.;;During the summer of 2006, Paramore played a portion of Warped Tour, primarily on the Volcom and Hurley Stages, and their first night on the Main Stage was at a date in their hometown of Nashville. Paramore's first United States headlining tour began on August 2, 2006 to a sold-out audience; with support from This Providence, Cute Is What We Aim For, and Hit the Lights with the final show in Nashville. That year they were voted &quot;Best New Band&quot;, and Williams as #2 &quot;Sexiest Female&quot;, by readers of the British magazine ''Kerrang!''.;;

In 2007, Paramore was named by Britishmagazine ''NME'' as one of ten bands to watch out for in their &quot;New Noise 2007&quot; feature.; In January, the band played an acoustic set for the grand opening of a Warped Tour exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,;; and the dress Williams wore in the video for &quot;Emergency&quot; was also put onto display in the exhibit.;; Paramore was featured in ''Kerrang!'' magazine once more, however, Williams believed the article was an untrue portrayal of the band, particularly because it focused on her as the main component. Afterwards, Williams addressed the issue in the band's LiveJournal, with a post saying, &quot;we could’ve done without a cover piece. sorry, if it offends anyone at kerrang! but i don’t think there was one bit of truth in that article.&quot;;; In April, Williams' vocals were featured in &quot;Then Came To Kill&quot; by The Chariot.;; They headlined a tour in early 2007 with This Providence, The Almost and Love Arcade.

Paramore began recording their second album ''Riot!'' in January 2007, ending production in March, without the guitar of Hunter Lamb (who left the band early in 2007 to get married);; without Lamb, lead guitarist Farro was required to play both guitar parts on the album.;; Lamb has since been replaced by guitarist Taylor York as temporary member for the duration of touring.;; After being courted by producers Neal Avron and Howard Benson,; Paramore opted to record ''Riot!'' with New Jersey producer David Bendeth, releasing the album on June 12, 2007. ''Riot!'' entered the Billboard 200 at number 20, the UK charts at number 24, and sold 44,000 its first week in the United States.; The name ''Riot!'' had been chosen because it meant &quot;a sudden outburst of uncontrolled emotion&quot;, and it was a word that &quot;summed it all up&quot;.; The first single off of the album, released June 21, 2007, &quot;Misery Business&quot;, is, according to Williams, &quot;more honest than anything I've ever written, and the guys matched that emotion musically.&quot; The origin of the song is ambiguous and Williams has given conflicting explainations. The Fueled By Ramen website reports that Williams wrote the song based on feedback the band revieved after a question she posted on their live journal asking what people were ashamed of.; However on the band's live journal Williams claims the song was written about a past experience involving a male friend who she felt was being manipulated by a girl, and later on when Williams and her friend began to date, she penned the lyrics to &quot;finally explain my side of the story and feel freed of it all&quot;.;; Later, Williams addressed the lyrics in the chorus: 



Williams felt that some might find the use of God &quot;casually. in vain, to be blunt&quot; as blasphemy, and as a Christian, she doesn't want &quot;to be held responsible for causing a lot of people to use my God's name in vain.&quot;; She posted an explanation and apology on the band's LiveJournal.
Paramore's video for the song featured the band performing in a room with the words 'Riot!' covering all surfaces, all intertwined with the storyline of a superficial girl who acts cruelly to other students before being confronted by Williams. &quot;Misery Business&quot; was the third Paramore video to be directed by Shane Drake, and was nominated for the &quot;Best Video&quot; award at the Kerrang! Awards 2007, but lost to Fall Out Boy's &quot;This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race&quot;.;; &quot;Misery Business&quot; is also featured on the soundtrack to the EA Sports video game ''NHL series#NHL 08|NHL 08''.

Lead vocalist Hayley Williams (front) and temporary guitarist Taylor York (right) perform at the Vans Warped Tour in Vancouver, July 2007. Summer of 2007 saw Paramore participating on their third Warped Tour and posting journals of their experiences on [http://yourhereblog.mtv.com/?s=paramore. yourhereblog for MTV]. In June they were declared by Rolling Stone as &quot;Ones to Watch&quot;.;; Paramore made their 1st Live Television debut on Fuse Networks daily show, The Sauce The second single off of ''Riot!'', &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, was released on July 30, 2007, and is currently only available online and on UK television. The video, much like &quot;All We Know&quot;, features backstage footage and live performances. In August 2007, Paramore had been featured in television spots on MTV, performing acoustic versions of their songs or acting in short accompaniments to MTV program commercials. As &quot;MTV Artists of the Week&quot;, the band filmed the faux camping themed spots in Queens, New York, all written and directed by Evan Silver and Gina Fortunato.;; Mtv.com also has a collection of [http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?id=1566472&amp;vid=165783 short videos] with the band to promote ''Riot'' as well. For weeks in August 2007, the &quot;Misery Business&quot; video was the number one streamed video at MTV.com.;; On October 8, Paramore played &quot;Misery Business&quot; live on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', a booking made possible due to the friendship struck between the band and Max Weinberg during the 2007 Warped Tour.;; In August,Paramore participated in the band New Found Glory's music video for their cover of Sixpence None the Richer's song &quot;Kiss Me&quot;. 

;
On October 11th, 2007, the music video for &quot;Crushcrushcrush&quot; debuted on the United States television as the next single off of ''Riot!''. The video for &quot;CrushCrushCrush&quot; featured the band playing a performance in a barren desert, being spied upon, and later destroying their equipment. The single was officially released in the United States on November 19 and made available in the United Kingdom on November 12, 2007.;; Williams recorded guest vocals for the tracks &quot;Church Channel&quot; and &quot;Plea&quot; for the Say Anything concept album ''In Defense of the Genre'' released on October 23, 2007.;; The group performed [http://thephoenix.com/onthedownload/PermaLink.aspx?guid=f4cbeb36-129a-451e-9618-835f6e442ae8 live], acoustic style in Boston on November 29, 2007 for FNX radio. On December 31, 2007, Paramore performed on the MTV New Years Eve program which ran from 11:30PM to 1:00AM. 

Paramore was featured on the cover of February 2008 issue of ''Alternative Press'' magazine and voted &quot;Best Band Of 2007&quot; by the readers.;; The band has also been nominated for &quot;50th Grammy Awards#Best New Artist|Best New Artist&quot; at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards presented on February 10, 2008.;; 2008 will see Paramore touring the United Kingdom, supporting their album ''Riot!'', along with New Found Glory.;; In early February 2008, the band will be touring in Europe.;; 

Musical style and influences
The majority of Paramore's recordings come from collaborations between lead vocalist Hayley Williams and lead guitarist Josh Farro &amp;mdash; Farro first writes the music, afterwords taking it to Williams for a melody and lyrics, and from that point the song worked out between the two.; Once the foundation is laid out, the remaining band members help to work on sound and arrangement. The duo's songwriting has been called &quot;contrastly cliched and weak at points&quot;;;, while others have said the songs are &quot;ridiculously catchy&quot; and &quot;sing-a-long worthy&quot;.;; Williams' vocals have often been cited as &quot;completely top notch&quot; enough to accompany those lyrics; the same has been said of Farro's guitar.;;; 

Joshua Martin had written after an interview with Williams, &quot;The band isn't just a short pop-punk girl with red hair and a spunky attitude. Their music is like them, it's aged differently. It's sped up, and slowed down. It's emo without being whiney, or bratty. Almost a very literal anti-Avril Lavigne.&quot;; ''Alternative Press'' magazine had commented that the band was &quot;young sounding&quot;, yet &quot;honest&quot;.;; Paramore's first album ''All We Know is Falling'' had an arguably more &quot;formulaic pop-punk&quot; sound that was &quot;delivered particularly well&quot;;; and the combination of the two had created a &quot;refined rock infused pop/punk album.&quot;;; The band's second release, ''Riot!'' was said to explore a 'diverse range of styles,&quot; however, not straying far from &quot;their signature sound.&quot;;

''Alternative Press'' and various other reviewers have noted that the band's stage performances have helped boost them to larger fame. ''Alternative Press'' states that Williams &quot;has more charisma than singers twice her age, and her band aren't far behind in their chops, either.&quot;;; Singer-songwriter John Mayer had praised William's voice in a blog in October 2007, calling her &quot;The great orange hope&quot;; &quot;orange&quot; in reference to her hair color.;; Because of the female fronted aspect of the band, Paramore has gained comparisons to Kelly Clarkson and the afore mentioned Avril Lavigne, to which one reviewer said was &quot;sorely unfounded.&quot;;;;; Reviewer Jonathan Bradley noted that &quot;Paramore attacks its music with infectious enthusiasm,&quot; however, he also explained that &quot;there isn’t a whole lot of difference between ''Riot!'' and the better songs from Kelly Clarkson or Avril Lavigne.&quot;;;A reviewer at ''NME'' had likened Paramore's sound to that of &quot;No Doubt (stripped of all the ska bollocks)&quot; and &quot;Kelly Clarkson's wildest dreams&quot;.;; Williams has gone on to comment about the female aspect of the band saying that Paramore isn't &quot;this girl-fronted band&quot; and it makes &quot;music for people to enjoy music, not so people can talk about my sexuality.&quot;;;

Although they believe themselves to be considered a pop music band by others, they were influenced by various rock music artists. Paramore has expressed their influence for creating the band and their music had come from appreciation for Jimmy Eat World, Chicago, Sunny Day Real Estate;, Death Cab for Cutie and Failure; Williams citing her personal influences as Robert Smith of The Cure and Etta James.;; Williams explained that bands such as U2, &quot;who are massive, and do whatever they want, write whatever they want and they stand for something&quot;, Jimmy Eat World, &quot;who I don’t think ever disappoint their fans,&quot; and No Doubt, who &quot;have done amazing things,&quot; act as a pattern for the path in which Paramore would like to take their career.;
