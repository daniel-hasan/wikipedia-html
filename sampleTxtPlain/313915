Herzliya (in ) is a city of approximately 83,000 located on Israel's central coastal strip, just north of Tel Aviv. It is part of the Tel Aviv District. Named after Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, Herzliya covers an area of 26 km². Within its municipal boundaries is Herzliya Pituah, one of Israel's most upscale neighborhoods, home to many ambassadors and foreign diplomats.

History
Founded in 1924 by seven pioneering families on land close to the site of the ancient Crusader city of Arsuf, Herzliya is named after Theodor Herzl, the father of modern Zionism. Herzliya's flag features seven stars to salute Herzl's idea of the seven-hour working day, as well as a small boat, two packs of wheat and a ship's wheel. Herzliya was officially recognized as a city in 1960.

The Herzliya Marina was built in the 1970s. The city also has a small airport (code: HRZ), three malls (Arena Mall, Shiv'at HaKokhavim Mall and the Outlet), movie theaters, museums, cultural centers and a stadium. It is home to Israel's largest film studio, Ulpanei Herzliya (Herzliya's Studios).

The Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center is a prestigious and renowned private college that offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in government, business administration, law, computer science and other academic disciplines. 

On the northern coast is a national park built around the ruins of Apollonia (Arsuf).
