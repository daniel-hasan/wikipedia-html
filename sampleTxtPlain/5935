The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the LDS Church or the Mormon Church, is the largest and most well-known denomination originating from the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith, Jr. The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and has established congregations and temples worldwide, reporting approximately 13 million members on its rolls.;&quot;LDS Church says membership now 13 million worldwide&quot;, ''Salt Lake Tribune'', June 25, 2007.;;Press Release, LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=80fc110c00c53110VgnVCM100000176f620aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=9ae411154963d010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD &quot;One Million Missionaries, Thirteen Million Members&quot;], 25 June 2007.;

Adherents, usually referred to as ''Latter-day Saints'', ''LDS'', or ''Mormons'', consider themselves to be Christians, but do not consider themselves part of the Catholic, Orthodox or Protestant traditions. The church may be considered a Restorationist organization, because it teaches there was a Great Apostasy, or loss of the original authority to lead Christ's church. Jesus is viewed as the head of the church, leading it today through revelations given to a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. The highest-ranking leader is the President of the Church, who is considered to be a prophet and an apostle.

Latter-day Saints believe that four books of &quot;scripture&quot; have divine authority; the Bible &quot;as far as it is translated correctly&quot;;See Article of Faith number 8.;, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. According to their canon, Jesus is the son of God and Mary, a virgin. They believe Jesus lived a sinless life, and that his suffering and crucifixion was an atonement for the sins of all humanity. They believe in Jesus' literal bodily resurrection, and that he currently sits at the right hand of God the Father. They believe Jesus is united in purpose with the Father, but that they both have separate bodies of &quot;flesh and bone,&quot; rather than solely spirit.

The church has also distinguished itself from other Christian denominations by their belief in modern-day revelation through a prophet, temple ceremonies (such as baptism for the dead, eternal marriage which continues into the after-life and the Endowment), that Jesus visited and preached in the Americas after his resurrection, and its former practice of plural marriage.;See . The church has since abandoned the practice of plural marriage.;

History



The LDS Church is the largest of the denominations from the Latter Day Saint movement that claim to be a continuation of the Church of Christ, founded by Joseph Smith, Jr. on April 6 1830 in New York.;;The majority of witnesses say the church was organized April 6 1830 in the log home of Joseph Smith, Sr. in the Manchester area, followed by a meeting the next Sunday in nearby Fayette at the home of Peter Whitmer, Sr. Nevertheless, one of Smith's histories and a later reminiscence by David Whitmer say the church was organized at the Whitmer home in Fayette. See Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints). The church refers to Fayette as the place of organization in all its official publications.;Joseph Smith legally established this early church soon after, he claimed, translating the Book of Mormon. The church rapidly gained a large following of individuals that viewed Joseph Smith as their prophet. The growth of Joseph Smith's following was attributed to the convincing power of the Book of Mormon, which Joseph Smith said he translated from a book of golden plates that were buried near his home in a place shown to him by a resurrected human named Moroni,;[http://lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=69f9307e3584b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 Joseph Smith's Testimony];, whom the LDS church commonly refers to as &quot;the angel Moroni&quot;;: &quot;On September 22, 1827, an angel named Moroni—the last Book of Mormon prophet—delivered these records to the Prophet Joseph Smith.&quot;;;;

In late 1830, Smith envisioned a &quot;city of Zion&quot; in Native American lands near Independence, Missouri. In October 1830, he sent his second-in-command, Oliver Cowdery, and others on a mission to the area.;; Passing through Kirtland, Ohio, the missionaries converted a congregation of Disciples of Christ led by Sidney Rigdon, and in 1831, Smith decided to temporarily move his followers to Kirtland until the Missouri area could be colonized. The church headquarters remained in Kirtland from 1831 to 1838; meanwhile, the church built its first temple and continued to grow.

On July 20 1831, Smith circulated a written revelation that Independence, Missouri was to be the center place for the city of Zion.;; Though many of Smith's followers attempted to colonize Missouri throughout the 1830s and Smith himself moved there in 1838, the church faced political and military opposition from other Missouri settlers. After a series of raids on Mormon settlements, the church formed its own militia to defend its members and the Mormon War of 1838 ensued, culminating in the religion being expelled from the state under an Extermination Order signed by Lilburn W. Boggs|the governor of Missouri.

The church then established its new headquarters in Nauvoo, Illinois, a city they built on drained swampland by the Mississippi River, where Smith served as mayor. There, the church built a new temple, and thrived until Smith and his brother Hyrum, who was serving as assistant president and patriarch of the church, were death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|killed by a mob in 1844. The Smith brothers were awaiting trial after the Nauvoo city council decided to destroy a local newspaper that accused Smith of practicing a form of polygamy and intending to establish himself as a theocratic king. Specific threats against the leadership of the church and violent action against its members were also made. While the legality of destroying a printing press that published violent threats against a community in 1844 is even today uncertain,;For a discussion, see Dallin H. Oaks. &quot;The Suppression of the Nauvoo Expositor.&quot; ''Utah Law Review'' 9 (Winter 1965):862–903. Oaks was not an LDS Apostle when he wrote this opinion.; Hyrum and Joseph were nevertheless promptly charged with disruption of the peace and high treason. Joseph Smith, at the time, was a minor candidate for President of the United States, with Sidney Rigdon as his running mate.

The Salt Lake Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the largest attraction in the city's Temple Square.

After the murder of the Smiths, a succession crisis ensued whereby a number of church leaders campaigned to lead the church. The majority of adherents voted to accept the succession claims presented by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, led by Brigham Young. Their claim was based on a March 1844 meeting wherein Joseph committed the &quot;keys of the kingdom&quot; on the twelve apostles with Young as their leader. After continued difficulties and persecution in Illinois, Young left Nauvoo in 1846 and led his followers to what later became the state of Utah (then part of Mexico), and began to colonize the area with numerous communities.

Young incorporated The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a legal entity under the laws of the Territory of Utah. He initially governed his followers as a theocratic leader serving in both political and religious positions. He openly encouraged the practice of plural marriage. When this practice became known in Washington, D.C., the United States sent federal troops there in 1857, deposed Young, and replaced him with a non-Mormon territorial governor, though Young still wielded significant political power as President of the Church.

Young was followed by other powerful leaders, who defiantly followed the dictates of their personal beliefs in the face of U.S. efforts to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages. Political and legal wrangling over the polygamy issue escalated until 1890, when church president Wilford Woodruff issued a Manifesto that officially suspended the practice.;; Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, and especially after 1904, when church president Joseph F. Smith disavowed polygamy before the United States Congress and issued a &quot;Second Manifesto&quot; calling for all polygamous marriages in the church to cease. Although both these statements were issued it has been estimated that 150 polygamous marriages had been done by the church per year from 1890 to 1904, many of which were performed in Mexico to alleviate the legal issues associated with conducting polygamous marriages in the United States.;D. Michael Quinn, &quot;LDS Church Authority and New Plural Marriages, 1890 - 1904&quot;; Since this time, the church has adopted a policy of excommunicating its members found practicing polygamy. In 1998, President Gordon B. Hinckley stated, ;
&quot;If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church.&quot;;[http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=7c86605ff590c010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 Gordon B.

During the twentieth century, the church experienced a period of strong growth resulting from both a high birth rate and extensive proselytism. 

The church has played, at times, a prominent role in political matters, including opposition to LGM-118A Peacekeeper|MX Peacekeeper missile bases in Utah and Nevada,;“[http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=b0d6fc3157a6b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 First Presidency Statement on Basing of MX Missile]”, ''Ensign'', June 1981, 76.; opposing the Equal Rights Amendment,;[http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=f8a4615b01a6b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 “The Church and the Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: A Moral Issue”], ''Ensign'', March 1980, insert.; opposing legalized gambling,;[http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=4ace94bf3938b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 “Church’s Stand against Gambling]”, ''Ensign'', March 1992, 74.; support of bans on same-sex marriage,;; and opposition to legalized physician-assisted death.;; Apart from issues that it considers to be ones of morality, however, the church maintains a position of political neutrality.;; see also Newsroom.lds.org, [http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=37ba9f4d1e031110VgnVCM100000176f620aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=f5f411154963d010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD &quot;No Thumbs Up or Down To Legislature&quot;], Retrieved May 2007.;

Beliefs and practices
Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have many beliefs in common with Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant traditions, but also some significant differences exist. Some of the church's core beliefs, circa 1842, are discussed in ''Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)''. A comparison between LDS Church doctrine and traditional Christian faiths are discussed in ''Mormonism and Christianity''. There are also numerous articles discussing Latter Day Saint movement perspectives on various doctrinal issues, which discuss the specific doctrines of the LDS Church as part of that movement. A summary of the church's major distinctive beliefs and practices are discussed below.

=God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost=


Latter-day Saints believe in the resurrected Jesus Christ, as depicted in the Christus Statue in the North Visitors' Center on Temple Square in Salt Lake City 

The church teaches that God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are &quot;one God&quot; in the sense that they are one &quot;in purpose&quot;, but does not accept the Nicene Creed's definition of Trinity, that the three are &quot;consubstantial&quot;. Rather, the church teaches that the Father and the Son are two distinct beings, both with glorified, perfect bodies of flesh and bone, while the Holy Ghost is a distinct being with only a &quot;spirit body&quot;.;; God the Father is understood to be the literal father of all the spirits who inhabit this earth;, ;.He is also understood to be the father of Jesus' spirit body and his physical body. Joseph Smith stated, ;
&quot;Many men say there is one God; the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost are only one God. I say that is a strange God [anyhow]--three in one and one in three. . .It is curious organization. . . All are crammed into one God according to sectarianism (Christian faith). It would make the biggest God in all the world. He would be a wonderfully big God--he would be a giant or a monster (monstrosity).&quot;;Joseph Smith, Teachings, 372;
;

The church teaches that Jesus is its central focus and emphasizes that his suffering in Gethsemane and on the cross paid for the sins of humanity. This Atonement however is also believed to cover not only sin, but pain, suffering, heart ache, or hardship we experience in our life on earth. Latter-day Saints believe that Jesus' status as the son of a mortal woman gave him the ability to suffer temptations and experience physical death; while his status as the Son of God gave him the power to lay down and take up his life again at will. The church also believes in the physical resurrection of Jesus' body: that his physical body and spirit body were reunited, never again to be separated. Because of its emphasis on Jesus' resurrection and his status as the living head of the church, the church does not officially use the symbol of the Christian cross. Instead, the church tends to focus on the belief that Jesus overcame suffering and death and that he lives today.

The church follows what it understands to be the teachings of Jesus, both in the Bible and in other scriptures, such as the Book of Mormon. The church also teaches that Jesus is the god Jehovah of the Old Testament. Because Jesus is thought to be omniscient and have the same purpose as the Father, the church teaches that Jesus Christ often speaks in the scriptures as though he were God the Father, because in so doing he is fulfilling the will of the Father.;;

Official church materials refer to &quot;Heavenly Parents,&quot; implying to some the existence of a Heavenly Mother.;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, [http://lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=f04a7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;hideNav=1&amp;contentLocale=0 &quot;Chapter 2: Our Heavenly Family&quot;], ''Gospel Principles'', 11 (1997).; Belief in such a figure is common among members, and she has been mentioned in sermons by church officials;See, e.g., Spencer W. Kimball, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=c3ead0640b96b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 &quot;The True Way of Life and Salvation&quot;], ''Ensign'', May 1978, 4.;;; and in some of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hymns|hymns of the church.;See, e.g., ''Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', #292 &quot;O My Father&quot;; #286 ''Oh, What Songs of the Heart''.; However, no specific doctrine on the subject of a Heavenly Mother has been released by the church.


=Apostasy, restoration, and priesthood=
Joseph Smith, Jr. said that he saw two &quot;personages&quot; in the spring of 1820, one of which pointed to the other and said, &quot;This is my beloved son. Hear him!&quot; The church teaches this was an actual visitation by God the Father and Jesus in the flesh.

In common with other Restorationist churches, the church believes in a Great Apostasy. It teaches that after the death of Jesus and the Twelve Apostles, the priesthood authority was lost and some important doctrinal teachings, including the text of the Bible, were changed from their original form, thus necessitating a Restoration prior to the Second Coming. That restoration, according to church doctrine, took place during the life of Joseph Smith, Jr.

According to church theology, the restoration took place through a series of visions and revelations, including Smith's First Vision in 1820, visits by various angelic messengers including Moroni, John the Baptist, Moses, Elijah, and the apostles Peter, James and John. Smith said these messengers gave him priesthood authority (first the Aaronic priesthood and then the Melchizedek priesthood) and various &quot;keys&quot; of the priesthood that had been lost through the ages, so that Smith finally possessed the &quot;fullness of the Gospel&quot;. The restoration also included the formation of the Church of Christ. The LDS Church teaches that it is the successor of this Church of Christ and that the current President of the Church is Smith's modern successor.

The priesthood authority is offered (people are free to choose not to receive the priesthood) to all male members ages 12 and older who generally follow the church's code of morality. Men receive the priesthood by ordination, which consists of other priesthood holders laying their hands on their head and also providing a blessing. After the time of Joseph Smith, black men of sub-Saharan African descent were barred from being ordained to the priesthood and entering the religion's temples; in 1978, church president Spencer W. Kimball announced a revelation declaring that all worthy men could be ordained to the priesthood. (See Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.) Women are not ordained to priesthood offices, although some temple ordinances are performed by women. (see Temple (Latter Day Saints), Endowment (Latter Day Saints) and Women and Mormonism.)

For the most part, ordination to the priesthood is a prerequisite to preside in the church, although women are given un-ordained leadership roles over children and other women, and they perform certain temple ordinances of women. The priesthood is structured in a hierarchical manner, emphasizing obedience. Members are encouraged to avoid public criticism of priesthood leaders; repeated public criticism by an individual may eventually result in excommunication. (See Mormonism and authority.) Although the church had a paid local clergy in the 1800s,;D. Michael Quinn (1997), ''Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power'', Salt Lake City: Signature Books, ch. 6.; local and regional priesthood leaders currently serve as volunteers. Non-clerical church employees, general authorities (who serve life or five-year terms), and mission presidents (who serve three-year terms) are paid a stipend from church funds and provided other benefits. A general missionary fund covers the basic living expenses of single Mormon missionaries. Missionaries and their families are asked to contribute to this fund, and in the United States the missionary's congregation of origin is ultimately responsible to satisfy the monthly obligation to the general fund. Members volunteer general custodial work for local church facilities.

=Ordinances, covenants and temples=

250 px|Baptismal font in the Salt Lake Temple, circa 1912, where baptisms for the dead are performed by proxy. The font rests on the backs of twelve oxen representing the Twelve Tribes of Israel 

Latter-day Saint sacraments are called ''ordinances'', and there are two types: saving ordinances and non-saving ordinances. All ordinances, whether saving or nonsaving, must be performed by a man ordained to the appropriate priesthood office, with the exception of certain parts of the Endowment and the initiatory or washings and anointings, in which women can perform the ordinance without being ordained to an office.

Saving ordinances are those required for salvation, and include baptism by immersion, with &quot;sacrament&quot;, taken each Sunday, to keep in remembrance of and to renew the covenant made at baptism, the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost (confirmation), ordination to an office of the priesthood (for males), the initiatory or washings and anointings, the Endowment, celestial marriage, and family sealings. Each saving ordinance is associated with one or more covenant that the person receiving the ordinance makes with God.;LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.3933737ad2ff28132eb22a86942826a0/?vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=13bb9daac5d98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____ &quot;Gospel Topics: Ordinances&quot;].;

The church teaches that to obtain the highest degree of salvation (referred to as &quot;exaltation&quot; in the celestial kingdom), all people who have lived to the age of eight must participate in each of the saving ordinances. However, the church teaches that they may be performed for a person either during their lifetime or by proxy after the person has died.;LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=0e0a7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;hideNav=1&amp;contentLocale=0 “Chapter 40: Temple Work and Family History”], ''Gospel Principles'', 255.; Therefore, church members participate in the saving ordinances on behalf of dead relatives and others whose names have been extracted from historical records. The performance of these proxy ordinances are one of the functions of the church's temples. There have been certain exceptions to the church's policy of performing proxy work for all persons who have died: prior to the 1978 revelation admitting blacks to temple ceremonies, the church did not perform proxy ordinances for black men and women who had died, and since 1995, the church has agreed to discontinue performing ordinances for dead victims of the Jewish Holocaust.;Associated Press Newswire, Richard Pyle, May 5, 1995; 

All the saving ordinances are currently open to all worthy members of the appropriate age. Prior to 1978, black members were barred from all saving ordinances other than baptism and confirmation, but this policy was changed in 1978.;See Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.; Celestial marriage is open to one man and one woman at a time, but a widower may enter a second celestial marriage.

Apart from sealings to parents, the church does not perform saving ordinances for those younger than age eight or for those who have died before the age of eight (when children reach the &quot;Coming of age#Age of accountability|age of accountability&quot;), because young children are deemed &quot;alive in Christ&quot; and not responsible for sin.;; ; LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=84aa7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;hideNav=1&amp;contentLocale=0 “Chapter 20: Baptism”], ''Gospel Principles'', 129.; Likewise, the church teaches that the saving ordinances are not required for persons age eight or older who are &quot;mentally incapable of knowing right and wrong&quot;.;LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=84aa7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;hideNav=1&amp;contentLocale=0 “Chapter 20: Baptism”], ''Gospel Principles'', 129.; 

Non-saving ordinances include the dedication of graves, the dedication of buildings, the Prayer circle#Prayer Circles in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|prayer circle, the Hosanna shout, shaking the dust from the feet, and various kinds of blessings, including the patriarchal blessing.

=Plan of salvation=


The plan of salvation, as taught by the church, describes humanity's place in the universe and the purpose of life. The church teaches that there was a pre-existence|pre-mortal existence, a place which existed prior to mortality in which all people and all life were created in spirit form.;; ;;Smith, Joseph Fielding. Bruce R. McKonkie, ed. ''Doctrines of Salvation'' (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954 [1972 reprint]) Vol. 1, p. 62;Central to this is the notion that humans existed as spirits before birth, were raised by Heavenly parents and had essential human characteristics such as gender.;FIrst Presidency and Council of the Twelve Apostles.&quot;The Family: A Proclamation to the World&quot; 1995;This general idea is also stated as &quot;We lived in the presence of God.&quot;;Smith. ''Doctrines of Salvation''. vol. 1, p. 56;;general idea also expressed in Smith, Joseph F. ''Gospel Doctrine: Sermons and Writtings of Joseph F. Smith''. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1969) p. 93;

During the pre-earth life, Heavely Father presented a plan to have a Savior make it possible for mankind to be saved.Jesus Christ stepped forward as the chosen Savior.However, Lucifer, one of the spirits, proposed a rival plan whereby every soul would be saved, he would receive God's power, and human agency would be eliminated.;See ;;Abrahma 3:24-28 describes this as well; When God rejected that plan, the War in Heaven ensued, resulting in Lucifer and one third part of the spirits being cast out and denied ever receiving physical bodies.Lucifer became the devil.;, 2 Nephi 2:17 briefly mentions the fall of Satan (Book of Mormon, p. 58 [1982 English edition (Salt Lake City)]).;

The earth, according to church teachings in the temples, was created by Jehovah, which the church identifies as the pre-mortal Jesus, and Michael the archangel, who is identified as the pre-mortal Adam. The earth was &quot;organized&quot; from pre-existing matter,;See ; as were other planets with their inhabitants.;; Michael's spirit was implanted in a body created by God the Father and Jehovah, and became Adam.

The church teaches that at birth, a pre-existing spirit enters a mortal body. Upon death, the spirit goes to a &quot;spirit world&quot; to await the resurrection of the dead. There, a preliminary judgment based on behavior on earth places the spirit in either a state of paradise or spirit prison. Those in &quot;prison&quot; will be visited by spirits from paradise and given the chance to learn of the teachings of Jesus Christ and to accept the accompanying saving ordinances.;LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=6d8b7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;hideNav=1&amp;contentLocale=0 “Chapter 45: The Postmortal Spirit World”], ''Gospel Principles'', 289.; The church teaches that all persons, wicked or righteous, will be resurrected and receive an immortal, physical body.;See .; The nature of that body, however, will depend on the result of the Last Judgment, at which Jesus will assign each soul to one of three degrees of glory (heavenly kingdoms): the celestial kingdom in the presence of the Father and the Son for those who accept Jesus Christ and receive all LDS saving ordinances, either as a mortal or by proxy; the terrestrial kingdom, a place of glory in the presence of Christ for righteous persons who refuse to receive the saving ordinances and for those who do not keep the covenants they commit to; and the telestial kingdom for the wicked. A further destination, called outer darkness, is reserved for Satan, his devils, and those mortals who commit the unpardonable sin and thereby become the sons of perdition.;LDS Church.

=View of history and eschatology=
The church's view of history is informed by the faith's scriptures. Mormon history begins with the creation according to Genesis, but has never endorsed any particular form of creationism. Though it does not officially oppose any particular findings of natural history, the church regards Adam as the first &quot;primal parent of the [human] race&quot;.;LDS Church (1909), First Presidency Statement: The Origin of Man.;

Based on teachings in the Book of Mormon, the church teaches an expansive form of American exceptionalism, where the Americas are a special location reserved by God for those who love freedom and freedom of religion. According to Joseph Smith, what is now Jackson County, Missouri was the location of the Garden of Eden and will be the location of the future New Jerusalem, and God has led numerous groups to the western hemisphere in search of freedom,;See ; including several groups of ancestors to the Native Americans whose stories are told in the ''Book of Mormon''.

The church also teaches an expansive view of God's covenant with Abraham, which Joseph Smith taught extends not just to Jews, but to Mormons, who in most cases are declared by their patriarchal blessings to be literal descendants of the tribe of Ephraim, or adopted into this tribe. Native Americans are typically declared to be descended from the Tribe of Manasseh based on the teachings of the ''Book of Mormon'' that members of this tribe, the family of Lehi, crossed the ocean on boats in about 600 B.C. and became their principal ancestors.

The church teaches that in the future the Second Coming of Jesus will occur, followed by a thousand years of peace, after which will occur the Last Judgment. Distinctive within Latter-day millennialism, however, is the idea that Jesus will reign &quot;personally upon the earth&quot; from a location that is presently within the United States;; and direct the government or governments that will exist.;Berrett, William E, Teachings of the Doctrine and Covenants, 1956, Ch. 42, p.280; Jackson County, Missouri is expected to have an important LDS temple during the Millennium and Jerusalem is expected to be an important center of government in the world.;Brewster, Hoyt W, Isaiah Plain and Simple: The Message of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon, 1995, Ch. 2, p.10-13; As the earth transitions into the Millennial period, only those good and honorable people who stand to inherit the celestial kingdom or the terrestrial kingdom will continue on the earth; the Latter-day Saints will continue to proselytize among the living and perform ordinances for the dead until a final great confrontation of good versus evil prior to the Last Judgment.

=Theology of family and gender=


An LDS couple preparing for a Celestial marriage
The LDS Church has been characterized as a family-centered religion. The church teaches that every being that lived upon the earth initially had a spirit body and that all were born to Heavenly Parents in a pre-existence|pre-mortal existence.; The church teaches that on earth, families may be &quot;sealed&quot;—meaning that they are eternally bound as husband–wife, parents–child—and that these bonds will continue after death.;LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=c2c97befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;hideNav=1&amp;contentLocale=0 “Chapter 38: Eternal Marriage”], ''Gospel Principles'', 241.; Sealings can also include deceased ancestors, providing much of the church's rationale for its extensive family history activities.

The church also teaches that each person's gender is eternal and that gender roles are authorized by God: in general, men are to preside over and provide for their families and women are to nurture children.;LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,161-1-11-1,00.html The Family: A Proclamation to the World].; The church characterizes the man-woman relationship as &quot;equal but different&quot;.;Sonja Farnsworth (1992), [http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/women/chapter13.htm#Priesthood &quot;Mormonism's Odd Couple: The Motherhood-Priesthood Connection&quot;], in Maxine Hanks, ed., ''Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism'', Salt Lake City: Signature Books.; Nevertheless, LDS women in the United States work outside the home in about the same percentage as other American women.;Helen Witney &amp; Jane Barnes (2007), [http://www.pbs.org/mormons/etc/script2.html ''The Mormons, Part 2''] (PBS presentation) (&quot;Mormon women work outside the home in about the same proportions as other American women&quot;).; The church teaches that gender is inherently linked to sex, but the church has no official policy on the status of intersex persons. Transgender persons are accepted in the church and may be baptized, but may not receive the priesthood or enter the temple if they are considering or have undergone elective sex reassignment surgery.;''Church Handbook of Instructions: Book 1, Stake Presidents and Bishoprics'' (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2006) at 41, 78.;

The status of women in church leadership has remained largely unchanged since the early 1900s. Although they are not ordained to the priesthood, preaching and instruction by women is an integral part of weekly Latter-day Saint worship. Certain leadership positions are filled only by women, and in some of the church's auxiliary organizations women may preside over men, such as in the Primary, in welfare programs, on activities committees, and at a Family History Library. Since the 1840s, women have officiated in certain ordinances that take place inside temples.;;

=Sexuality=

The church teaches what it calls the law of chastity, a moral code that its members must follow to be in good standing with the church. At its core, the law of chastity prohibits pre-marital sex and adultery,;LDS Church (1997), ''Gospel Principles'', p. 249.; which includes gay and lesbian sex. The law also prohibits other sexual behavior, such as bestiality and masturbation, as well as mental behavior such as lust, sexual fantasy, and viewing of pornography.;Spencer W. Kimball (1969), ''The Miracle of Forgiveness'', Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, pp. 25, 77–89.;

The church encourages members to enter a celestial marriage, the only form of marriage recognized by the church as a sacrament and &quot;the only due and proper way of joining husband and wife&quot;.;Heber J. Grant, J. Reuben Clark, Jr., David O. McKay (October 1942), [http://search.ldslibrary.com/article/view/191477#191673 &quot;Parenthood: First Presidency Message&quot;], ''Conference Report'', pp. 12-13.; For purposes of the law of chastity, however, the church presently recognizes only civil unions that are considered &quot;legal and lawful&quot; by the government where it takes place, with certain exceptions including same-sex marriage, polygamous marriage, common law marriage, and other types of non-ceremonial marriages in non-common law countries.;In the 19th century, the church performed illegal polygamous marriages, but that practice has been discontinued. The church is sensitive about its historical relationship with polygamy and entry into a polygamous marriage, even where legal, may result in excommunication: ''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'' (2006), p. 110.;

Where celestial marriage is not recognized by the government, it must be preceded by a civil marriage. The church's teachings are ambiguous about the scope of allowable sexual behavior between legally married couples.;Some church leaders have taught that oral sex, anal sex and contraception are sinful, even as part of a marriage relationship, but there are no policies on these issues that are enforced in the church. On January 5, 1982 the First Presidency issued a [http://www.lds-mormon.com/worthy_letter.shtml statement to church leaders] that stated that the First Presidency &quot;has interpreted oral sex to constitute an unnatural, impure, or unholy practice&quot;. However, the statement also counseled church leaders to &quot;scrupulously avoid&quot; detailed inquiries into the sexual practices of married couples and emphasized that married couples &quot;can determine by themselves&quot; what is appropriate in their sexual relationship.;The law of chastity has also been interpreted to include standards of modesty in dress and action.;

Gordon Hinckley: “Now we have gays in the church. Good people. We take no action against such people—provided they don’t become involved in transgression, sexual transgression. If they do, we do with them exactly what we’d do with heterosexuals who transgress.”) Nevertheless, according to the church handbook, repeated homosexual activities by adults, unlike repeated heterosexual extramarital sex, will result in an automatic annotation to a person's permanent membership record, which will follow them if they move to a new local congregation. ''See'' ''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'' (2006), p. 147. Also, homosexual activity committed after the age of 16 will normally permanently bar a person from serving a mission for the church. Id., p. 94.; If they do, they can “go forward as do all other members of the church.”; If they desire to enter into a heterosexual marriage, they should first learn to deal with their homosexual feelings; otherwise, they must remain celibate.;[http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=27f71f1dd189f010VgnVCM100000176f620aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=726511154963d010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD Interview with Elder Oaks and Wickman].; Gay or lesbian sex, in any form, whether the participants are married or not, may be grounds for excommunication.

= Organized worship and participation=

The church provides several kinds of services and gatherings for participation by members and non-members, including weekly services on Sunday, periodic conferences such as the semi-annual general conference, and ritual services at the church's temples (for members only). All persons, regardless of their beliefs or standing in or out of the church, are welcome to attend normal church services and conferences.;[http://www.mormon.org/question/worship/1,8578,797-1,00.html Open invitation to attend church, on Church-maintained website];Women usually attend worship services wearing skirts or dresses, while men typically wear suits or dress shirts (preferably white) and ties. Children are also typically in their &quot;Sunday best.&quot;;Mormon.org. ;

The church holds its normal Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|worship services on Sunday;Services may be held on a different day when Sunday worship is prohibited by law.; during a three-hour block composed of three meetings: sacrament meeting, which features the church's weekly sacrament (Eucharist) ritual and sermons by various selected members; Sunday School, featuring a lesson on various scriptural topics; and finally, each participant is assigned a meeting based on their age and sex, which could include a meeting of priesthood holders for males aged 12 and up separated into age-specific quorums, Relief Society for adult women, and a meeting of the Young Women Organization for adolescent females. During the second and third hours, children participate in activities of the Primary. Periodically, members participate in local, regional, and general church-wide conferences in lieu of Sunday services. The general conference is broadcast semi-annually from Salt Lake City, Utah.

The church also provides ritual services at its temples, which are open only to members of the appropriate age who meet standards of orthodoxy and worthiness. Members are encouraged to attend the temples regularly, where they usually participate in the Endowment, sealing, washing and anointing, and other ordinances, most often by proxy for the dead.

= Duties and expectations of church members=
 
 
Members of the church have a high degree of participation in religious activities outside of worship services. Members are expected or encouraged to pray frequently (several times a day), perform good works, and read scriptures daily.

Members are expected to donate their time, money, and talents to the church, and those who have participated in the Endowment ceremony make an oath to donate all that they have, if required of them, to the Lord.To be in good standing and to enter the church's temples, church members are required to tithe their income to the church, which is usually interpreted as 10% of income. In addition, members are expected to donate monthly charitable &quot;fast offerings&quot; (at least the equivalent cost of two meals), which are used to help the needy, regardless of whether or not they are church members, and are encouraged to make other humanitarian donations when necessary.

In addition to attending the weekly three-hour church services, members are usually given &quot;callings&quot; or assignments in the church, and often attend various other meetings or activities throughout the week relating to that calling. Members in good standing are assigned to visit the homes of other members monthly as &quot;home teachers&quot; (men) or &quot;visiting teachers&quot; (women). Members are also expected to engage in missionary work, family history research, to conduct a Family Home Evening weekly with their family, and to attend the temple regularly. Church members are encouraged to live self-sufficiently and avoid unnecessary debt.;; Benson, Ezra Taft. &quot;Pay Thy Debt, and Live.&quot; ''Ensign''. June 1987: p. 3. ; All male members are expected to serve a two-year mission at the age of 19, though there are high standards of worthiness and physical and mental health that prohibit many men from serving. Women may optionally serve a mission if they are over the age of 21 and not married, as may older married couples.

Good standing in the church requires that members follow the &quot;Word of Wisdom&quot;;Doctrine and Covenants section 89, originally a strong recommendation, but adopted as a requirement by Brigham Young in 1851.; (a health code given by Joseph Smith which the church interprets as requiring abstinence from alcoholic beverages, tobacco, coffee, black tea, and recreational drugs). Members must also obey the law of chastity (the church's code for modesty and allowable forms of sexuality), and may not obtain an elective abortion, except in the cases of a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, a pregnancy that seriously jeopardizes the life or health of the mother, or a pregnancy where a physician determines that the fetus has severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth.;''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1:Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'', 2006, p. 185.; In general, members must obey the law of the country in which they live and visit, although there have been notable exceptions.;For example, until 1890, the church advocated civil disobedience to U.S. anti-polygamy laws.; The church discourages gambling in all forms, including lotteries.;[http://www.lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,89-1-520-21,00.html Gambling]. Gordon B. Hinckley, ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''.;

Church members who commit what are considered serious violations of the standards of the church (defined as, without limitation, &quot;attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, spouse abuse, intentional serious physical injury of others, adultery, fornication, homosexual relations, deliberate abandonment of family responsibilities, robbery, burglary, theft, embezzlement, sale of illegal drugs, fraud, perjury, and false swearing&quot;;''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'' (2006), p. 110.;) may be subject to church disciplinary action, including disfellowshipment or even excommunication. Such individuals are encouraged to continue attending church services, but are not permitted to hold church responsibilities or offer public prayer at any church meeting (although personal prayer is encouraged); excommunicated members are also prohibited from paying tithing or fast offerings. Other members are frequently unaware of the status of such individuals.;; Everyone is welcome to attend the public meetings of the church, whether or not they adhere to the church's lifestyle code.

In contrast to overt actions which are prohibited, church members are generally permitted to think or believe freely on any issue, but are discouraged from publicly criticising local leaders or general authorities; repeated public criticism of the church or its leaders may subject a person to church discipline for apostasy. The church maintains a Strengthening Church Members Committee which monitors members' publications and refers critical material to local authorities for possible disciplinary action.

= Sacred texts and other publications=
The Standard Works of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints printed in the ''Quadruple Combination'' format



The church's canon of sacred texts consists of the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price. These are more commonly referred to as the church's Standard Works. Though not canonical, many members of the church also accept the teachings and pronouncements of the church's general authorities—and in particular those of the President of the Church—as scripture, and even as taking precedence over the Standard Works.;Ezra Taft Benson (1980-02-26), &quot;Fourteen Fundamentals of Following the Prophet&quot;, BYU Devotional (contending that &quot;the living prophet is more vital to us than the Standard Works&quot;).;

The church's most distinctive scripture, the Book of Mormon, was published by founder Joseph Smith, Jr. in 1830, and is believed to be a spiritual history of various groups of pre-Columbian Israelites. Smith stated that he translated the Book of Mormon from plates that had &quot;the appearance of gold&quot; that he found buried near his home. The introduction printed with the book says that it is a history of the principal ancestors of the &quot;American Indian&quot; peoples.;However, this introduction is not officially recognized by the church as being part of the divinely inspired canon of scripture.; Much debate has taken place on the subject of whether archaeology supports or denies the Book of Mormon's authenticity.

The church's acceptance of the Bible as the word of God comes with the provisional belief that it was not always translated correctly from the original manuscripts.;See(&quot;We believe the ''Bible'' to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.&quot;); Joseph Smith worked on his own translation, said to be more correct. An extract of his translation can be found in the Pearl of Great Price, called Joseph Smith-Matthew after the book of Abraham and preceding Joseph Smith-History. For English language speakers, the church encourages the use of the ''King James Version''.;.; The church regards parts of the Apocrypha,;See .; the writings of some Protestant Reformers and non-Christian religious leaders, and the non-religious writings of some philosophers to be inspired, though not canonical.;[http://ldsfaq.byu.edu/emmain.asp?number=202 FAQ about the Church];

The church's Doctrine and Covenants is a collection of modern revelations, declarations, and teachings, primarily written by Joseph Smith. The Pearl of Great Price contains Joseph Smith—History|an excerpt from Smith's 1838 autobiographical writings, two portions of his translation of the Bible, which are the books of Moses (the writer of the first five books of the Bible), the Book of Abraham (Smith's translation of an Egyptian papyrus, which also tells of the creation), Joseph Smith-Matthew, Joseph Smith-History, and an excerpt of one of Smith's 1842 letters describing church beliefs, now known as the Articles of Faith.

The church also publishes several official periodicals, including the ''Ensign'' (for English-speaking adults), the ''Liahona'' (non-English languages),;The ''Liahona'' is currently published in over 50 languages. Material for adults, youth, and children is included in each edition.; the ''New Era'' (for youth), and the ''Friend'' (for children). Some older, discontinued English-language publications produced or affiliated with the church included ''Evening and Morning Star'' (1833–1834), ''Messenger and Advocate'' (1834–1837), ''Elders' Journal'' (1837), ''Times and Seasons'' (1839–1846), ''Millennial Star'' (1840–1970), ''The Seer'' (1853–1854), ''Journal of Discourses'' (1854–1886), ''The Juvenile Instructor'' (1866–1930), ''Woman's Exponent'' (1872–1914), ''The Contributor'' (1879–1896), ''Young Woman's Journal'' (1889–1929), ''Improvement Era'' (1897–1970), ''The Children's Friend'' (1902–1970), ''Relief Society Magazine'' (1915–1970), and ''The Instructor'' (1930–1970).

Church organization and structure
= Name and legal entities=

The church teaches that it is a continuation of the Church of Christ established in 1830 by Joseph Smith, Jr. This original church underwent several name changes during the 1830s, being called the ''Church of Jesus Christ'', the ''Church of God'',;.; and then in 1834, the name was officially changed to the ''Church of the Latter Day Saints'';
.; to differentiate it from the 1st century Christian church. In April 1838, the name again was officially changed by revelation to the ''Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints'';
.; There were several alternate spellings of this name in use during Smith's lifetime, however, including a hyphenated &quot;Latter-Day&quot;. After Smith died, Brigham Young and the largest body of Smith's followers incorporated the LDS Church in 1851 by legislation of the State of Deseret,;The initial incorporation by the non-existent State of Deseret[http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/uthisstat&amp;CISOPTR=1756&amp;REC=4] was not legally valid, but was soon ratified by the Territory of Utah in 1851[http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Futhisstat&amp;CISOPTR=448&amp;REC=3&amp;CISOBOX=church+of+jesus+christ+of+latter-day+saints] and 1855. See ''Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Romney'', 136 U.S. 44&amp;ndash;45 (1890).; under the name ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', which included a hyphenated &quot;Latter-day&quot; and a lower-case &quot;d&quot;.;[http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/uthisstat&amp;CISOPTR=1756&amp;REC=4 State of Deseret: An Ordinance, incorporating the Church or Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, February 4, 1851.]; In 1887, the LDS Church was legally dissolved in the United States by the Edmunds-Tucker Act because of the church's practice (now abandoned) of polygamy. Thereafter, the church has continued to operate as an &quot;unincorporated religious association&quot;, under the name ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', which remains its formal name. Accepted informal names include the ''LDS Church'', the ''Latter-day Saints'', and the ''Mormons''. The term ''Mormon Church'' is in common use, but the church began discouraging its use in the late 20th century.;The LDS church requests that the official name, ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', be used where possible.[http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=ca07ae4af9c7e010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD]. It also encourages the use of &quot;the Church&quot; or &quot;the Church of Jesus Christ&quot; as shortened references, although &quot;LDS Church&quot; is commonly used within the church's own publications and the church officially uses &quot;Mormon&quot; as a descriptive term for itself in the name of the ''Mormon Tabernacle Choir'' and the website [http://beta.mormon.org ''mormon.org'']. Despite these efforts, the Associated Press continues to recommend &quot;Mormon Church&quot; as a proper second reference in its ''Style Guide'' for journalists, and the church itself uses &quot;Mormon Church&quot; on some of its websites.;
;

The church has organized several tax-exempt corporations to assist with the transfer of money and capital. These include the ''Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', organized in 1916 under the laws of the state of Utah to acquire, hold, and dispose of real property. In 1923, the church incorporated the ''Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'' in Utah to receive and manage money and church donations. In 1997, the church incorporated Intellectual Reserve, Inc. to hold all the church's copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property. The church also holds several non-tax-exempt corporations. See Finances of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

=Current membership=

The church reports a worldwide membership of 13 million;; with approximately 6.7 million residing outside the United States. According to these statistics it is the fourth largest religious body in the United States.;[http://www.electronicchurch.org ''2005 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches''], National Council of Churches. See article by [http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001481.html Information Please® Database], Pearson Education, Inc.; The church membership report includes all baptized members and also &quot;children of record&quot;—unbaptized children under the age of nine.

=Geographic structure=
Church congregations are generally organized geographically. For Sunday services, the church is grouped into either larger (~200 to ~400 people) congregations known as wards, or smaller congregations known as branches. These neighborhood congregations meet in meetinghouses, also referred to as &quot;chapels&quot; or &quot;stake centers&quot; or just ward buildings, located on property most often owned by the church. In some geographic areas, rental property may be used as a meetinghouse. Although the building may sometimes be referred to as a &quot;chapel&quot;, the room used as a chapel for religious services is actually only one component of the standard meetinghouse.;[http://www.mormon.org/virtualchapel/virtualchapel.html A church-maintained virtual tour of a typical meetinghouse]; The church's online &quot;Meetinghouse Locator&quot; can be used to find locations of church buildings and meeting times.;[http://www.mormon.org/worshipwithus Worship With Us];

Regional church organizations larger than single congregations include stakes, missions, districts, areas, and regions.

= Priesthood hierarchy=


The church has a hierarchical structure, with clearly defined stewardships or realms of responsibility for the various offices. Those who hold such offices do not elect to do so but are &quot;called&quot; by someone of a higher authority in the church; all are laity and are not paid for their service.

The leader of the church is termed President, and church members revere him as a prophet, seer, and revelator. The prophet is believed to hold the same divine calling as biblical prophets, and his responsibility is primarily over the church as a whole. His stewardship extends over the whole human family on earth as the Lord's mouthpiece. He is entitled to guide the church through revelation, acting as God's spokesman. The President of the Church serves as such until death. Historically, the senior apostle of the church has always become the new President of the Church. The current president is Gordon B. Hinckley.

The First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the Presiding Bishopric and the First and Second Quorums of the Seventy are all referred to as ''general authorities'' because they direct the work of the entire church throughout the world. The members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are accepted by the church as prophets, seers, and revelators. 

Other church authorities are referred to as ''area authorities'' and ''local authorities'' and include all other Quorums of the Seventy, mission presidents, stake presidents, bishops, and other priesthood quorum presidents. 

The church has no salaried ministry; however, general authorities who demonstrate need receive stipends from the church, using income from church-owned investments.;Ludlow, Daniel H., Latter-day Prophets Speak: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Church Presidents, 1948/1993, Ch. 32; All area and local authorities are unpaid and continue in their normal occupations while serving in leadership positions.

The church teaches that revelation from God continues today, but only as far as one's own responsibility is concerned. Accordingly, revelation to direct the entire church comes to the president; revelation to direct a stake comes to the stake president; for a ward, to the bishop; and so forth. Latter-day Saints also believe that individuals can receive personal revelation and divine guidance in raising their families and managing their personal affairs. Because of their belief in modern revelation, Latter-day Saints give significant weight to the teachings of their church leaders. They revere the words their prophets and general authorities speak when &quot;moved upon by the Holy Ghost&quot;;. Members are encouraged to listen carefully to general conference but also feel they can rely on personal revelation in order to appreciate validity of such statements. (see Joseph F. Smith, in Conference Report, April 1902, and [http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1981.htm/ensign%20november%201981.htm/conference%20time.htm Howard W. Hunter] in Conference Report, October 1981.); as modern-day scripture, and members are encouraged to ponder and pray for revelation regarding the truthfulness of such statements.

=Auxiliary organizations=


Under the control of the priesthood hierarchy are five auxiliary organizations that fill various roles in the church: Relief Society, Young Men Organization, Young Women Organization, Primary, and Sunday School.

The Relief Society is the church's women's organization. Founded in 1842 in Nauvoo, Illinois, and with the motto &quot;Charity Never Faileth&quot;, the organization today includes more than 5 million women in over 165 countries.;; Every Latter-day Saint woman age 18 or older is a member of the Relief Society.

The Young Men and Young Women Organizations are composed of adolescents aged 12 to 18. Members often have an additional meeting during the week (referred to as Mutual), which can involve an activity, game, service project, or instruction. The young men and women may meet separately or take part in a combined activities. In the United States and Canada, the young men participate in Scouting, including efforts to gain an award unique to the LDS Church, &quot;On my Honor.&quot; Young men throughout the church also work towards earning the church's &quot;Duty to God&quot; award. Young women participate in a comparable program called Personal Progress. Both the young men and the young women are encouraged to live by the standards outlined in the church's &quot;For the Strength of Youth&quot; booklet.

The Primary is an organization for children up to age 12, founded in 1878. It provides classes, music, and activities for children during the second and third hours of the Sunday meeting schedule.

The LDS Sunday School organization provides classes for adolescents and adults during the second hour of the Sunday meeting schedule. It provides a variety of classes, including introductory classes for new members and nonmembers, and gospel doctrine classes for more experienced members. Adolescents are grouped into classes by age.

=Programs=
Missionary program
 

Young men between the ages of 19 and 25 who meet minimum standards of worthiness and preparation are encouraged to serve a two-year, full-time proselytizing mission. Women who desire to serve a mission must be at least 21 and generally serve 18-month missions. Retired married couples are encouraged to serve missions as well, and their length of service varies from three to 36 months.;;

There are 347 missions and approximately 53,000 full time proselytizing missionaries serving throughout the world.; In addition, about 3,552 missionaries are on special assignment missions, serving as health care specialists, doctors, craftsmen, artisans, construction supervisors, agricultural experts and educators for developing countries and educators, family history researchers and leadership trainers.;

In June 2007, the church marked the induction of its one millionth missionary since 1830.;

Church Educational System


Latter-day Saints believe in the value of education. Joseph Smith taught that &quot;the glory of God is intelligence.&quot;;; Accordingly, the church maintains Brigham Young University, Brigham Young University–Idaho (formerly Ricks College), Brigham Young University Hawaii, and LDS Business College. The church also has religious education programs. ''Seminary'' is a program for secondary school students held daily in conjunction with the school year. The Institute of Religion and the LDS Student Association programs serve young adults between the ages of 18 and 30 and those enrolled in post-secondary education institutions with church-owned buildings near university and college campuses designated for the purpose of religious education and cultural socialization.

In addition, the church sponsors a low-interest educational loan program known as the Perpetual Education Fund. This fund is designed to benefit young men and women from less developed parts of the world who have served a mission, returned to their home, and need further education to become productive citizens in their respective countries. As they finish their education and enter the work force, they then are able to pay back the funds provided so that other individuals can attend both vocational technical schools and university.

Welfare Program



Members of the church donate fast offerings on Fast Sunday and at other times for the purpose of helping those who are poor or financially struggling.The bishop will meet with a family, or the head(s) of a family to determine whether and how much help they need from the church.The church strongly encourages its members to be self-reliant, so these meetings will usually include a plan on how to get the family back on its own feet.This welfare program is not only available to members of the church, but to any needy members of the community.In fact, the church has a very broad humanitarian effort of the church, which helps not only those who are going through financial struggles, but also victims of natural disasters or other devastating events.All of these services are paid for by charitable donations and are run by volunteer workers.

=Finances=

The church does not release church-wide financial statements to its members or the public, but as of 1997 it was estimated to be one of the world's wealthiest churches per capita.;Biema, David Van. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986794,00.html Kingdom Come]. ''Time Magazine'', Vol. 150 No. 5, August 4, 1997 (estimating the church's value at over $30 billion).; Its for-profit, non-profit, and educational subsidiary entities are audited by an independent accounting firm: as of 2007, Deloitte &amp; Touche.;[http://www.lds.org/deserettrust/why.html &quot;Why Deseret Trust Company?&quot;] Accessed 15 May 2007.;;[http://sec.edgar-online.com/1995/04/10/00/0000950134-95-000692/Section3.asp Belo Corp Form 8-K.]Accessed 16 May, 2007.;;&quot;[http://finserve.byu.edu/files/archives/Handouts/November%202005/Finance%20Section%20Draft%207-Without%20Requirements.doc Financial Planning]&quot;. finserve.byu.edu. Accessed 16 May 2007.; The church receives most of its money from tithes (ten percent of a member's income) and ''fast offerings'' (money given to the church to assist individuals in need). About ten percent of its funding also comes from income on investments and real estate holdings.;[http://mormoninquiry.typepad.com/mormon_inquiry/2004/10/lds_revenues_an.html Mormon Inquiry article]; 

The church uses its funds to construct and maintain buildings and other facilities, as well as providing social welfare and relief and supporting missionary, educational, and other church-sponsored programs.;; The church has also invested in business and real estate ventures such as Bonneville International, Deseret Book Company, and cattle ranches in Utah, Florida, and Canada.

Culture

Due to the differences in lifestyle promoted by church doctrine and history, a distinct culture has grown up around members of the church. It is primarily concentrated in the Rocky Mountains, but as membership of the church spreads around the world, many of its more distinctive practices follow, such as following the Word of Wisdom, a health code prohibiting the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, coffee and tea, and other addictive substances.;See Doctrine &amp; Covenants, Section 89.; Because of such prohibitions, the culture in areas of the world with a high concentration of Mormons tends to reflect these restrictions.;Salt Lake Tribune Editorial, [http://www.sltrib.com/ci_4903619 ''Liquor stores: Banning phone listings, stores won't stop abuse''].;

Meetings and outreach programs are held regularly and have become part of the Latter-day Saint culture.

=Home, family, and personal enrichment=
Four times a year the adult women (members of the church's Relief Society) attend a Home, Family, and Personal Enrichment Meeting (formerly known as Homemaking Meeting). The meeting may consist of a service project, or of attending a social event, or of various classes being offered. Additional Enrichment activities are offered for women with similar needs and interests.

=Social events and gatherings=
LDS stake center. Stake centers serve as meetinghouses for local congregations and headquarters for the local stake.
In addition to these regularly scheduled meetings, additional meetings are frequently held at the meetinghouse. Auxiliary officers may conduct leadership meetings or host training sessions and classes. The ward or branch community may schedule social activities at the meetinghouse, including dances, dinners, holiday parties and musical presentations. Other popular activities are basketball, family history conferences, youth and singles conferences, dances and various personal improvement classes. Church members may also reserve the building for personal or family use, to accommodate such events as music recitals, family reunions, weddings and receptions, birthdays, or funerals.

=Media community=
The culture has created substantial business opportunities for independent LDS media. The largest of these communities are LDS cinema, LDS fiction, LDS websites, and LDS graphical art like photography and paintings. The church owns a chain of bookstores called Deseret Book which provide an avenue for much of this media to be sold. This culture also resides outside of heavily Mormon populations and many LDS bookstores exist near temples where members commonly visit. Some of the titles that have become popular outside of the LDS community are ''The Work and the Glory'' novels and ''The Other Side of Heaven'' movie. There are a number of works that have been successful only within the LDS community. These works generally elaborate on LDS culture or historical fiction in some manner.

Criticism

The church has been subject to significant criticism since its early years in New York and Pennsylvania.The criticism often focused on the church's rapid growth and unusual doctrines.Criticism continued after the church settled in Missouri, culminating in the 1838 Mormon War. After the church relocated to Illinois, criticism persisted and led to the assassination of Joseph Smith, Jr. in 1844. After Smith's death, the Succession Crisis ensued, and various denominations of the LDS movement struggled for power, levying criticisms against each other, primarily regarding authority or doctrine. In the late 1800's, many criticized the LDS church, the largest branch, for its practice ofCriticism of LDS#Polygamy|polygamy, and federal legislators actively began passing laws designed to weaken the LDS church. Throughout the history of the movement, critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith's revelations, and the historicity of the Book of Mormon and the Book of Abraham. Notable 20th century critics include Jerald and Sandra Tanner, who published ''[http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/changecontents.htm The Changing World of Mormonism]'' In recent years, the internet has provided a new forum for critics, including sites such as ''[http://exmormon.org Exmormon.org]''. In modern times, criticism often focuses on claims of Criticism of LDS#Homophobia|intolerant attitudes, Criticism of LDS#Racism|racism, Criticism of LDS#Sexism|sexist policies, and Criticism of LDS#Finances|secrecy.
