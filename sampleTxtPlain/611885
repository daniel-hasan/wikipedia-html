The A38(M) is a motorway in Birmingham, England.It is 2&amp;nbsp;miles (3.2&amp;nbsp;km) long and was opened on May 24, 1972.;[http://www.iht.org/motorway/a38mastonstat.htm The Motorway Archive A38(M) - Dates]; It forms part of the A38 and is also known as the Aston Expressway.

Tidal flow
The Expressway was the first road in the UK to introduce tidal flow to allow better management of traffic.

In the morning, there are normally four lanes for Birmingham city centre bound traffic and two lanes for traffic out of the city. In the evening rush hour, this pattern is reversed and four lanes are made available to outbound traffic and two lanes towards the city centre. At all other times, the road runs with three lanes in each direction. 

At all times a central buffer lane is maintained to ensure that traffic does not pass in adjacent lanes.

Route
The A38(M) runs from the A5127through Spaghetti Junction where the A38 joins and then shortly after traffic from the M6 motorway also joins. It then enters a tidal flow section with a total of seven lanes.Lane use is controlled by means of electronic overhead signs, with one lane always closed to create a buffer between the two directions of travel â€“ there is no central reservation. Access to the centre lane, which contains a drainage channel, is now forbidden to motorcycles because of a fatal accident which happened when one of the drainage covers dislodged.;[http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/a38m/ CBRD Motorway Database - A38(M)];

The route is on a bridge as it passes through Aston; this section cuts through the grounds of Aston Hall.;[http://www.iht.org/motorway/a38mastonexp.htm The Motorway Archive - A38(M)]; The road passes through its first junction after one mile. It then enters a cutting before reaching the second junction, where the tidal flow ends as does the motorway. The motorway is curved in Aston to avoid an Ansells brewery. The brewery was demolished before the road was finished.; The motorway is also crossed by a gantry which used to house a vinegar pipeline, carrying the condiment from one part of the HP Sauce factory to the other. Once, in the 1970s, this leaked, damaging the paintwork on several passing cars.

Due to the nature of the road, the speed limit is reduced to 50 mph (80 km/h). There are with no speed cameras.
