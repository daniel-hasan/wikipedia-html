The M/F ''Isle of Inishmore'' is a roll-on roll-off passenger cruise ferry currently owned and operated by Irish Ferries and is currently used on the Pembroke, Wales — Rosslare, County Wexford, Ireland route.It entered service on 4 October 1996 and was then one of Europe's largest car ferries.

Construction
Construction of the Isle of Inishmore began in 1995 at the now-closed Van der Giessen de Noord shipyard in Krimpen aan den IJssel, near Rotterdam.The ship is named after the island of ''Inis Mór'' on the Irish west coast.

Statistics and complement
Being 182.5 metres long and having a gross tonnage of 34,031 tons (96,365 m³), the Isle of Inishmore is capable of carrying 2,200 passengers and has space for 802 cars on the lower decks. The crew can number up to approximately 100, although it is not usual for such a large number to be needed. The bulk of the crew at peak times is made up of the catering staff who attend to the needs of the passengers. The balance of the crew is made up of Deck and Engine departments who are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the vessel. 
The ship has proved to be popular with lorry drivers and tourists alike. 

Propulsion is provided by four Sulzer 8 cylinder ZA40S medium speed 4stroke diesel engines, developing 6000kW each. Each Engine burns 2.5 tons/hour of heavy fuel oil at service speed.
The main engines are geared onto two shafts which drive controlled pitch propellors. This eliminates the need for reversing gear. 
Electrical power is delivered either by the 3 sulzer 8 cylinder S20 diesel driven alternators providing 1160kW each, or by the shaft-driven alternators (2800kW) which are used at sea. 
Each of the two rudders is controlled by a rotary vane steering gear system, which is extremely compact and reliable. 
Two bow thrusters (2400kW each) aid manouevring in port. 
Two retractable fin stabilisers are fitted to reduce the effect of rolling in open sea.
