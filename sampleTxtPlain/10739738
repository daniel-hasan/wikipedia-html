Faye Morton is a fictional character in the BBC medical drama ''Holby City'', portrayed by actress Patsy Kensit. The character first appeared on January 30, 2007 in the episode &quot;Into the Dark&quot; - List of Holby City episodes/Series Nine#Series Nine .282006-2007.29|Series 9, Episode 17 of the program. Kensit had made a former unrelated guest appearance on ''Holby City's'' sister show Casualty in 2001.

The character's role in the show is that of mysterious femme fatale - seemingly meek and shy but with a murderous past,;; and little aversion to deception and theft.;; Her introductory storyline (shot on location in Dubai) in which she kills her husband and leaves for Holby, proved so popular that Kensit was shortlisted 'Best Actress' in the 2007 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards for her portrayal of the character within three months of arriving on the show.;; However, the dramaticism of the character's storylines and the manner in which they reflect upon real NHS nurses has come under heavy criticism.;

Creation
=Background=

Faye Morton was one of six new characters to join ''Holby City's'' cast in List of Holby City episodes/Series Nine#Series Nine .282006-2007.29|Series 9.;;
Since List of Holby City episodes/Series Eight#Series Eight .282005-2006.29|Series 8 Episode 10 &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;, and the departure from the show of its Maternity ward, the series has focused on three central wards - two surgical wards and an Acute Assessment Unit. Prior to the introduction of the character of Faye, there were just two Nurse#Nursing titles|Ward Sisters between these three wards - Chrissie Williams and Kyla Tyson.This imbalance was redressed with Faye's arrival and fast promotion from Nurse#Nursing titles|Bank Nurse to Sister of Holby City#Current wards|Keller Ward.;;

Early publicity for the character gave her name as 'Eliza Clark'.It is unknown at what stage in creation this changed to 'Faye Morton' - while Faye was the name announced by the BBC with the news of Kensit's casting in December 2005,; the actress was still referring to her character as Eliza as late at November 2006, when interviewed for the Inside Soap Yearbook 2007.;;

=Casting=

Although Faye did not first appear on-screen until February 2007, the announcement that Patsy Kensit had been cast as the character was made on December 14, 2005.;; ''Holby City's'' Executive Producer Richard Stokes and Series Producer Emma Turner said of Kensit's casting: &quot;We are delighted to confirm that Patsy Kensit is joining the cast of Holby City. She's a talented and popular actress who lights up the screen.&quot;;; Kensit herself commented,



Kensit also spoke of the forty-five minute commute to work on ''Holby'' as a deciding factor in her move from her previous role inITV soap ''Emmerdale'' - the long journey to and from filming the latter show cutting heavily into her time available to spend with her two sons.;; She described Faye as her dream role,;; and revealed that in preparation for portraying the character, she spent three days shadowing a real nurse,; as well as witnessing open heart surgery at University College Hospital, London, in order to bring realism to the part.; Kensit said of the experience:

In 2001, Kensit had made a guest appearance in List of Casualty episodes VII#Series Sixteen .282001-2002.29|Series 16 of ''Holby City's'' sister show ''Casualty'', appearing as a domestic abuse victim in episode 14, &quot;Happily Ever After&quot;.;; She gave what TV critic Ian Hyland billed &quot;a convincing performance&quot;,;; before moving on to a long term role in ''Emmerdale''.;; Prior to this move into television roles, Kensit had predominantly worked in films, but explained upon joining the cast of ''Holby'':



The Daily Mirror's television critic Jim Shelley has noted that Kensit's casting in the role follows a recent trend of ''Holby City'' producers for hiring established actors, including comedian Adrian Edmondson and ''Jesus of Nazareth'' star Robert Powell.;;

Development
=Personality=

Initial publicity for the character stressed her enigmatic origins, with the BBC billing her &quot;a nurse who has more than a few secrets to hide and an attitude that cannot fail to ruffle the feathers of her colleagues.&quot;;; This was reflected in her first on-screen appearance, whereby she simply arrived at Holby City Hospital one day and requested that registrars Jac Naylor and Joseph Byrne help her secure a nursing position without having to officially mention her previous employment in Dubai.;; How the three characters had come to meet and what had occurred between them was not revealed until two months later,; and to present, the character very rarely references her own past.

In terms of attitude, the character is generally reluctant to draw attention to herself - worrying about being recognised by Kyla Tyson's policeman husband Minor characters in Holby City#Relatives 2|Harvey following her arrest,;; and cooling off her developing relationship with Cardiothoracic Registrar Sam Strachan when led to believe he had been gossiping about their tryst.;; However, she has been seen to be highly principled with regard to her career, and was the only member of nursing staff to refuse to join union action in episode &quot;Countdown&quot;. Her lack of fear in challenging Staff Surgeon Thandie Abebe's patient care in episode &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, regardless of negative reaction of her colleagues, led Consultant General Surgeon Dan Clifford to promote her on the spot to the position of Nurse#Nursing titles|Ward Sister.;

In discussing the character, The Daily Express described her as &quot;Gregarious...likes a gossip, but she's emotionally vulnerable&quot;,; while ''Holby'' actress Tina Hobley compared her to her own character, Chrissie Williams, explaining that &quot;Faye is a quieter character all round who will do anything for an easy life, whereas Chrissie likes to stir up a bit of drama. I think she sees Faye as a goody two shoes.&quot;; A darker side to the character's personality has also been explored, from her calm reaction to her husband's death,; to her moral ambivalence at stealing a ring left to Jac Naylor in an attempt to win favour with Joseph Byrne.;

=Relationships=

Currently, the character's relationship history prior to arriving in Holby remains largely an enigma. Although the BBC state she has been married three times,;; only her most recent husband Minor characters in Holby City#Relatives 2|James has ever been mentioned on-screen.While it was never explicitly shown to be so, it was heavily implied in flashback episode &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; that Faye was responsible for his death.; Commenting on this aspect of her character, Kensit explained that:
Sam dates both Faye and Chrissie at the same time

;}}

Shortly after arriving in Holby, the character began a tentative relationship with Cardiothoracic Registrar Sam Strachan. The situation soon escalated into a love triangle, with Sam reigniting his former relationship with Faye's colleague, Matron Chrissie Williams.Kensit said of the relationship in August 2007, as the storyline was ongoing: &quot;For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now.But Faye is not as sweet as she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!&quot;;;

Upon discovering Sam's infidelity, the character terminated their relationship, and has now most recently been romantically linked with Joseph Byrne.Kensit has confirmed that Faye &quot;has a soft spot for (him)&quot;,; although it has been questioned whether she is more interested in him, or the inheritance he recently received following his father's death.;;

In terms of friendships, the character immediately got along well with Acting Sister Kyla Tyson, and supported her through the death of her husband and loss of her son to foster care.;; ''Holby'' actress Tina Hobley, who plays character Chrissie Williams, has also commented: &quot;I'd like there to be more development with Chrissie and Faye's relationship as they've only really had Sam as a common interest up until now.I just hope its friendship that develops, because I can't bear all that bitchy cat-fighting stuff.&quot;;;
