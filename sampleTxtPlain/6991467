A fully connected network is a mesh network in which each of the nodes is connected to each other. A fully connected network doesn't need to use switching nor broadcasting. However, its major disadvantage is that the number of connections grows quadratically with the number of nodes, per formula

:;c= \frac{n^2-n}{2}.\, ;

and so it is extremely impractical for large networks. A two-node network, one of the most common network types, is technically a fully connected network.
