Desmond Mpilo Tutu (born 7 October 1931) is a South African cleric and activist who rose to worldwide fame during the 1980s as an opponent of apartheid.Tutu was elected and ordained the first black South African Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa, and primate of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa (now the Anglican Church of Southern Africa). He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism, and the Magubela prize for liberty in 1986.He is committed to stopping global AIDS and has served as the honorary chairman for the Global AIDS Alliance. In February 2007 he was awarded Gandhi Peace Prize by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, president of India.

He was generally credited with coining the term Rainbow Nation as a metaphor for post-apartheid South Africa after 1994 under African National Congress rule.The expression has since entered mainstream consciousness to describe South Africa's ethnic diversity.

Background
Desmond Mpilo Tutu was born in Klerksdorp, Transvaal on 7 October, 1931. Tutu'sfamily moved to Johannesburg when he was 12 years old. Although he wanted to become a physician, his family could not afford the training, and he followed his father's footsteps into teaching. Tutu studied at the Pretoria Bantu Normal College from 1951 through 1953, and went on to teach at Johannesburg Bantu High School, where he remained until 1957.He resigned following the passage of the Bantu Education Act, in protest of the poor educational prospects for African South Africans. He continued his studies, this time in theology, and in 1960 was ordained as an Anglican minister. He became chaplain at the University of Fort Hare, a hotbed of dissent and one of the few quality universities for African students in the southern part of Africa.

Tutu left his post as chaplain and travelled to King's College London, (1962–1966), where he received his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Theology. He returned to Southern Africa and from 1967 until 1972 used his lectures to highlight the circumstances of the African population. He wrote a letter to B.J. Vorster|Prime Minister Vorster, in which he described the situation in South Africa as a &quot;powder barrel that can explode at any time.&quot;The letter was never answered. From 1970 to 1972, Tutu lectured at the National University of Lesotho .

In 1972 Tutu returned to the UK, where he was appointed vice-director of the Theological Education Fund of the World Council of Churches, at Bromley in Kent. He returned to South Africa in 1975 and was appointed Anglican Dean of Johannesburg—the first African person to hold that position.

In 1984 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace, as a gesture of support for him and The South African Council of Churches which he led at that time.

In 1987 Tutu was awarded the Pacem in Terris Award. It was named after a 1963 encyclical letter by Pope John XXIII that calls upon all people of good will to secure peace among all nations. Pacem in Terris is Latin for 'Peace on Earth.'

Personal life

He has been married to Leah Nomalizo Tutu since 1955. They have four children:Trevor Thamsanqa Tutu, Theresa Thandeka Tutu, Naomi Nontombi Tutu and Mpho Andrea Tutu, all of whom attended the Waterford Kamhlaba School in Swaziland.

In 1996, Tutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer.[http://www.bbc.co.uk]

In Spring 2007, he joined 600 college students and sailed around the world with Semester at Sea.;[http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=621 &quot;Nobel Peace Prize Winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu to Sail with Semester at Sea for Entire Spring Semester&quot;], www.Virginia.edu, accessed January 5 2008;

Political work
In 1976 protests in Soweto, also known as the Soweto Riots, against the government's use of Afrikaans as a compulsory medium of instruction in black schools became a massive uprising against apartheid.From then on Tutu supported an economic boycott of his country.

Desmond Tutu was Bishop of Lesotho from 1976 until 1978, when he became Secretary-General of the South African Council of Churches. From this position, he was able to continue his work against apartheid with agreement from nearly all churches. Tutu consistently advocated reconciliation between all parties involved in apartheid through his writings and lectures at home and abroad. Though he was most firm in denouncing South Africa's white-ruled government, Tutu was also harsh in his criticism of the violent tactics of some anti-apartheid groups such as the African National Congress and denounced terrorism and Communism.

On 16 October 1984, Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.The Nobel Committee cited his &quot;role as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa.&quot;;; 

Tutu became the first black person to lead the Anglican Church in South Africa on 7 September 1986. In 1989 he was invited to Birmingham, England, United Kingdom as part of Citywide Christian Celebrations.Tutu and his wife visited a number of establishments including the Nelson Mandela School in Sparkbrook.

After the fall of apartheid, he headed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, for which he was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize in 1999.

In 2003, he was elected to the Board of Directors of the International Criminal Court's Trust Fund for Victims.;Amnesty International, 12 September 2003, ''[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGIOR300072003?open&amp;of=ENG-391 Amnesty

Politics and political views
= On homosexuality=

In the debate about Anglican views of homosexuality he has opposed Christian discrimination against homosexuals.Commenting days after the 5 August 2003 election of Gene Robinson, an openly gay man to be a bishop in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, Desmond Tutu said, &quot;In our Church here in South Africa, that doesn't make a difference. We just say that at the moment, we believe that they should remain celibate and we don't see what the fuss is about.&quot;;&quot;;

;
Declared Tutu: &quot;I am deeply saddened at a time when we've got such huge problems ... that we should invest so much time and energy in this issue...I think God is weeping.&quot;
;
...
;
&quot;Jesus did not say, 'If I be lifted up I will draw ''some.&quot;Jesus said, 'If I be lifted up I will draw all, all, all, all, ''all''. Black, white, yellow, rich, poor, clever, not so clever, beautiful, not so beautiful. It's one of the most radical things. All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all. All belong. Gay, lesbian, so-called straight. All, ''all'' are meant to be held in this incredible embrace that will not let us go. ''All''.&quot;
;;
&quot;Isn't it sad, that in a time when we face so many devastating problems – poverty, HIV/AIDS, war and conflict – that in our Communion we should be investing so much time and energy on disagreement about sexual orientation?&quot;
[The Communion, which] &quot;used to be known for embodying the attribute of comprehensiveness, of inclusiveness, where we were meant to accommodate all and diverse views, saying we may differ in our theology but we belong together as sisters and brothers&quot; now seems &quot;hell-bent on excommunicating one another. God must look on and God must weep.&quot;;;
;

Since then Dr. Tutu has increased his criticism of conservative attitudes to homosexuality within his own church, equating homophobia with racism. Stating at a conference in Nairobi that he is &quot;deeply disturbed that in the face of some of the most horrendous problems facing Africa, we concentrate on 'what do I do in bed with whom'&quot;.;http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-3528.html;

In an interview with BBC Radio 4 on the 18th of November 2007, Archbishop Desmond Tutu accused the church of being obsessed with homosexuality and declared: 

&quot;If God, as they say, is homophobic, I wouldn't worship that God.&quot;;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7100295.stm;

= United Nations=

The Nobel laureate has expressed support for the West Papuan independence movement, criticizing the United Nations' role in the takeover of West Papua by Indonesia.Tutu said:&quot;For many years the people of South Africa suffered under the yoke of oppression and apartheid. Many people continue to suffer brutal oppression, where their fundamental dignity as human beings is denied. One such people is the people of West Papua.&quot;


= On Mugabe=
Tutu has criticised human rights abuses in Zimbabwe, calling Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe a &quot;caricature of an African dictator&quot;, and criticising the South African government's policy of quiet diplomacy towards Zimbabwe.

He warned of corruption shortly after the election of the African National Congress government of South Africa, saying that they &quot;stopped the gravy train just long enough to get on themselves.&quot;;WGBH, date unknown.

= On slavery= 

In June 1999, Tutu was invited to give the annual Wilberforce Lecture in Kingston upon Hull, commemorating the life and achievements of the anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce. Tutu used the occasion to praise the people of the city for their traditional support of freedom and for standing with the people of South Africa in their fight against apartheid. He was also presented with the freedom of the city.

The Fall 2004 issue of ''Greater Good'' magazine

= Social psychology=
Tutu has contributed to the field of social psychology. His writing appeared in Greater Good Magazine, published by the Greater Good Science Center of the University of California, Berkeley.His contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships. His most recent article with Greater Good magazine is titled: &quot;Why to Forgive&quot;, which examines how forgiveness is not only personally rewarding, but also politically necessary in allowing South Africa to have a new beginning. However, Tutu states that forgiveness is not turning a blind eye to wrongs; true reconciliation exposes the awfulness, the abuse, the pain, the hurt, the truth. It could even sometimes make things worse. It is a risky undertaking but in the end it is worthwhile, because in the end only an honest confrontation with reality can bring healing.

= On Israel and relationship with the Jewish community=

Tutu has spoken of the significant role Jews played in the anti-Apartheid struggle in South Africa, has voiced support for Israel's security concerns, and has spoken against tactics of suicide bombing and incitement to hatred.;Desmond Tutu, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/comment/0,10551,706911,00.html Apartheid in the Holy Land], ''The Guardian'', April 29, 2002. ;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4403427,00.html Alternative link]; Accessed online 28 November 2006.; 
He is also an active and prominent proponent of the campaign for divestment from Israel, ;Desmond Tutu and Ian Urbina, [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020715/tutu Against Israeli apartheid], ''The Nation'' 275:4-5, June 27, 2002 (July 15, 2002 issue). Accessed online 28 November 2006.; 
and has likened Israel's treatment of Palestinians to the treatment of Black South Africans under apartheid.;;Tutu used the analogy on a Christmas visit to Jerusalem on 25 December 1989, when he said in a ''Haaretz'' article that he is a &quot;black South African, and if I were to change the names, a description of what is happening in Gaza and the West Bank could describe events in South Africa.&quot; (See Walter Ruby, &quot;Tutu says Israel's policy in terrorities remind him of SA&quot;, ''Jerusalem Post'', 1 February 1989, O1.)He made similar comments in 2002, speaking of &quot;the humiliation of the Palestinians at checkpoints and roadblocks, suffering like us when young white police officers prevented us from moving about&quot;.(See [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1957644.stm Tutu condemns Israeli 'apartheid'], BBC News, 29 April 2002. Accessed online 28 November 2006.)He has drawn attention to a letter signed by several hundred prominent Jewish South Africans drawing an explicit analogy between apartheid and current Israeli policies.;

In 1988, the American Jewish Committee noted that Tutu was strongly critical of Israel's military and other connections with apartheid-era South Africa, and quoted him as saying that Zionism has &quot;very many parallels with racism&quot;, on the grounds that it &quot;excludes people on ethnic or other grounds over which they have no control&quot;.While the AJC was critical of some of Tutu's views, it was dismissive of &quot;insidious rumours&quot; that he had made anti-Semitic statements.;[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1988_3_SpecialArticles.pdf American Jewish Year Book, 1988], American Jewish Committee, p. 50 (pdf document).The precise wording of Tutu's statement has been reported differently in different sources.A subsequent ''Toronto Star'' article indicates that he described Zionism &quot;as a policy that looks like it has many parallels with racism, the effect is the same.&quot; See Gordon Barthos, &quot;Israelis uneasy about Tutu's Yule visit&quot;, ''Toronto Star'', 20 December 1989, A2.;

Tutu preached a message of forgiveness during a 1989 trip to Israel's Yad Vashem museum, saying &quot;Our Lord would say that in the end the positive thing that can come is the spirit of forgiving, not forgetting, but the spirit of saying: God, this happened to us.We pray for those who made it happen, help us to forgive them and help us so that we in our turn will not make others suffer.&quot;;&quot;Tutu Urges Jews to Forgive The Nazis&quot;, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 27 December 1989, A20.;Some found this statement offensive, with Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center calling it “a gratuitous insult to Jews and victims of Nazism everywhere.” ;&quot;Tutu assailed&quot;, ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 30 December 1989, 13.;Tutu was subjected to racial slurs during this visit to Israel, with vandals writing &quot;Black Nazi pig&quot; on the walls of the St. George's Cathedral in East Jerusalem, where he was staying.;&quot;Tutu Urges Jews to Forgive The Nazis&quot;, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 27 December 1989, A20.;

In 2002, when delivering a public lecture in support of divestment, Tutu said &quot;My heart aches. I say why are our memories so short. Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation? Have they forgotten the collective punishment, the home demolitions, in their own history so soon? Have they turned their backs on their profound and noble religious traditions? Have they forgotten that God cares deeply about the downtrodden?&quot;;He argued that Israel could never live in security by oppressing another people, and continued, &quot;People are scared in this country [the US], to say wrong is wrong because the Jewish lobby is powerful - very powerful. Well, so what? For goodness sake, this is God's world! We live in a moral universe. The apartheid government was very powerful, but today it no longer exists. Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Pinochet, Milosevic, and Idi Amin were all powerful, but in the end they bit the dust.&quot;;The latter statement was criticized by some Jewish groups, including the Anti-Defamation League.;[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/UnitedNations_94/4933_94.htm &quot;ADL Blasts Appointment Of Desmond Tutu As Head Of U.N.

Beit Hanoun

Desmond Tutu was named to head a United Nations fact-finding mission to the Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanoun, where, in a November 2006 incident the Israel Defense Forces killed 19 civilians after troops wound up a week-long incursion aimed at curbing 2006 Israel-Gaza conflict|Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel from the town.;[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&amp;cid=1162378513178];.

Tutu cancelled the trip in mid-December, saying that Israel had refused to grant him the necessary travel clearance after more than a week of discussions. A spokesman from the Israeli foreign ministry indicated that no final decision had been made, to which Tutu responded, &quot;At times ''not'' making a decision ''is'' making a decision. We couldn't obviously wait in limbo indefinitely.&quot;;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/11/news/UN_GEN_UN_Israel_Tutu.php &quot;Desmond Tutu says Israel refused fact-finding mission to Gaza&quot;], ''International Herald Tribune'', 11 December 2006.; The Anti-Defamation League stated that the appointment of Tutu as head of the mission is not appropriate on the grounds that he would be a prepossessed observer, and criticized the mission for having not &quot;address[ed] the continuing barrage of Kassam rockets fired into Israel by Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, killing and maiming Israeli citizens...Tutu has already publicly expressed his anti-Israel views and his opinions regarding what happened in Beit Hanoun, and combined with the one-sided anti-Israel mandate provided by the resolution, the results of the mission are all-but preordained&quot;;;

= Nelson Mandela Foundation Lecture=

After a decade of freedom for South Africa, Archbishop Tutu was honored with the invitation to deliver the annual Nelson Mandela Foundation Lecture. On November 23, 2004 Tutu was given the address entitled, &quot;Look to the Rock from Which You Were Hewn'.This lecture, critical of the ANC-controlled government, stirred a pot of controversy between Tutu and Thabo Mbeki, calling into question &quot;the right to criticise.&quot;[http://www.nu.ac.za/ccs/default.asp?3,28,10,1763]After the first round of volleys were fired, South African Press Association journalist, Ben Maclennan reported Tutu's response as:;[http://www.armsdeal-vpo.co.za/quotes.html Quotes of the Week];

=War on Terror=

In January 2005, Tutu added his voice to the growing dissent over terrorist suspects held at Camp X-Ray in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, referring to detentions without trial as &quot;utterly unacceptable.&quot;

=HIV/AIDS=

On 20 April 2005, after Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger was elected as Pope Benedict XVI, Tutu said he was sad that the Roman Catholic Church was unlikely to change its opposition to condoms amidst the fight against HIV/AIDS in Africa: &quot;We would have hoped for someone more open to the more recent developments in the world, the whole question of the ministry of women and a more reasonable position with regards to condoms and HIV/AIDS.&quot;;;

=Ecumenism=

In February 2006 Tutu took part in the 9th Assembly of the World Council of Churches, held in Porto Alegre, Brazil. There he manifested his commitment to ecumenism and praised the efforts of Christian churches to promote dialogue to diminish their differences. For Desmond, &quot;a united church is no optional extra.&quot;

Chairman of The Elders

On July 18, 2007 in Johannesburg, South Africa, Nelson Mandela, Graça Machel, and Desmond Tutu convened &quot;The Global Elders, a group of world leaders to contribute their wisdom, leadership and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems.Mandela announced its formation in a speech on his 89th birthday.Archbishop Tutu is to serve as its Chair.Other founding members include Kofi Annan, Ela Bhatt, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Jimmy Carter, Li Zhaoxing, Mary Robinson, Muhammad Yunus and Aung San Suu Kyi, whose chair was left symbolically empty due to her confinement as a political prisoner in Burma.

“This group can speak freely and boldly, working both publicly and behind the scenes on whatever actions need to be taken,” Mandela commented.“Together we will work to support courage where there is fear, foster agreement where there is conflict, and inspire hope where there is despair.”

The Elders will be independently funded by a group of Founders, including Richard Branson, Peter Gabriel, Ray Chambers, Michael Chambers, Bridgeway Foundation, Pam Omidyar, Humanity United, Amy Robbins, Shashi Ruia, Dick Tarlow and the United Nations Foundation.

Quotes by Tutu

* &quot;When missionaries came to South Africa, we had the land, they had the Bible. Then they told us, 'Let's close our eyes and pray.' When we opened our eyes we saw that we have the Bible, they have the land.&quot;
* &quot;My heart aches. I say why are our memories so short. Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation? Have they forgotten the collective punishment, the home demolitions, in their own history so soon? Have they turned their backs on their profound andchosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.&quot;
* &quot;Good is stronger than evil; love is stronger than hate; light is stronger than darkness; life is stronger than death. Victory is ours, through him who loves us.&quot;
* &quot;If God, as they say, is homophobic, I wouldn’t worship that God.&quot; [http://www.liberalavenger.com/2007/11/19/im-glad-to-see-that-the-god-business-still-pays-well]

Criticism of Tutu

In August 2006 Archbishop Tutu publicly urged Jacob Zuma, the South African politician who had been accused of sexual crimes and corruption, to drop out of the ANC's presidential succession race. Zuma's personal advisor responded by accusing Tutu of having double standards and &quot;selective amnesia&quot; (as well as being old). Elias Khumalo claims the archbishop “had found it so easy to accept the apology from the apartheid government that committed unspeakable atrocities against millions of South Africans”, yet now “cannot find it in his heart to accept the apology from this humble man who has erred”. Tutu and Zuma’s public criticism of each other are reflections of a turbulent time in South African politics.;;
