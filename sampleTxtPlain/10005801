History
=Background=
Due to a variety of factors, including the deterioration of the main campus building dating from 1844 and the need for additional space, the university considered building a new building designed specifically for the university beginning in the 1850s.;Hines, Gustavus. ''Oregon and Its Institutions; Comprising a Full History of the Willamette University''. Carlton &amp; Porter, 1868.; Then on October 3 1860 the board of trustees for the school resolved to begin the process of building a new primary hall to be used by the university.; Reverend Alvin F. Waller was placed in charge of the efforts to raise the funds needed for a building.; However, this was unsuccessful and on November 19 1862 the board again passed a resolution calling for a new structure and forming a committee of Waller, Gustavus Hines, Josiah Lamberson Parrish, J. Lamson, and J.H. Moores to prepare plans.;

On December 2 1862, the trustees authorized subscriptions to be solicited and paid to Waller with a goal of $20,000.; On May 20 1863 the board met again and learned that $12,800 had been pledged and the board then set up a building committee of Waller, Hines, Moores, E.N. Cook, and Thomas Milton Gatch.; It was mainly through the efforts of the Reverend Waller that the hall was built.;; Several designs were then considered for the new building, and on February 22 1864 on a vote of 16 to 1 the board selected the final plan that called for a brick building with a stone foundation.; The foundation was to rise to a level three feet above the ground to prevent moisture from the ground seeping into the bricks.;

=Construction=
Construction of the new building began in February of 1864 with excavation of the basement.; This was on the north section of Willamette’s campus in downtown Salem.;; Then on July 24 1864, the cornerstone of the building was laid into place in a ceremony.; The President of the Board of Trustees, David Leslie, laid the cornerstone of the hall.;Salem Pioneer Cemetery [http://www.open.org/~pioneerc/pg26.html#LeslDavi132 David Leslie], Accessed: August 31, 2007.; This ceremony included a time capsule and a speech by Governor A. C. Gibbs.;

All of the bricks used in the construction were fired on campus using clay excavated from the construction site in order to build the foundation.; The builders ordered 500,000 bricks total for the construction project.;; Construction was completed in 1867 and the building was named University Hall.;[http://www.willamette.edu/tour/tour_flash.php Campus Tour]. Willamette University, Accessed: August 31, 2007.; The school “marched” from the old school building to the new and began using it on October 21 1867.; Total costs for the building were $40,000 at occupation with a need for approximately an additional $17,000 to finish and furnish the building.; The building was first used for classrooms, a library, parlors, recitation rooms, and some physical education in the attic.; Also in the early years the structure housed the chapel services of the school.; 

=Later years=
Waller with Mansard style roof
The old school building, the Oregon Institute, burned down in December of 1872 leaving University Hall as the only building on campus.;Cowger, Wright. ''The First Hundred Years: 1834-1934 Willamette University from Jason Lee to Carl Doney''. Willamette University, 1981.; Thus all departments were housed in the building including the College of Law from 1884 to 1923 when it moved to Eaton Hall and the Medical School from 1867 until 1880 when it moved to Portland.;Swenson, Eric. ''Willamette University College of Law: The First Hundred Years: An Illustrated History''. Willamette University College of Law, 1987.;; University Hall remained the only permanent campus building from 1872 when the Oregon Institute building burned down until 1906 when the Medical Building (now Art Building) was built.; Other school buildings such as the first Lausanne Hall were located off campus.; On September 16 1891 University Hall, the school's first brick building, caught on fire.;1840-1990 Keepsake Edition: Willamette University. ''Statesman Journal'', October 26, 1990.; As a result of the fire the top two floors of the building were destroyed including the roof.; The building was then re-built after the 1891 fire, but unlike the original plans it was constructed with a Mansard style roof.; Additionally, a square tower was also built on top in lieu of the original cupola which included a school bell.;;[http://photos.salemhistory.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/sj&amp;CISOPTR=969&amp;REC=3 Historic Photogrpahs Collection]. Salem Public Library, Accessed: August 31, 2007.;

In 1912 Willamette renamed the building in honor of the Reverend Alvan F. Waller who was instrumental in getting the hall built.; Then on December 17 1919, another fire swept through Waller Hall.; This second fire completely gutted the five-story building, but the exterior walls remained intact.; The Mansard roof and square tower were destroyed in the fire.; The university rebuilt the hall the following year, and used the original plans that included the round cupola but omitted the Mansard style roof and the square tower topping the structure.;

Architecture
Brick dentils
Waller Hall was built in the Renaissance style of architecture.; This red brick building was designed in the same proportions as a Greek cross.; Bishop Janes was responsible for proposing this use of the cross shape for the building.; Each of the two wings is 84 feet long and 44 feet wide with aedicule porches on the west, east, and north ends of the building.; Originally, the building was 100 feet tall as measured from the base of the building to the top of the dome.; The distance from the eaves of the structure to the base is 50 feet.; The basement of the building is 12 feet high and the first floor 16 feet high.; Both the second and third floors are 12 feet tall.;The hall has a cupola topping the structure. Other details include pilasters, dentils, and brick corbelling on the exterior and circular stairways on the interior.;

Waller Hall renovation covers next 100 years. ''Statesman Journal'', August 16, 2005.; Further renovations were completed in 2005 at a cost of $1.3 million to upgrade the 100-year-old windows to newer energy efficient models, repair the brick, fix leaks, install skylights, re-painting, and a slight lightening of the exterior red-brick coloring.; Waller Hall houses alumni relations, the school’s business office, human resources for the university, the office of communications, university relations, the President’s office, and other administrative functions.; Additionally, Cone Chapel is on the building's second floor and seats 300.; Cone Chapel features over a dozen stained glass windows;Cowan, Ron.
