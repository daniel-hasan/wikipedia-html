''Hot Fuzz'' is a 2007 British police action comedy film written by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright and starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. They worked together previously on the 2004 motion picture ''Shaun of the Dead'' (the first film in the Blood and Ice Cream trilogy), and the television series ''Spaced''. It was directed by Edgar Wright and produced by Nira Park. Wright revealed that he wanted to write and direct a cop film because &quot;there isn't really any tradition of cop films in the UK... We felt that every other country in the world had its own tradition of great cop action films and we had none.&quot;;;

The film debuted on February 14, 2007 in the UK and 20 April in the US. ''Hot Fuzz'' received multiple positive reviews, earning a 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and 81/100 from Metacritic. The total international box office gross reached $78,761,971 before its DVD premiere. Shortly after the film's release, two different soundtracks were released in the UK and US.

Plot
;

Nicholas Angel, an extremely dedicated and over-achieving police officer in London's Metropolitan Police Service, performs his duties so well that he makes everyone else look bad. As a result his superiors send him to a place where his talents won't be quite so embarrassing: the sleepy and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford in rural Gloucestershire. 

Once there, he is partnered with well-meaning but overeager and naïve police constable Danny Butterman, the son of local police inspector Frank Butterman. A committed action film fan, Danny is in awe of his new big city partner, who just might provide him with his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he longs for. Angel, meanwhile, struggles to adjust to the quiet and uneventful pace of the village, and despite clearing up several otherwise unnoticed crimes and misdemeanours in short order, soon finds his most pressing concern being a swan that has escaped from its owner.The other major crime seen, is a shoplifting incident at the supermarket (prior to the chase of the shop lifter, while Danny is browsing through the DVDs, a copy of Shaun of the Dead, also starring Pegg and Frost, can be seen). Angel and Danny eventually bond over action films and drinks at the local pub.

Angel and Butterman chase an escaped swan
Soon after Angel's arrival, a series of grisly murders disguised as accidents rock the village, all committed by an individual in a black hood and cloak. Increasingly convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and that the victims of the 'accidents' were murdered, Angel begins to clash with the other officers on the force. However, Angel refuses to drop the investigation and initially suspects Simon Skinner, the charming but sinister manager of the local Somerfield supermarket, of murdering the victims due to their involvement in a lucrative property deal. His confrontation with Skinner only reveals Skinner's apparent innocence and further damages Angel's credibility with his colleagues. 

After being ambushed in his hotel room by the cloaked murderer, who is unmasked as the trolley boy of the Somerfield supermarket acting under the instruction of Skinner, Angel is led to a nearby castle where he discovers the truth; Inspector Butterman, Skinner and the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance (NWA), intent on keeping Sandford's title of &quot;Village of the Year&quot;, have been murdering anyone who might damage the village's image. Inspector Butterman reveals that his wife committed suicide after the village lost the title many years ago, motivating him to use extreme methods to ensure Sandford wins the yearly contest. Angel discovers the bodies of various &quot;problem&quot; people whom the NWA disposed of, before being cornered and &quot;stabbed&quot; by Danny, apparently a member of the NWA. 

Having tricked the NWA into believing that Angel is dead, Danny instead drives him to the village limits and releases him, insisting that he knew nothing about their true activities. Danny urges Angel to flee, reasoning that no one would believe the truth about Sandford. However, whilst at a motorway service station, Angel sees the films that he and Danny bonded over on a nearby sales rack and is inspired to stop the NWA. He drives back to town and arms himself with weapons confiscated earlier in the film. After Angel meets with Danny in the village, the two begin to dispatch the members of the NWA in an increasingly destructive and frantic series of gun fights. 

Initially confronted by their colleagues in the Sandford Police Service (who are quickly persuaded of the truth), Angel and Danny take the battle to the supermarket. Skinner and Inspector Butterman flee, and are pursued by Angel and Danny to a nearby model village. There both Skinner and Inspector Butterman are apprehended. 

Although Angel's previous supervisors arrive from London begging Angel to return, as their crime rate has risen drastically, Angel elects to remain in Sandford. Back at the police station, the Sandford Police celebrate their triumph, but they are ambushed by the last remaining member of the NWA. He attempts to shoot Angel but Danny jumps in front of the gun and takes the bullets himself. In the resulting chaos a confiscated naval mine is triggered and the station is destroyed.

One year later, Angel lays flowers on a grave marked 'Butterman'; it is revealed that Danny has survived, and that the grave is his mother's. Angel has been promoted to Inspector and Danny to Sergeant, and the film ends as they go back on the beat together in Sandford.

While writing the script, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg intended to include Nick Frost as the partner for Pegg's character. Frost revealed that he would only do the film if he could name his character, and he chose &quot;Danny Butterman&quot;.;; Cast requirements included fifty people for speaking and non-speaking parts, and there were several casting calls for citizens of Wells to fill the roles,as the city was where the majority of the filming took place.;

=Cameos=
British singer and actor Joseph McManners played a cameo role as a tearaway schoolboy, however his background story and an entire sub-plot surrounding his character were cut from the final version and can only be found within the DVD bonus features.;[http://www.joemcmanners.com Official News Updates] at www.joemcmanners.com (accessed June 23, 2007); Stephen Merchant also makes two appearances as Mr Peter I Staker, who reports the escaped swan, and in a brief appearance at the end of the film, reunited with the swan when Angel is offered his job back in London. Director Edgar Wright revealed in an interview that Cate Blanchett was given her cameo role as a result of her being a fan of ''Shaun of the Dead''.;; Jim Broadbent similarly revealed his interest for ''Shaun'' and requested a role while meeting with Simon Pegg at a BAFTA awards ceremony.;; Wright met with director Peter Jackson while he was filming ''King Kong'', and Jackson suggested that he would be willing to do a cameo in the film. Edgar had Jackson wear a fake beard and pads to portray Father Christmas who stabs Nicholas Angel in the film's opening montage.;

Production
=Script and locations=

Director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg spent eighteen months writing the script.;; The first draft took eight months to develop, and after watching 138 cop-related films for dialogue and plot ideas and conducting over fifty interviews with police officers for research, the script was completed after another nine months.;; The title was based on the various two-word titles of action films in the 1980s and 90s.;; In one interview Wright declared that he &quot;wanted to make a title that really had very little meaning...like ''Lethal Weapon'' and ''Point Break'' and ''Executive Decision''.&quot; In the same interview, Pegg joked that when the many action films' titles were chosen that &quot;...all those titles seem to be generated from two hats filled with adjectives and nouns and you just, ‘Okay, that'll do.’&quot;;

(In the 30 August, 2007 edition of film critic Roger Ebert's &quot;Answer Man&quot; column, John Weckmueller of Milwaukee wrote that he had &quot;just listened to the commentary on the new DVD of Edgar Wright's ''Hot Fuzz''. The filmmakers mention that while writing the screenplay they were reading your ''Little Movie Glossary'' book, which they referred to as 'essential reading'&quot;.;/;)

During the latter half of 2005, Working Title approached several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Simon Pegg commented &quot;We're both from the West Country so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome&quot;.;; Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells,;; Edgar Wright's hometown. Wright has commented &quot;and Wells is very picturesque [...] I love it but I also want to trash it&quot;.;; The Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the village, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford,;; however the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots.;; Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track.;;

=Homage=
Wright has said that ''Hot Fuzz'' takes elements from his final amateur film, ''Dead Right'', which he described as both &quot;''Lethal Weapon'' set in Somerset&quot; and &quot;a ''Dirty Harry'' film in Somerset&quot;.;; He uses some of the same locations in both films including the Somerfield supermarket, where he used to work as a shelf-stacker.;;

Various scenes in ''Hot Fuzz'' feature a variety of action film DVDs and scenes from ''Point Break'' and ''Bad Boys II''. Director Edgar Wright revealed that he had to get permission from the actor in each video clip to use the clips and for the use of the DVD covers had to pay for the rights from the respective studios.;; The film parodies clichés used in other action movies. On the topic of perceived gun fetishes in these movies, Pegg has said &quot;Men can't do that thing, which is the greatest achievement of humankind, which is to make another human, so we make metal versions of our own penises and fire more bits of metal out of the end into peoples heads [...] It's our turn to grab the gun by the hilt and fire it into your face&quot;.;; Despite this, Pegg maintains that the film is not a spoof in that, &quot;They lack the sneer that a lot of parodies have that look down on their source material. Because we're looking up to it.&quot;;;

=Effects=
Ten artists were used to develop the visual effects for the film.;; To illustrate the destruction of the mansion as a result of the gas explosion, gas mortars were placed in front of the building to create large-scale fireballs. The wave of fire engulfs the camera, and to achieve that effect, gas mortars were used again but were fired upwards into a black ceiling piece that sloped up towards the camera.; When the sequence was shot at a high speed the flames appeared to surge across the ground. For one of the final scenes of the film, the Sandford police station is destroyed from an explosion. Part of the explosion was created by using a set model that showed its windows being blown out, while the building remained intact. The actual destruction of the building was depicted by exploding a miniature model of the station.;

Similar to the work in ''Shaun of the Dead'', blood and gore was prevalent throughout the film and visual effects supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood: &quot;In many ways, the more extreme you make it, the more people know it is stylized and enjoy the humor inherent in how ridiculous it is. It's rather like the (eventually) limbless Black Knight in ''Monty Python's Holy Grail''.&quot;; The most time-consuming sequence involving gore was for when the reporter's head is crushed by a section of a cathedral. A dummy was used against a green screen and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body. Over seventy gunfight shots were digitally added throughout the film and Briscoe also stated: &quot;The town square shootout, for example, is full of extra little hits scattered throughout, so that it feels like our hero characters really do have it all going off, all around them...It was a great demonstration of what a difference how individual, seemingly very trivial enhancements can make a difference when combined across a sequence.&quot;;

=Preparation and filming=
To prepare for their roles in the film, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost had to follow certain requirements. Pegg's contract stated that he had to adopt a strict diet and use three personal trainers to prepare him for the physically demanding scenes in the film. Frost was asked by Wright and Pegg to watch around twenty action films to warm him up for his role as a police officer, but he decided to only watch ''Bad Boys II''.;;

Filming commenced on March 19, 2006;; and lasted for eleven weeks.;; After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.;;

Promotion
The first two teaser trailers were released on October 16, 2006. Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost maintained several video blogs which were released at various times throughout the production of the film.;; Wright and Frost held a panel at the 2006 Comic-Con International|Comic-Con convention in San Diego, California to promote ''Hot Fuzz'', which included preliminary footage and a question and answer session.;; The two returned to the convention again in 2007 to promote the U.S. DVD release.;; Advanced screenings of the film took place on 14 February, 2007 in the UK and the world premiere was on February 16, 2007. The premiere included escorts from motorcycle police officers and the use of blue carpet instead of the traditional red carpet.;;

Reception
Critically, the movie received many positive reviews, and was rated as highly as ''Shaun of the Dead''.;; It has a 89% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes;; and has a high Metacritic score of 81 (out of a possible 100).;; Olly Richards of ''Empire'' said of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost: &quot;After almost a decade together they’re clearly so comfortable in each other’s presence that they feel no need to fight for the punchline, making them terrific company for two hours&quot;.;; Johnny Vaughan of ''The Sun'' already called it the &quot;most arresting Brit-com of 2007&quot;.;; Phillip French of ''The Observer'', who did not care for ''Shaun of the Dead'', warmed to the comedy team in this film.;; The film also received positive reviews stateside. Derek Elley of ''Variety'' praised Broadbent and Dalton, &quot;[who] are especially good as Angel's hail-fellow-well-met superior and oily No. 1 suspect&quot;.;;As a homage to the genre, the film was well received by screenwriter Shane Black.;

However, the ''The Daily Mirror'' only gave ''Hot Fuzz'' 2/5, stating that &quot;many of the jokes miss their target&quot; as the film becomes more action-based.;; ''Daily Mail'' also shared ''The Mirrors view, saying that &quot;It's the lack of any serious intent that means too much of it is desperately unamusing, and unamusingly desperate&quot;.;; Anthony Quinn of ''The Independent'' said &quot;The same impish spirit [as ''Spaced''] is uncorked here, but it has been fatally indulged&quot;.;;

The film generated £7.1 million in its first weekend of release in the UK on February 14, 2007.;; In the April 20 US opening weekend, the film grossed $5.8 million from only 825 theatres, making it the highest per-theatre average of any film in the top ten that week.;; Its opening weekend take beat the $3.3 million opening weekend gross of Pegg and Wright's previous film, ''Shaun of the Dead''. In its second weekend of release, Rogue Pictures expanded the film's theater count from 825 to 1,272 and it grossed $4.9 million, representing a 17% dip in the gross.;; As of November 1, 2007, ''Hot Fuzz'' has grossed $79,791,231 worldwide.; In nine weeks, the film earned nearly twice what ''Shaun of the Dead'' made in the U.S., and more than three times its gross in other countries.;;

DVD
The DVD was released on 11 June, 2007 in the UK and 8 June, 2007 in Ireland. Over one million DVDs were sold in the UK in the first four weeks of its release.;; Disc one of the two-disc set contains the feature film with four commentaries, outtakes, trailers, and TV spots, 'The Man Who Would Be Fuzz', 'Hot Funk' (not a music video but a brief poorly censored version of the film), Fuzz-o-meter, storyboards, and 'Flick Book: The Other Side'. Disc two contains twenty-two deleted scenes with optional commentary, a making of documentary, thirteen video blogs, featurettes, plot holes and comparisons, special effects feature, galleries, and some hidden easter eggs. The DVD also features Wright's last amateur film ''Dead Right'' which he described as &quot;Hot Fuzz without the budget&quot;. A making of ''Dead Right'' is also included on the second disc. Due to the above release date, the movie arrives on region 2 DVD earlier than the theatrical release date in Germany on June 14, 2007.;;

The US DVD and HD DVD release of ''Hot Fuzz'' came out on July 31, 2007. According to the official site, the HD DVD edition has more special features than the standard DVD release. The three-disc Collector's Edition was released on November 27, 2007.

Soundtrack

The soundtrack album, ''Hot Fuzz: Music from the Motion Picture'', was released on February 19, 2007 in the United Kingdom, and on April 17, 2007 in the United States and Canada. The UK release contains twenty-two tracks, and the US/Canada release has fourteen.

The film's score is by British composer David Arnold, who has scored the James Bond film series since 1997. The soundtrack album's &quot;Hot Fuzz Suite&quot; is a compilation of excerpts from Arnold's score.;;

Other music from the film is a mix of 1960s and 1970s British rock (The Kinks, T.Rex (band)|T.Rex, The Move, The Sweet, The Troggs, Arthur Brown, Cozy Powell), New Wave (Adam Ant, XTC) and indie UK and American rock (The Fratellis, Eels).;;; The soundtrack album features dialogue extracts by Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and other cast members, mostly embedded in the music tracks.;;

At times the music is diagetic in nature, for example when Timothy Dalton's character Simon Skinner drives by the fatal collision scene of Martin Blower and Eve Draper, the Dire Straits song, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is heard on Skinner's car radio. In another scene, involving the burning death of George Merchant, Skinner drives by with his car radio playing &quot;Fire&quot; by Arthur Brown.

The Dire Straits' &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; does not appear on the soundtrack album, but in his DVD commentary, director Edgar Wright notes the irony of having to pay Dire Straits to use the song after he had poked fun at the band in his previous film, ''Shaun of the Dead''.;

The song selection also includes some police-themed titles, including Supergrass' &quot;Caught by the Fuzz&quot; as well as &quot;Here Come the Fuzz&quot;, which was especially composed for the film by Jon Spencer's Blues Explosion.;;

American film director Robert Rodriguez contributed to the film's score, and is acknowledged in the UK album's liner notes. The liner notes also credit Nick Angel (the person whom the character is named after) and director Edgar Wright as executive producers, while British mashup and breakbeat DJ Osymyso is credited as soundtrack producer.;; Osymyso had worked with Pegg and Wright on their previous film, ''Shaun of the Dead''.
