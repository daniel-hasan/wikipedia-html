Józef Klemens Piłsudski (, December 5, 1867 &amp;ndash; May 12, 1935) was a Polish statesman, Field Marshal, first Chief of State (1918&amp;ndash;1922) and dictator (1926&amp;ndash;1935) of the Second Polish Republic, as well as head of its armed forces. He was born into an impoverished noble family with traditions dating back to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. From mid–World War I until his death, Piłsudski was a major influence on Poland's government and foreign policy, and an important figure in European politics.;; He is considered largely responsible for Poland having regained her independence in 1918, one hundred and twenty-three years after the last remnants of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had been partitioned out of existence in 1795.;;Anatol Lieven, ''The Baltic Revolution: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Path to Independence'', Yale University Press, 1994, ISBN 0300060785, [http://books.google.com/books?id=iz3NACNOpCAC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Pilsudski+Polish+independence&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=7cZmR9X2G6SEjAGuoZ2nAw&amp;sig=UF1oPw56pneIbaUzKQLxTtZkGb0 Google Book Search, p. 159].;;Jerzy Jan Lerski, ''Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966–1945'', Greenwood Press, 1996, ISBN 0313260079, [http://books.google.com/books?id=FPxhOu_n1VYC&amp;pg=PA441&amp;vq=chief+restorer&amp;dq=Pilsudski+Polish+independence&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=iJxuE4j82fjQgvWGYI-kkEwkYB0 Google Book Search, p. 441].;;Joseph Held, ''The Columbia History of Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century'', Columbia University

From his youth, Piłsudski desired the restoration of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In his early political life, he was an influential member and later leader of the Polish Socialist Party. He considered the Russian Empire to be the most formidable obstacle to Polish independence, and created the Polish Legions which would fight alongside the Austro-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian and German Empires to ensure Russia's defeat in World War I. Later in the war, he withdrew his support from the Central Powers to work with the Triple Entente for the defeat of the Central Powers. After World War I he was in charge of the Polish forces during the Polish-Soviet War (1919–21). From November 1918, when Poland regained its independence, until 1922, he was Poland's Chief of State (''Naczelnik Państwa'').

In 1923, as the Polish government became dominated by Piłsudski's chief opponents, the National Democrats, he withdrew from active politics.; Three years later, however, he returned to power in the May 1926 ''coup d'état'', becoming the ''de facto'' dictator of Poland. From then until his death in 1935, he concerned himself primarily with military and foreign affairs. To this day, Piłsudski is held in high regard by many, though he remains a controversial figure.;;;;Aviel Roshwald, Richard Stites, ''European Culture in the Great War: The Arts, Entertainment and Propaganda, 1914–1918'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, ISBN 0521013240, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521013240&amp;id=uteV3ytfmqQC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=Pilsudski+hero&amp;sig=pUTn7o9EK83j--_aOWyiwKGkgPQ Google Book Search, p. 60].;

=Early life=
Józef Piłsudski was born on December 5, 1867, at his family's manor in the village of Zulovo (), then part of the Russian Empire (now Zalavas, Lithuania). The area had been part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, itself a component of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, before the latter had been partitioned.;; Piłsudski (family)|The impoverished ''szlachta'' family;Oleksa Pidlutskyi, &quot;Postati XX stolittia&quot;, (Figures of the 20th century), Kiev, 2004, ISBN 9668290011.

Piłsudski as a schoolboy
Piłsudski, when he attended the Russian ''gymnasium'' at Vilna (nowVilnius), was not an especially diligent student.;; As a boy, along with his brothers Adam Piłsudski|Adam, Bronisław Piłsudski|Bronisław and Jan Piłsudski|Jan, he was introduced by his mother Maria, ''née'' Bilewicz, to Polish history and literature, which were suppressed by the Russian authorities.;MacMillan, Margaret, ''Paris 1919 : Six Months That Changed the World'', Random House Trade Paperbacks, 2003, ISBN 0375760520, p. 208.; His father, likewise named Józef, had fought in the January 1863 Uprising against the Russian occupation of Poland.;

The family resented the Russian government's Russification policies. Young Józef profoundly disliked having to attend Russian Orthodox Church services; and left school with an aversion not only for the Russian Tsar and the Russian Empire, but for the culture, which he knew well.;

In 1885 Piłsudski embarked on medical studies at the University of Kharkov (Kharkiv, Ukraine), where he became involved with ''Narodnaya Volya'', part of the Russian ''Narodniki'' revolutionary movement.;[http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3957301 Piłsudski Józef Klemens] by Andrzej Chojnowski. Entry in Polish PWN Encyclopedia.; In 1886 he was suspended for participating in student demonstrations.; He was rejected by the University of Dorpat (Tartu, Estonia), whose authorities had been informed of his political affiliation.; On March 22, 1887, he was arrested by Tsarist authorities on a false;&quot;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761558833/Pilsudski.html Pilsudski, Józef Klemens],&quot; Microsoft Encarta. Last accessed on 30 May 2006.; charge of plotting with Vilna socialists to assassinate Tsar Alexander III. In fact Piłsudski's main connection to the plot was the involvement in it of his elder brother, Bronisław.; [http://www.icrap.org/pl/cv.html Kalendarium wydarzeń życia Bronisława Piłsudskiego] (Calendar of events in the life of Bronisław Piłsudski). Retrieved on 2 August 2007.; Bronisław was sentenced to fifteen years' hard labor (''katorga'') in eastern Siberia.;;Urbankowski, op cit, p. 50.;

Józef received a milder sentence: five years' exile in Siberia, first at Kirensk on the Lena River, then at Tunka.;; While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Piłsudski was held for several weeks at a prison in Irkutsk. There he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt: after one of the inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance;;Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 62–66.; Piłsudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident.; For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment.;Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 68–69.; He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and to health problems that would plague him throughout life.;

During his years of exile in Siberia, Piłsudski met many ''Sybiraks'', including Bronisław Szwarce, who had almost become a leader of the January 1863 Uprising.;Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 74–77.; He was allowed to work in an occupation of his own choosing, and earned his living tutoring local children in mathematics and foreign languages; (he knew French, German and Lithuanian; [http://www.lrytas.lt/?id=11846508871183494575&amp;view=4 Marshal Piłsudski spoke to little Lithuanians in Lithuanian], by Izidorius Šimelionis, accessed on December 8, 2007.; in addition to Russian and, of course, his native Polish; he would later learn English).;Wacław Jędrzejewicz, Janusz Cisek, ''Kalendarium Życia Józefa Piłsudskiego'', Zaklad Narodowy im.

In 1892 Piłsudski returned from exile. In 1893 he joined the Polish Socialist Party (''PPS''); and helped organize its Lithuanian branch.;Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 88.; Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible internationalism he remained a Polish nationalist.;MacMillan, op. cit., p. 209.; In 1894, as its chief editor, he began publishing an bibuła|underground socialist newspaper, ''Robotnik (1894–1939)|Robotnik'' (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers.;;Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 93.;; In 1895, he became a PPS leader, and took the position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and that socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, as that combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.;

Piłsudski in 1899
In 1899, while an underground organizer, Piłsudski married a fellow socialist organizer, Maria Piłsudska|Maria Juszkiewiczowa, ''née'' Koplewska, but the marriage deteriorated when several years later Piłsudski began an affair with a younger socialist,; Aleksandra Piłsudska|Aleksandra Zahorska. Maria died in 1921, and in October that year Piłsudski married Aleksandra. They had two daughters, Wanda and Jadwiga, but this marriage was also troubled.; [http://biografie.genealogiapolska.pl/index2.php?a=2&amp;b=1352 Aleksandra Piłsudska], last accessed on 30 May 2006.;

In February 1900, after the Russian authorities found ''Robotniks underground printing press in Łódź, Piłsudski was imprisoned at the Warsaw Citadel but, after feigning mental illness in May 1901, he managed to escape from a mental hospital at Saint Petersburg with the help of a Polish physician, Władysław Mazurkiewicz (1871 - 1933)|Władysław Mazurkiewicz, and others, fleeing to Galicia, then part of Austria-Hungary.;

At the time, when almost all parties in Russian Poland and Lithuania took a conciliatory position toward the Russian Empire and aimed at negotiating within it a limited autonomy for Poland, Piłsudski's PPS was the only political force that was prepared to fight the Empire for Polish independence and to resort to violence in order to achieve that goal.;

On the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War (1904&amp;ndash;1905), in the summer of 1904, Piłsudski traveled to Tokyo, Japan, where he tried unsuccessfully to obtain that country's assistance for an uprising in Poland. He offered to supply Japan with intelligence in support of its war with Russia and proposed the creation of a Polish Legion from Poles,;Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 109–111.; conscripted into the Russian Army, who had been captured by Japan. He also suggested a Prometheism#Sources of Prometheism|&quot;Promethean&quot; project directed at liberating non-Russian ethnic communities living in the Russian Empire&amp;mdash;a goal that he later continued to pursue.;Edmund Charaszkiewicz, ''Zbiór dokumentów ppłk. Edmunda Charaszkiewicza'' (A Collection of Documents by Lt. Col. Edmund Charaszkiewicz), p. 56.;

Another notable Pole, Roman Dmowski, also traveled to Japan, where he argued against Piłsudski's plan, endeavoring to discourage the Japanese government from supporting at this time a Polish revolution which Dmowski felt would be doomed to failure.;; Dmowski, himself a Polish patriot, would remain Piłsudski's political arch-enemy to the end of Piłsudski's life.;Zamoyski, op cit, p. 332.; In the end, the Japanese offered Piłsudski much less than he had hoped for; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and its combat organisation, while the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.;;

In the fall of 1904, Piłsudski formed a paramilitary unit (the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party, or ''bojówki'') aiming to create an armed resistance movement against the Russian authorities.;; The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in Warsaw; on October 28, 1904, Russian Cossack cavalry attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on November 13, Piłsudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military.;Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 113–116.;; Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.;Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', pp. 117–18.;

During the 1905 Russian Revolution, Piłsudski played a leading role in events in Congress Poland.; In early 1905, he ordered the PPS to launch a general strike there; it involved some 400,000 workers and lasted two months until it was broken by the Russian authorities.; In June 1905, Piłsudski ordered to aid an uprising in Łódź.; During the &quot;Łódź insurrection (1905)|June Days,&quot; as the Łódź uprising came to be known, armed clashes broke out between Piłsudski's paramilitaries and gunmen loyal to Dmowski and his National Democrats.; On December 22, 1905, Piłsudski called for all Polish workers to rise up; the call went largely unheeded.;

Unlike the National Democrats, Piłsudski instructed the PPS to boycott the elections to the First Duma.; The decision to boycott the elections and try to win Polish independence through uprisings caused tension within the PPS, and in November 1906, the party fractured with many opposed to Piłsudski's leadership.; Piłsudski's faction came to be called the &quot;Old Faction&quot; or the &quot;Revolutionary Faction&quot; (''Starzy'' or ''Polska Partia Socjalistyczna - Frakcja Rewolucyjna|Frakcja Rewolucyjna''), while their opponents were known as the &quot;Young Faction,&quot; &quot;Moderate Faction&quot; or &quot;Left Wing&quot; (''Młodzi'', ''Frakcja Umiarkowana'', ''Polska Partia Socjalistyczna - Lewica|Lewica''). The &quot;Young&quot; sympathized with the Social Democrats of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania and believed that priority should be given to cooperation with Russian revolutionaries in toppling the Tsarist regime and creating a socialist utopia in which negotiations for independence would be easier.; Piłsudski and his supporters in the Revolutionary Faction continued to plot a revolution against Tsarist Russia that would secure Polish independence.; By 1909 Piłsudski's faction would again be the majority in the PPS, and Piłsudski would remain one of the most important PPS leaders up to the outbreak of the First World War.;Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 131.;

Piłsudski anticipated a coming European war;;Joseph Rothschild, ''East Central Europe Between the Two World Wars'', University of Washington Press, 1990, ISBN 0295953578, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ytc-muwFT_IC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Pilsudski+anticipated+war&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=WzB0R-_AFpjSigGyjOCIAg&amp;sig=GmHznLgdZljDVVJRjbplooWSJ0w Google Book Search, p. 45].; and the need to organize the nucleus of a future Polish Army which could help win Poland's independence from the three empires that had partitioned her out of political existence in the late 18th century. In 1906, Piłsudski, with the connivance of Austrian authorities, founded a military school in Kraków for the training of paramilitary units.; In 1906 alone, the 800-strong paramilitaries, operating in five-man teams in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; in subsequent years, the number of their casualties declined, while the paramilitaries' numbers increased to some 2,000 in 1908.;Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', pp. 121–22.;;

The paramilitaries also held up Russian currency transports leaving Polish territories. On the night of September 26–27, 1908, they robbed a Russian mail train carrying tax revenues from Warsaw to St. Petersburg.; Piłsudski, who took part in this Bezdany raid near Vilna, used the funds thus &quot;expropriated&quot; to fund his secret military organization;. The take from that single raid (200,812 rubles) was a fortune for the time and equaled the paramilitaries' entire takes of the two preceding years.;

In 1908, Piłsudski transformed his paramilitary units into an Association for Active Struggle (''Związek Walki Czynnej'', or ZWC), headed by three of his associates, Władysław Sikorski, Marian Kukiel and Kazimierz Sosnkowski.; One of the ZWC's main purposes was to train officers and noncommissioned officers for a future Polish Army.;

In 1910, two legal paramilitary organizations were created in the Austrian zone of Poland&amp;mdash;one in Lwów and one in Kraków&amp;mdash;to conduct training in military science. With the permission of the Austrian authorities he founded a series of &quot;sporting clubs,&quot; then the Związek Strzelecki|Riflemen's Association, which served as cover for training a Polish military force. In 1912, Piłsudski (using the ''nom de guerre'', &quot;''Mieczysław''&quot;) became the Commander-in-Chief of a Riflemen's Association (''Związek Strzelecki'') that grew by 1914 to 12,000 men.;; In 1914, Piłsudski declared that &quot;only the sword now carries any weight in the balance for the destiny of a nation.&quot;;

=World War I=
Piłsudski in uniform

At a meeting in Paris in 1914, Piłsudski presciently declared that in the imminent war, for Poland to regain her independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by France, Britain and the United States.;Hans Roos, ''A History of Modern Poland, from the Foundation of the State in the First World War to the Present Day'', Alfred A. Knopf, 1966., p. 14. Translated by J.R. Foster from the German ''Geschichte der polnischen Nation, 1916–1960''.;; By contrast, Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's rival, believed the best way to achieve a unified and independent Poland was to support the Triple Entente against the Triple Alliance.;Zamoyski, op cit, p. 333.;
Piłsudski in World War I (1914)
At the outbreak of World War I, on August 3, in Kraków, Piłsudski formed a small cadre military unit, the First Cadre Company, from members of the Riflemen's Association and Polish Rifle Squads.;Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 171–172.;; [http://www.polityka.pl/polityka/index.jsp?place=Lead30&amp;news_cat_id=1409&amp;news_id=193189&amp;layout=16&amp;forum_id=6303&amp;fpage=Threads&amp;page=text Przemówienie do I kompanii kadrowej, Kraków, Oleandry, 3 sierpnia 1914]. Polityka, 26 September 2006.; That same day, a cavalry unit under Władysław Belina-Prażmowski was sent to scout across the Russian border, even before the official declaration of war between Austro-Hungary and Russia, which ensued on August 6.;Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 168.;

Piłsudski's strategy was to send his forces north across the border into Russian Poland, into an area which the Russian Army had evacuated, in the hope of breaking through to Warsaw and sparking a national uprising.;;[http://web.ku.edu/~eceurope/hist557/lect11.htm The rebirth of Poland], University of Kansas, lecture notes by Prof. Anna M. Cienciala, 2004. Last accessed on 2 June 2006.; Using his limited forces, in those early days he backed his orders with the sanction of a fictitious &quot;National Government in Warsaw,&quot;;Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 174–175.; and bent and stretched Austrian orders to the utmost, taking initiatives, moving forward and establishing Polish institutions in liberated towns, while the Austrians saw his forces as good only for scouting or for supporting main Austrian formations.;Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', pp. 178–79.; On August 12, 1914, Piłsudski's forces took the town of Kielce, capital of Kielce Governorate, but Piłsudski found the populace less supportive than he had expected.;Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', pp. 170–71 and 180–82.;

Soon afterward he officially established the Polish Legions, taking personal command of their First Brigade,; which he would lead successfully into several victorious battles.; He also secretly informed the British government in the fall of 1914 that his Legions would never fight France or Britain, only Russia.;
Piłsudski and his officers, 1915
Piłsudski decreed that Legions personnel were to be addressed by the French-Revolution-inspired &quot;Citizen&quot; (''Obywatel''), and he himself was referred to as &quot;the Commandant&quot; (&quot;''Komendant''&quot;).;Zamoyski, ''op. cit'', p. 333.; Piłsudski enjoyed extreme respect and loyalty from his men; which would remain for years to come. The Polish Legions fought against Russia at the side of the Central Powers until 1917.

Soon after forming the Legions, also in 1914, Piłsudski set up another organization, the Polish Military Organisation (''Polska Organizacja Wojskowa''), which served as a precursor Polish intelligence agency and was designed to perform espionage and sabotage missions.;;

In mid-1916, after the Battle of Kostiuchnówka (July 4&amp;ndash;6, 1916), where the Polish Legions delayed a Russian offensive at a cost of over 2,000 casualties,; ''Bitwa pod Kostiuchnówką'', Zwycięstwa Oręża Polskiego Nr 16. Rzeczpospolita and Mówią Wieki. Various authors and editors. 17 June 2006 p. 12.; Piłsudski demanded that the Central Powers issue a guarantee of independence for Poland. He backed this demand with his own proffered resignation and that of many of the Legions' officers.;Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', pp. 251–52.; On November 5, 1916, the Central Powers proclaimed the &quot;independence&quot; of Poland, hoping to increase the number of Polish troops that could be sent to the eastern front against Russia, thereby relieving German forces to bolster the western front.;Mieczysław B.

Piłsudski agreed to serve in the &quot;Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918)|Kingdom of Poland&quot; created by the Central Powers, and acted as minister of war in the newly formed Polish Regency government.; In the wake of the Russian Revolution and in view of the worsening situation of the Central Powers, Piłsudski took an increasingly uncompromising stance, insisting that his men not be treated as &quot;German colonial troops&quot; and only be used to fight Russia. Anticipating the Central Powers' defeat in the war, he did not wish to be allied with the losing side.;Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', p. 253.;; In the aftermath of a July 1917 &quot;Oath Crisis&quot; when Piłsudski forbade Polish soldiers to swear an oath of loyalty to the Central Powers, he was arrested and imprisoned at Magdeburg; the Polish units were disbanded, and the men were incorporated into the Austro-Hungarian Army,;; while the Polish Military Organization began attacking German targets.; Piłsudski's arrest greatly enhanced his reputation among Poles, many of whom began to see him as the most determined Polish leader, willing to take on ''all'' the partitioning powers.;

On November 8, 1918, Piłsudski and his comrade, Colonel Kazimierz Sosnkowski, were released from Magdeburg and soon—like Vladimir Lenin before them—placed on a private train, bound for their national capital, as the increasingly desperate Germans hoped that Piłsudski would gather forces friendly to them.;

=Rebuilding Poland=
''Ulica Mokotowska 50'', Warsaw, where Piłsudski stayed November 13–29, 1918, after release from Magdeburg
On November 11, 1918, in Warsaw, Piłsudski was appointed Commander in Chief of Polish forces by the Regency Council and was entrusted with creating a national government for the newly independent country; on that day (which would become Poland's Independence Day), he proclaimed an independent Polish state.; In that week he also negotiated the evacuation of the German garrison from Warsaw and of other German troops from the &quot;Ober Ost&quot; authority; over 55,000 Germans would peacefully depart Poland afterwards, leaving their weapons to the Poles; over 400,000 total would depart Polish territories in coming months.;;Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 256 and 277–278.; On November 14, 1918, he was asked to provisionally supervise the running of the country. On November 22 he officially received, from the new government of Jędrzej Moraczewski, the title of Provisional Chief of State (''Naczelnik Państwa'') of renascent Poland.;

Various Polish military organizations and provisional governments (the Regency Council in Warsaw, the government of Ignacy Daszyński in Lublin, and the Polish Liquidation Committee in Kraków) bowed to Piłsudski, who set about forming a new coalition government. It was predominantly socialist and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the Polish Socialist Party, such as the eight-hour day, free school education, and women's suffrage. This was necessary to avoid major unrest. However, Piłsudski believed that as head of state he must be above political parties.;; The day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him socialist-style as &quot;Comrade&quot; (&quot;''Towarzysz''&quot;) and asked his support of their revolutionary policies; he refused it and answered: &quot;Comrades, I took the red tram of socialism to the stop called Independence, and that's where I got off.

In the days immediately after World War I, Piłsudski attempted to build a government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%.;MacMillan, op cit, p. 210.; A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported, &quot;I have nowhere seen anything like the evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn&quot;.; In addition, the country had to unify the different systems of law, economics, and administration in the former German, Austrian and Russian partitions of Poland into one; there were nine legal systems, five currencies, 66 types of rail systems (with 165 models of locomotives), and other similar problems, which all had to be urgently consolidated.;

Wacław Jędrzejewicz, in ''Piłsudski: A Life for Poland'', describes Piłsudski as very deliberate in his decision-making. He collected all available pertinent information, then took his time weighing it before arriving at a final decision. Piłsudski drove himself hard, working all day and, on a regimen of tea and chain-smoked cigarettes, all night.; He maintained a spartan lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant, and became increasingly pale and thin.; Though Piłsudski was popular with much of the Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work), of a man who distrusted almost everyone, led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.;

Piłsudski and the first Polish government were distrusted in the West because Piłsudski had cooperated with the Central Powers in 1914–17 and because the governments of Daszyński and Jędrzej Moraczewski were primarily socialist.; It was not until January 1919, when the world-famous pianist and composer Ignacy Paderewski became prime minister and foreign minister of a new government, that it was recognized in the West.; That still left two separate governments claiming to be Poland's legitimate government: Piłsudski's in Warsaw, and Dmowski's in Paris.; To ensure that Poland had a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Piłsudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Piłsudski acting as provisional president and supreme commander-in-chief while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the Paris Peace Conference.;MacMillan, ''op. cit.'', pp. 213–14.; Articles 87–93 of the Versailles Treaty;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/partiii.htm See Articles 87–93 of the Treaty].; and the Little Treaty of Versailles, signed on June 28, 1919, formally established Poland as a sovereign and independent state on the international arena.;Thomas D.

Piłsudski often clashed with Dmowski, at variance with the latter's vision of the Poles as the dominant nationality in renascent Poland, and irked by Dmowski's attempt to send the Blue Army to Poland through Gdańsk|Danzig, Germany (now Gdańsk, Poland).;MacMillan, ''op. cit.'', pp. 211 and 214.;;Manfred F.

On February 20, 1919, Piłsudski declared that he would return his powers to the newly elected Polish parliament (''Sejm''). However, the ''Sejm'' reinstated his office in the Little Constitution of 1919. The word &quot;Provisional&quot; was struck from his title, and Piłsudski would hold the office until December 9, 1922, when Gabriel Narutowicz was elected the first president of Poland.;

Piłsudski's major foreign-policy initiative at this time was a proposed federation (to be called &quot;''Międzymorze'',&quot; Polish for &quot;Between-Seas,&quot; and also known from the Latin as &quot;''Intermarum'',&quot; stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea) of Poland with the independent Baltic states and Belarus and Ukraine,; somewhat in emulation of the pre-partition Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. ; 

Piłsudski's plan met with opposition from most of the prospective member states—who refused to relinquish any of their hard-won independence—as well as from the Allied powers, for whom it would be too bold a change to the existing balance-of-power structure.;Robert Szymczak,

Instead of a Central- and East-European alliance, there soon appeared a series of border conflicts, including the Polish-Ukrainian War (1918–19), the Polish-Lithuanian War (1920, culminating in Żeligowski's Mutiny), Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts (beginning in 1918), and most notably the Polish-Soviet War (1919–21).; Winston Churchill commented: &quot;The war of giants has ended, the wars of the pygmies begin.&quot;;Adrian Hyde-Price, ''Germany and European Order'', Manchester University Press, 2001, ISBN 0-7190-5428-1 [http://books.google.com/books?id=M-2Obqk-VZUC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;sig=DUUDt60sddDtfNR-_h3dt41z5x4 Google Book Search, p. 75].;

=Polish-Soviet War=

Piłsudski in Poznań
In the aftermath of World War I, there was unrest on all Polish borders. Regarding Poland's future frontiers, Piłsudski said, &quot;All that we can gain in the west depends on the Entente—on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany&quot;, while in the east &quot;there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far.&quot;;MacMillan, op. cit., p. 211.; In 1918 in the east, Polish forces clashed with Ukrainian forces in the Polish-Ukrainian War, and Piłsudski's first orders as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, on 12 November 1918, were to provide support for the Battle of Lwów (1918)|Polish struggle in Lwów.;Urbankowski, op. cit., p. 281.; 

However, while Ukrainians were the first clear enemy, it soon became apparent that the various Ukrainian factions were not the real power in that region. Coming months and years would show that the Bolsheviks were in fact the most dangerous enemy not only of renascent Poland, but of the Ukrainians.

Piłsudski was aware that the Bolsheviks were no friends of independent Poland, and that war with them was inevitable.;Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 90 (second tome).; He viewed their advance west as a major problem, but also considered the Bolsheviks less dangerous for Poland than their Russian-civil-war contenders.;Peter Kenez, ''A History of the Soviet Union from the Beginning to the End'', Cambridge University Press, 1999, ISBN 0521311985, [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0521311985&amp;id=aIY9qb6iIEcC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=%22Peace+of+Riga%22&amp;sig=DOZgge7R-dNB7KTNOVV_QWrE8KI Google Book Search, p. 37].; These &quot;White Russians&quot;—representative of the old Russian Empire—were willing to accept only limited independence for Poland, probably within borders similar to those of the former Congress Poland, and clearly objected to Ukrainian independence, which was crucial for Piłsudski's ''Intermarum'' project.; Bohdan Urbankowski, ''Józef Piłsudski: marzyciel i strateg'', (Józef Piłsudski: Dreamer and Strategist), Tom drugi (second volume), Wydawnictwo ALFA, Warsaw, 1997, ISBN 8370019145, p. 83.;

This was in contrast to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void.;Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 291.; Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire.;;Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 45 (second tome).; By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.;Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 92 (second tome).;

In March 1920, Piłsudski was made &quot;First Marshal of Poland.&quot;
In the wake of the Russian westward offensive of 1918–1919 and of a series of escalating battles which resulted in the Poles advancing eastward, on April 21, 1920, Marshal Piłsudski (as his rank had been since March 1920) signed a military alliance (the Treaty of Warsaw) with Ukrainian leader Symon Petliura to conduct joint operations against Soviet Russia. The goal of the Polish-Ukrainian treaty was to establish an independent Ukraine in alliance with Poland.;Davies, ''White Eagle...'', Polish edition, p. 99–103.; In return, Petliura gave up Ukrainian claims to eastern Galicia, for which he was denounced by eastern-Galician Ukrainian leaders.; 

The Polish and Ukrainian armies, under Piłsudski's command, launched a successful offensive against the Russian forces in Ukraine. On May 7, 1920, with remarkably little fighting, they captured Kiev.;Davies, Norman, ''White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919–20'', Pimlico, 2003, ISBN 0712606947.

On July 1, 1920, in view of the rapidly advancing Soviet offensive, Poland's parliament, the ''Sejm'', formed a Council for Defense of the Nation. It was chaired by Piłsudski and was to provide expeditious decision-making and temporarily supplant the fractious Sejm.;Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', pp. 341–46 and 357–58.; The National Democrats, however, contended that the string of Bolshevik victories had been Piłsudski's fault;Suleja, op.cit., p. 265.; and demanded that he resign; some even accused him of treason.;Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', pp. 341–46.; Their July 19 failure to carry a vote of no-confidence in the council led to Roman Dmowski's withdrawal from it.; On August 12 Piłsudski tendered his resignation to Prime Minister Wincenty Witos, offering to be the scapegoat if the military solution failed, but Witos refused to accept his resignation.; The Entente pressured Poland to surrender and enter into negotiations with the Bolsheviks. Piłsudski, however, was a staunch advocate of continuing the fight.; As Norman Davies noted, at that time, especially abroad, &quot;Piłsudski had nothing of his later prestige. As a pre-war revolutionary he led his party to splits and quarrels; as a general in the WWI he led his legions to internment and disbanding; as a marshal of the Polish Army he led it to Kiev and Vilnius, both now lost to Poles. He left the Polish Socialist Party and his Austro-German allies; refused to ally himself with Entente. In France and England he was considered a treasonous ally who leads Poland into destruction; in Russia he was seen as a false servant of the allies, who will lead imperialism to ruin. All - from Lenin to Lloyd George, from Pravda to Morning Star - considered him a military and political failure. In August 1920 all were in agreement that his catastrophic career will be crowned with the fall of Warsaw.&quot;;Davies, Norman, ''White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919–20'', Wydawnictwo Znak, 1997, ISBN 8370067611, p. 229.;

Yet over the next few weeks, Poland's risky, unconventional strategy at the August 1920 Battle of Warsaw halted the Soviet advance.; The Polish plan was developed by Piłsudski and others, including Tadeusz Rozwadowski.;John Erickson, ''The Soviet High Command: A Military-Political History, 1918–1941'', Routledge, ISBN 0714651788 [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0714651788&amp;id=rgkSxFpKmIsC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=Rozwadowski&amp;sig=su5WRVqT6chSv5mAxfGlK9reOvE Google Book Search, p. 95.]; Later, some supporters of Piłsudski would seek to portray him as the sole author of the Polish strategy, while opponents would seek to minimize his role.;''Conceptions of National History: Proceedings of Nobel Symposium 78'', Walter de Gruyter, 1994, ISBN 3110135043 [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN3110135043&amp;id=uIVvQoxIHQkC&amp;pg=PA230&amp;lpg=PA230&amp;dq=Tadeusz+Rozwadowski&amp;sig=f-l2avIzG75kde4WHBxeWatjRS0 Google Book Search, p. 230].; In the West for a long time a myth persisted that it was General Maxime Weygand of the French military mission to Poland who had saved Poland; modern scholars, however, are in agreement that Weygand's role was minimal at best.;; Janusz Szczepański, [http://www.mowiawieki.pl/artykul.html?id_artykul=404 KONTROWERSJE WOKÓŁ BITWY WARSZAWSKIEJ 1920 ROKU] (Controversies surrounding the Battle of Warsaw in 1920).

Piłsudski's plan called for Polish forces to withdraw across the Vistula River and defend the bridgeheads at Warsaw and on the Wieprz River, while some 25% of available divisions concentrated to the south for a strategic counter-offensive. The plan next required two armies under General Józef Haller de Hallenburg|Józef Haller, facing Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east, to hold their entrenched positions at all costs. At the same time, an army under General Władysław Sikorski was to strike north from outside Warsaw, cutting off Soviet forces that sought to envelope the Polish capital from that direction. The most important role, however, was assigned to a relatively small, approximately 20,000-man, newly assembled &quot;Reserve Army&quot; (also known as the &quot;Strike Group,&quot; &quot;''Grupa Uderzeniowa''&quot;), comprising the most determined, battle-hardened Polish units and commanded personally by Piłsudski. Their task was to spearhead a lightning northward offensive, from the Vistula-Wieprz triangle south of Warsaw, through a weak spot identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern Fronts. That offensive would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually, the gap between Sikorski's army and the &quot;Strike Group&quot; would close near the East Prussian border, bringing about the destruction of the encircled Soviet forces.;Janusz Cisek, ''Kosciuszko, We Are Here: American Pilots of the Kosciuszko Squadron in Defense of Poland, 1919–1921'', McFarland &amp; Company, 2002, ISBN 0786412402, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0786412402&amp;id=hNuGZOGk6UoC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;q=Rozwadowski&amp;vq=Rozwadowski&amp;dq=Rozwadowski&amp;sig=Gzm5trogxhMjygu0qBKsACesExw Google Book Search, pp. 140–41].;;Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', pp. 346–441 and 357–58.;

At the time, Piłsudski's plan was strongly criticized, and only the desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders to go along with it. Though based on reliable intelligence, including decrypted Soviet radio communications, the plan was termed &quot;amateurish&quot; by high-ranking army officers and military experts who were quick to point out Piłsudski's lack of formal military education. When a copy of the plan fell into Soviet hands, Soviet commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky thought it a ruse and disregarded it.;; Days later, the Soviets paid dearly for this when, during the Battle of Warsaw, the overconfident Red Army suffered one of its greatest defeats ever.;;

Two days later, on December 16, 1922, Narutowicz was shot dead by a mentally deranged, right-wing, anti-Semitic painter and art critic, Eligiusz Niewiadomski, who had originally wanted to kill Piłsudski but had changed his target, influenced byright-wing National-Democrat anti-Narutowicz propaganda.;Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 489.; 

For Piłsudski this was a major shock, an event that shook his belief that Poland could function as a democracy;Suleja, op.cit., p. 300.; and made him favor government by a strong hand.;Norman Davies.

Stanisław Wojciechowski of ''PSL Piast'', another of Piłsudski's old colleagues, was elected the new president, and Wincenty Witos, also of ''PSL Piast'', became prime minister. But the new government—pursuant to the Lanckorona Pact, an alliance among the centrist ''PSL Piast'' and the right-wing National Populist Union and Polskie Stronnictwo Chrześcijańskiej Demokracji|Christian Democrat parties—contained right-wing enemies of Piłsudski, people whom he held morally responsible for Narutowicz's death and whom he found it impossible to work with.;Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 490–491.; On May 30, 1923, Piłsudski resigned as Chief of the General Staff. 

After General Stanisław Szeptycki proposed that the military should be more closely supervised by civilian authorities, Piłsudski criticized this as an attempt to politicize the army, and on June 28 he resigned his last political appointment. The same day, the Sejm's left-wing deputies voted a resolution thanking him for his past work.;Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 490.; Piłsudski went into retirement in Sulejówek, outside Warsaw, at his modest country cottage which had been presented to him by his former soldiers.;Richard M.

Meanwhile Poland's economy was in shambles. Hyperinflation fueled public unrest, and the government was unable to find a quick solution to the mounting unemployment and economic crisis.;Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 502.; Piłsudski's allies and supporters repeatedly asked him to return to politics, and he began to create a new power base, centered around former members of the Polish Legions and the Polish Military Organization as well as some left-wing and intelligentsia parties. In 1925, after several governments had resigned in short order and the political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic, Piłsudski became more and more critical of the government, eventually issuing statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet.;; 

When the Chjeno-Piast coalition, which Piłsudski had strongly criticized, formed a new government,; on May 12–14, 1926, Piłsudski returned to power in a ''coup d'état'' (the May Coup), supported by the Polish Socialist Party, Liberation, the Stronnictwo Chłopskie|Peasant Party, and even the Polish Communist Party.;Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 515.; Piłsudski had hoped for a bloodless coup, but the government had refused to back down;;Suleja, op.cit., p. 343.;215 soldiers and 164 civilians had been killed, and over 900 persons had been wounded.; Wojciech Roszkowski Historia Polski 1914–1991, Warszawa, 1992 ISBN 83-01-11014-7, pg 53 section 5.1.; 

On May 31, the ''Sejm'' elected Piłsudski president of the Republic.Piłsudski, however, aware of the presidency's limited powers, refused the office. Another of his old friends, Ignacy Mościcki, was elected in his stead. Piłsudski's formal offices—apart from two terms as prime minister in 1926–28 and 1930—would for the most part remain limited to those of minister of defense and inspector-general of the Polish Armed Forces. He also served as minister of military affairs and chairman of the war council.;

Piłsudski had no plans for major reforms; he quickly distanced himself from the most radical of his left-wing supporters, declaring that his coup was to be a &quot;revolution without revolutionary consequences.&quot;; His goals were to stabilize the country, reduce the influence of political parties, which he blamed for corruption and inefficiency, and strengthen the army.;Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 528–529.;;

Internal politics
Belweder Palace, Warsaw, Piłsudski's official residence during his years in power

In internal politics, Piłsudski's coup entailed sweeping limitations on parliamentary government, as his Sanation regime (1926–1939)—at times employing authoritarian methods—sought to &quot;restore public life to moral health.&quot; From 1928, the Sanation authorities were represented in the sphere of practical politics by the Non-partisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government (''BBWR''). Popular support and an effective propaganda apparatus allowed Piłsudski to maintain his authoritarian powers, which could not be overruled by the president, who was appointed by Piłsudski, not by the ''Sejm''.; The powers of the ''Sejm'' were curtailed by constitutional amendments introduced soon after the coup, on August 2, 1926.; From 1926 to 1930, Piłsudski relied chiefly on propaganda to weaken the influence of opposition leaders.; The culmination of his dictatorial and supralegal policies came in 1930 with the imprisonment and trial of certain political opponents on the eve of the 1930 Polish legislative elections, and with the 1934 establishment of a prison for political prisoners at Bereza Kartuska (today Biaroza),; where some prisoners were brutally mistreated.; Wojciech Śleszyński, [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://kamunikat.net.iig.pl/www/czasopisy/bzh/20/15.htm Aspekty prawne utworzenia obozu odosobnienia w Berezie Kartuskiej i reakcje środowisk politycznych.

Piłsudski became increasingly disillusioned with democracy in Poland.;Yohanan Cohen, ''Small Nations in Times of Crisis and Confrontation'', SUNY Press, 1989, ISBN 0791400182 [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0791400182&amp;id=aN96TB0RUB8C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=Pilsudski+hero&amp;sig=R2BZgP-C0yJ9fPlugHuXsGYLvrU Google Book Search, p. 65].; His intemperate public utterances – he called the ''Sejm'' a prostitute – and his sending 90 armed officers into the ''Sejm'' building in response to an impending vote of no-confidence, caused concern in contemporary observers, who saw his actions as a precedent for authoritarian responses to political challenges.;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,787573,00.html &quot;Pilsudski Bros.&quot;], ''Time'', April 07, 1930.;;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,737985,00.html Pilsudski v.

Nonetheless, Piłsudski's government depended more on his charismatic authority than on rational-legal authority.; None of his followers could claim to be his legitimate heir, and after his death the Sanation structure would quickly fracture, with Poland returning to the pre-Piłsudski era of parliamentary political contention.;

Piłsudski's regime began a period of national stabilization and improvements in the situation of ethnic minorities, which formed about a third of the Second Republic's population.;;Peter D.

Troubles followed the suppression of eastern Galicia, in which nearly 1,800 people were arrested. Tension also arose between the government and the German minority, particularly in Upper Silesia. The government did not give way to calls for antisemitic measures; but the Jews grew discontented for economic reasons connected to the depression. Overall, by the end of Pilsudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.;Leslie, R. F., ''The History of Poland Since 1863.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983, p. 182. ISBN 0521275016.;

In the military sphere, Piłsudski, who had shown himself an accomplished military strategist in engineering the &quot;Miracle at the Vistula,&quot; has been criticized by some for subsequently concentrating on personnel management and allegedly neglecting modernization of military strategy and equipment.;;Andrzej Garlicki, ''Jozef Pilsudski. 1867–1935''. Scolar Press, 1995, ISBN 1859280188, p. 178.; His experiences in the Polish-Soviet War (1919–21) may have led him to overestimate the importance of cavalry and to neglect the development of armored forces and air force.; Others, however, contend that, particularly from the late 1920s, he did support the development of those military branches.;Urbankowski, op.cit., vol.2, p. 30–337.; The limitations on Poland's military modernization in this period may have been less doctrinal than financial.

Foreign policy
Marshal Piłsudski, painted by Wojciech Kossak, 1928.
Under Piłsudski, Poland maintained good relations with neighboring Romania, Hungary and Latvia.Relations were strained with Czechoslovakia, however, and were still worse with Lithuania.;Erik Goldstein, ''The First World War Peace Settlements, 1919-1925'', Pearson Education, 2002, ISBN 0582311454, [http://books.google.com/books?id=H5WzZoCYAjoC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;vq=%22Poland+also+fought+a+war+with+Lithuania%22+%22the+struggle+with+Czechoslovakia%22&amp;dq=Poland+Lithuania+Czechoslovakia+World+War+Pilsudski&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=oth2u2gZVp8EQRB0s1tHRKPL8lQ Google Book Search, p. 29].; Relations with Weimar Germany and the Soviet Union varied over time, but during Piłsudski's tenure could for the most part be described as neutral.;Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 538.;;;

Piłsudski's Promethean program, designed to weaken the Russian Empire and its successor state, the Soviet Union, by supporting nationalist independence movements of major non-Russian peoples dwelling in Russia and the Soviet Union, was coordinated from 1927 to the 1939 outbreak of World War II in Europe by the military intelligence officer,Edmund Charaszkiewicz. In the Interbellum, the Prometheist movement yielded few tangible results.; Edmund Charaszkiewicz, ''Zbiór dokumentów ppłk.

''9)'', Kraków, Księgarnia Akademicka, 2000, ISBN 83-7188-449-4, pp. 56–87 ''et passim.'';

Piłsudski, as Charles de Gaulle was later to do in France, sought to maintain his country's independence in the international arena. Assisted by his protégé, Foreign Minister Józef Beck, he sought support for Poland in alliances with western powers such as France and the United Kingdom, and with friendly, if less powerful, neighbors such as Romania and Hungary.; 

A supporter of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the Polish-Romanian Alliance (part of the Little Entente), Piłsudski was disappointed by the French and British policy of appeasement evident in those countries' signing of the Locarno Treaties.;Ilya Prizel, ''National Identity and Foreign Policy: Nationalism and Leadership in Poland, Russia and Ukraine'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, ISBN 0521576970, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521576970&amp;id=fE2quB852jcC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=Pilsudski+wealth&amp;sig=MmY_fMN0nBIs5qFavD_godqa-0Q Google Book Search, p. 71].;;John Lukacs, '' The Last European War: September 1939-December 1941'', Yale University Press, 2001, ISBN 0300089155 [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300089155&amp;id=5wktT0vEYgkC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=Pilsudski+France+1933&amp;sig=Lp1a7st1SGuMJfKpvFWzLqOtm0w Google Book Search, p. 30].;;Nicole Jordan, ''The Popular Front and Central Europe: The Dilemmas of French Impotence 1918–1940'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, ISBN 0521522420, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521522420&amp;id=4iQQrESpA48C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Pilsudski+France+1933&amp;sig=La39fTfAVC8dXNTUcbufCrapDTk Google Book Search, p. 23].; Piłsudski therefore aimed also to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union and Germany; hence Poland signed non-aggression pacts with both its powerful neighbors: the 1932 Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact.; The two treaties were meant to strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbors.;

After Adolf Hitler came to power in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have proposed to France a preventive war against Germany.It has been argued that Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany, which had been openly rearming in violation of the Versailles Treaty.;Urbankowski, op.cit., vol.2, p. 317–326.; French disinterest may have been a reason why Poland signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934.;Tomasz Torbus, ''Nelles Guide Poland'', Hunter Publishing, Inc, 1999, ISBN 3886180883 [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN3886180883&amp;id=xH6iEYILvuYC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=Pilsudski+France+1933&amp;sig=hV7b1WHEJzrnGCt0vGkG_Bp_OtM Google Book Search, p. 25].;;George H.

Hitler repeatedly suggested a German-Polish alliance against the Soviet Union, but Piłsudski declined, instead seeking precious time to prepare for potential war with Germany or with the Soviet Union.;;Klaus Hildebrand, ''The Foreign Policy of the Third Reich'', University of California Press, 1973, ISBN 0520025288 [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520025288&amp;id=bJWegl8wnF8C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=Pilsudski+France+1933&amp;sig=2AztWI0oGOImsxOscknyLP4GdJ8 Google Book Search, p. 33].; Hitler also kept hoping to meet personally with Piłsudski, butagain was rebuffed.; 

Just before his death, Piłsudski told Józef Beck that it must be Poland's policy to maintain neutral relations with Germany and keep up the Polish alliance with France, and to improve relations with the United Kingdom.;

Grave of Piłsudski's mother in Vilnius, Lithuania. The huge black tombstone is inscribed: &quot;''Matka i serce syna''&quot;; (&quot;A mother and the heart of her son&quot;) and bears evocative lines from a poem by Juliusz Słowacki|Słowacki.
By 1935, unbeknown to the public, Piłsudski had for several years been in declining health. On May 12, 1935, he died of liver cancer at Warsaw's Belweder Palace. The celebration of his life had begun spontaneously within half an hour after his death had been announced.;Zbigniew Wojcik, ''Przedmowa'', in Marian Marek Drozdowski, Hanna Szwankowska, ''Pożegnanie Marszałka: antologia tekstów historycznych i literackich'', Oficyna Wydawnicza &quot;Typografika&quot;, 1995, ISBN 8386417188, p. 5.; It was led by military personnel—former Legionnaires, members of the Polish Military Organization, veterans of the wars of 1919–21, and his political collaborators from his time as Naczelnik Państwa|Chief of State and, later, prime minister.;Marian Marek Drozdowski, ''Przedmowa'', in Marian Marek Drozdowski, Hanna Szwankowska, ''Pożegnanie Marszałka: antologia tekstów historycznych i literackich'', Oficyna Wydawnicza &quot;Typografika&quot;, 1995, ISBN 8386417188, pp. 9–11.;

The Polish Communist Party immediately attacked Piłsudski as a fascist and capitalist.; Other opponents of the Sanation regime, however, were more civil; socialists (such as Ignacy Daszyński and Tomasz Arciszewski) and Christian Democrats (represented by Ignacy Paderewski, Stanisław Wojciechowski and Władysław Grabski) expressed condolences. The peasant parties split in their reactions (Wincenty Witos voicing criticism of Piłsudski, but Maciej Rataj and Stanisław Thugutt being supportive), while Roman Dmowski's National Democrats expressed a toned-down criticism.;

Condolences were expressed by Polish Catholic clergy—by Poland's Primate August Hlond—as well as by Pope Pius XI, who called himself a &quot;personal friend&quot; of the Marshal.; Notable appreciation for Piłsudski was expressed by Poland's ethnic and religious minorities. Eastern Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Protestant, Judaic and Islamic organizations expressed condolences, praising Piłsudski for his policies of religious tolerance.; Mainstream organizations of ethnic minorities similarly expressed their support for his policies of ethnic tolerance, though he was criticized, similarly to the communists, by Jewish (BUND), Ukrainian, German and Lithuanian extremists.;

On the international scene, Pope Pius XI held a special ceremony May 18 in the Holy See, a commemoration was conducted at League of Nations Geneva headquarters, and dozens of messages of condolence arrived in Poland from heads of state across the world, including Germany's Adolf Hitler, the Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin, Italy's Benito Mussolini and King Victor Emmanuel III, France's Albert Lebrun and Pierre-Étienne Flandin, Austria's Wilhelm Miklas, Japan's Emperor Hirohito, and Britain's King George V.;

Ceremonies, masses and an enormous funeral were held; a funeral train toured Poland;Grace Humphrey, ''Pilsudski: Builder of Poland'', Scott and More, 1936, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BNkwAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Pi%C5%82sudski+%22funeral+train%22&amp;dq=Pi%C5%82sudski+%22funeral+train%22&amp;hl=pl&amp;pgis=1 Google Book Search, p. 295].;. After a two-year display at St. Leonard's Crypt in Kraków's Wawel Cathedral, Piłsudski's body was laid to rest in the Cathedral's Crypt under the Silver Bells, except for his brain, which he had willed for study to Stefan Batory University, and his heart, which was interred in his mother's grave at Vilnius' Rossa Cemetery, where it remains.;;;

Legacy


;
On May 13, 1935, in accordance with Piłsudski's last wishes, Edward Rydz-Śmigły was named by Poland's president and government to be Inspector-General of the Polish Armed Forces, and on November 10, 1936, he was elevated to Marshal of Poland.;Marek Jabłonowski, Piotr Stawecki, ''Następca komendanta. Edward Śmigły-Rydz. Materiały do biografii''. Wyższa Szkoła Humanistyczna w Pułtusku. 1998. ISBN 9390920808, p. 13.; Rydz was now one of the most powerful people in Poland—the &quot;second man in the state after the President.&quot;;''Następca...'', op.cit., p. 5.; While many saw Rydz-Śmigły as a successor to Piłsudski, he never became as influential.;''Następca...'', op.cit., p. 14.; 

As the Polish government became increasingly authoritarian and conservative, the Rydz-Śmigły faction was opposed by that of the more moderate Ignacy Mościcki, who remained President.; After 1938 Rydz-Śmigły reconciled with the President, but the ruling group remained divided into the &quot;President's Men,&quot; mostly civilians (the &quot;Castle Group,&quot; after the President's official residence, Warsaw's Royal Castle), and the &quot;Marshal's Men&quot; (&quot;Piłsudski's Colonels&quot;), professional military officers and old comrades-in-arms of Piłsudski's. After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, some of this political division would survive within the Polish government in exile.

Statue of Piłsudski on Warsaw's Piłsudski Square, one of many statuary tributes throughout Poland
Piłsudski had given Poland something akin to what Henryk Sienkiewicz's Onufry Zagłoba had mused about: a Polish Oliver Cromwell. As such, the Marshal had inevitably drawn both intense loyalty and intense vilification.;;Jeffrey C. Goldfarb, ''Beyond Glasnost: The Post-Totalitarian Mind'', University of Chicago Press, 1992, ISBN 0226300986, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0226300986&amp;id=7aHEDQ0HbyIC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=Pilsudski+hero&amp;sig=HyAJCU-pvFO3L3CYoCtisFxjflc Google Book Search, p. 152].;;Zbigniew Wojcik, ''Przedmowa'', in Marian Marek Drozdowski, Hanna Szwankowska, ''Pożegnanie Marszałka: antologia tekstów historycznych i literackich'', Oficyna Wydawnicza &quot;Typografika&quot;, 1995, ISBN 8386417188, p. 6.;

In 1935, at Piłsudski's funeral, President Mościcki had eulogized the Marshal: &quot;He was the king of our hearts and the sovereign of our will. During a half-century of his life’s travails, he captured heart after heart, soul after soul, until he had drawn the whole of Poland within the purple of his royal spirit... He gave Poland freedom, boundaries, power and respect.&quot;;Translation of Mościcki's speech from 1935. For Polish original online, see Piotr M. Kobos, ''[http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje43/text02p.htm SKAZUJĘ WAS NA WIELKOŚĆ: Legenda Józefa Piłsudskiego]'', Nr 2 (43), September 2005.;

After World War II, little of Piłsudski's thought influenced the policies of the Polish People's Republic, a ''de facto'' satellite of the Soviet Union.In particular, Poland was in no position to resume Piłsudski's mutually complementary strategies for ensuring Poland's national security:the effort to build an Międzymorze|''Intermarum''federation of Poland and some of its neighbors; and a &quot;Promethean&quot; endeavor to &quot;break up the Russian state into its main constituents and emancipat[e] the countries that have been forcibly incorporated into that empire.&quot;;Quoted in Charaszkiewicz, 2000, p. 56.;

For a decade after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or condemned by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar Second Polish Republic. This began to change, however, particularly after destalinization and the Polish October (1956), and Polish historiography gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.;Władysław Władyka, ''Z Drugą Rzeczpospolitą na plecach. Postać Józefa Piłsudskiego w prasie i propagandzie PRL do 1980 roku.'' in Marek Jabłonowski, Elżbieta Kossewska, eds., ''Piłsudski na łamach i w opiniach prasy polskiej 1918–1989'' (Piłsudski As Seen in the Polish Press, 1918–1989), Oficyna Wydawnicza ASPRA-JR and Warsaw University, 2005, ISBN 8389964449 pp. 285–311; and Małgorzata and Mariusz Żuławnik, ''Powrót na łamy. Józef Piłsudski w prasie oficjalnej i podziemnej 1980–1989'' (Return to the Newspapers:Józef Piłsudski in the Official and Underground Press, 1980–1989), ibid.;

After the fall of communism and the 1991 disintegration of the Soviet Union, Piłsudski once again came to be publicly acknowledged as a Polish national hero.; On the sixtieth anniversary of his death, on May 12, 1995, Poland's ''Sejm'' adopted a resolution: &quot;Józef Piłsudski will remain, in our nation's memory, the founder of its independence and the victorious leader who fended off a foreign assault that threatened the whole of Europe and its civilization. Józef Piłsudski served his country well and has entered our history forever.&quot;;Translation of OŚWIADCZENIE SEJMU RZECZYPOSPOLITEJ POLSKIEJ z dnia 12 maja 1995 r. w sprawie uczczenia 60 rocznicy śmierci Marszałka Józefa Piłsudskiego.

While some of Piłsudski's political moves remain controversial—particularly the May 1926 Coup d'état, the establishment of the Bereza Kartuska detention camp, and successive Polish governments' failure to formulate consistent, constructive policies toward the national minorities;Charaszkiewicz, 2000, pp. 66–67.;—Piłsudski continues to be viewed by most Poles as a providential figure in the country's 20th-century history.

He was the subject of paintings by renowned artists such as Jacek Malczewski (1916) and (leaning on his sword, 1928; and astride his horse, ''Kasztanka'') Wojciech Kossak.

On Piłsudski's death in 1935, the Polish mint issued a silver 10-''złoty'' commemorative coin featuring the Marshal's rugged profile.

There are statues of Piłsudski in many Polish cities.The highest density of such statuary memorials is found in Warsaw, which has three over the span of little more than a mile joining the Belweder Palace, Piłsudski's residence, with Piłsudski Square.

Plans are being considered to turn Piłsudski's official residenc, the Belweder Palace, which currently houses a small exhibit about him, into a full-fledged museum devoted to his memory.

Family and names


The Piłsudski (family)|Piłsudskis date back to pagan times inLithuania and are recorded from the 13th century.; Wiesław Jan Wysocki, ''[http://archiwum2000.tripod.com/494/pilsud.html Konterfekt rodu Piłsudskich]'', Nasza Gazeta 5 (494).; Over time, along with other Lithuanian nobility, they became Polonized and joined the ranks of the ''szlachta'', the Polish nobility.;Wacław Jędrzejewicz, Janusz Cisek, ''Kalendarium Życia Józefa Piłsudskiego'', Zaklad Narodowy im. Ossolińskich, 1994, ISBN 8304041146, p. 11–12.;

The Piłsudski family has produced many notable members. Józef Piłsudski's closest and most prominentrelatives included his three brothers—Adam Piłsudski, a politician; Bronisław Piłsudski, a noted ethnographer; Jan Piłsudski, a lawyer and politician—and his daughter Wanda Piłsudska, who remained in England after World War II, practicing psychiatry, then in 1990 returned permanently to Poland, where she died in 2001.;;

Notes
a.Józef Klemens Piłsudski was commonly referred to without his middle name, as &quot;Józef Piłsudski.&quot; A few English sources translate his first name as &quot;Joseph,&quot; but this is not the common practice. As a young man, he belonged to underground organizations and used various pseudonyms, including &quot;''Wiktor'',&quot; &quot;''Mieczysław''&quot; and &quot;''Ziuk''&quot; (the latter also being his family nickname). Later he was often affectionately called &quot;''Dziadek''&quot; (&quot;Grandpa&quot; or &quot;the Old Man&quot;) and &quot;''Marszałek''&quot; (&quot;the Marshal&quot;). His ex-soldiers from the Legions also referred to him as &quot;''Komendant''&quot; (&quot;the Commandant&quot;).

b. Piłsudski sometimes spoke of being a Lithuanian of Polish culture.;Norman Davies, ''Heart of Europe: A Short History of Poland'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1984, ISBN 0-19-285152-7, p. 139.; The question of his ethnicity and culture is not a simple one. Timothy Snyder, who calls him a &quot;Polish-Lithuanian,&quot; notes that Piłsudski did not think in terms of 20th-century nationalisms and ethnicities; he considered himself ''both'' a Pole and a Lithuanian, and his homeland was the historic Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.; p. 70.; Discussing his role in Lithuania, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' describes him as a Polonized Lithuanian;;Encyclopædia Britannica Online. ''[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-460674/Jozef-Klemens-Pilsudski Józef Klemens Pilsudski (president of Poland): role in Lithuania: Baltic states. Lithuanian liberation]''. Accessed December 17, 2007.; however, in the introduction to his biography it simply calls him &quot;Polish.&quot;;Encyclopædia Britannica Online. ''[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9060041/Jozef-Pilsudski Józef Pilsudski]'' and Britannica Concise Encyclopedia [http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9375283/J%C3%B3zef-Pilsudski Pilsudski, Józef]''. Accessed December 17, 2007.; He is also described simply as &quot;Polish&quot; by the ''Columbia Encyclopedia'';The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Pilsudsk.html Joseph Piłsudski]. Accessed December 17, 2007.; and ''Encarta''.;Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007. [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761558833/Pilsudski.html#461528987 Józef Piłsudski].

Zbigniew Brzezinski, in his introduction to Wacław Jędrzejewicz’s ''Pilsudski: A Life for Poland'', writes: &quot;Some years before his death Pilsudski, in a statement which epitomises the essence of modern Polish history, stated: 'To be defeated and not yield is victory. To win and to rest on laurels is defeat.' [...] Pilsudski’s vision of Poland, paradoxically, was never attained. He contributed immensely to the creation of a modern Polish state, to the preservation of Poland from the Soviet invasion, yet he failed to create the kind of multinational commonwealth, based on principles of social justice and ethnic tolerance, to which he aspired in his youth. One may wonder how relevant was his image of such a Poland in the age of nationalism...&quot;;Wacław Jędrzejewicz, ''Pilsudski: A Life For Poland'', Hippocrene Books, 1991, ISBN 0870527479.;
