Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined. New York: Hyperion. ISBN 078688939X;

He continued on to college at Kent State University and was expelled twice for poor academic performance.He left KSU after just three years, but not before becoming a member of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity.After leaving the university, according to Ms Terry Heldreth, Carey joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve in 1980 and served for six years.; He also relocated to Las Vegas for a few months in 1982, and for a short time worked as a bank teller and a waiter at Denny's.;

He was first brought to the national eye as a comedian when he competed in the 1988 ''Star Search''.;; Carey was working as a stand-up comedian in 1991 when he appeared on ''The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson''.;; His performance that night impressed Carson, who invited Carey to the couch next to his desk; this was considered a rare honor for any comedian.;; Carey claims he reached the limit on his credit card the next day returning calls from interested casting directors and he credited Carson with making his career. In that same year, Carey also appeared on the ''14th Annual Young Comedians Special'' on HBO and made his first appearance on ''Late Night with David Letterman''.;;

In 1994, Carey wrote his own stand-up comedy special which aired on Showtime, entitled ''Drew Carey: Human Cartoon'', for which he won a CableACE Award for Best Writing.;

By the final season, he was earning $750,000 per episode.;; The show had high ratings for its first few seasons, but declining ratings and production costs of around $3 million per episode eventually resulted in its cancellation.;; The program had a total of 233 episodes and lasted from 1995 to 2004 for nine complete seasons.

Writing
Cover of ''Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined''
Carey has a history of writing throughout his career including developing his stand-up comedy routines in his early stand-up career, and then moving on to assist in writing sitcoms. In 1997, Carey published his autobiography, ''Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined'' where he shared memories of his early childhood and of his father's death when he was eight.

The book featured large amounts of profanity and, as the title suggests, includes multiple dirty jokes (there was one at the start of each chapter) and references to beer. The book was featured on the New York Times bestseller list for three months.;;

Personal life
A former United States Marine reservist, he adopted his crew cut hair style during his time in the service. Carey has had refractive surgery to correct his vision and therefore did not really require glasses (any glasses he wore in public were merely props to help the audience recognize him). However, while this was true for several years, on the May 17, 2006 episode of the ''Jimmy Kimmel Live'' show he revealed that when he turned 40, he actually developed a need for bifocals. Carey currently lives in Los Angeles and New York City.;;

On October 9, 2007 Carey proposed to Nicole Jaracz. In a statement regarding the engagement, publicist Christina Papadopoulos said, &quot;It will be the first marriage for both. No date for a wedding has been set yet. They are both very happy and excited about their future together.&quot;;;

=Emceeing Cleveland Football=
*Attended first game back of Cleveland Browns football against the Pittsburgh Steelers by reintroducing the Browns in front of a national televised audience (ESPN Sunday Night Football) in 1999.
*Played himself on the Drew Carey Show getting busted at a Browns game for streaking onto the field with a cameo appearance of Tim Couch in 1999.

=Political involvement=
Carey is also known for his Republican leanings;; and has expressed support for the Libertarian Party.;; ''The Drew Carey Show'' often presented a libertarian critique of political correctness, government regulations, racism, sexism, and homophobia, with storylines involving Carey's cross-dressing brother, dating a bisexual woman (played by Illeana Douglas) for two episodes, ongoing criticism of the Boy Scouts of America's exclusionary policy against gay men, and support for same-sex marriage.

Carey has spoken about his various political beliefs in several interviews and in 1998, he led a &quot;smoke-in&quot; in defiance of a no-smoking
ordinance.;;

In a guest appearance on ''Blue Collar TV'', he said (presumably tongue-in-cheek) &quot;That's why I vote Republican&quot; during one of the skits.

Since the show ended its nine-year run on ABC in 2004, however, Carey has clarified that he is more of a conservative with libertarian leanings, and that he presented himself as a libertarian to avoid what some conservative critics of the entertainment industry claim is a general Hollywood bias against conservatives. On the August 18, 2006 ''Penn Radio'' show with Penn Jillette, Carey did, however, say he was indeed libertarian. He has expressed his distaste for the George W. Bush administration|Bush administration's running of the War in Iraq, specifically on the September 15, 2007, episode of ''Real Time with Bill Maher''.

He was rewarded by the Cleveland Indians for being &quot;the greatest Indians fan alive&quot; with a personal bobblehead doll made in his likeness given to fans.;; Carey responded to his bobblehead likeness by saying &quot;Bobblehead Day, for me, is as big as getting a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame.&quot;;;

Carey also has played on the World Poker Tour in the Hollywood Home games for the Cleveland Public Library charity.;; In June 2007, Carey offered to donate up to $100,000 (in $10,000 increments) to the Mooch Myernick Memorial Fund if anybody could beat him at the video game FIFA Soccer 07 for the Xbox 360.
