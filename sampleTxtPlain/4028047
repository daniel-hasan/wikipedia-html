Background
Beeman was trained as a linguistic anthropologist at Wesleyan University and the University of Chicago. He gained fame through his extensive writing, having authored several books and more than 100 scholarly articles on communication dynamics in the United States, Iran, Japan and South Asia. His [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0253331390 ''Language, Status and Power in Iran''] has become a classic, as has his [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007B9HF6 ''Culture, Performance and Communication in Iran'']. His most recent work,[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0275982149/ ''The “Great Satan” vs. the “Mad Mullahs”: How the United States and Iran Demonize Each Other''], dealing with the negative discourse and rhetoric between Iran and the United States for the past 30 years has had enormous influence on national attitudes toward the Bush administration's attacks on Iran, and the possibility of military conflict between the two nations. 

An important aspect of his work has been the study of non-Western theatrical traditions, particularly the Iranian ritual passion drama, ''ta'ziyeh'' and the comic improvisatory theatre tradition, ''ru-howzi.'' His interest in the art world is also shown in his contribution to the co-authored volume [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0892361352 ''Object, Image and Inquiry: The Art Historian at Work'']. A compendium of his publications available for free download and his curriculum vitae can be accessed at his [http://www.williambeeman.com academic home page]. He has authored more than 500 opinion pieces and media essays, many of which can be found at his blog: [http://www.wbeeman.com Culture and International Affairs].

An admirer of the late anthropologist, Margaret Mead, Beeman has edited seven volumes of her post-World War II papers, having written scholarly introductions for several of them, including [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1571812164 ''The Study of Culture at a Distance''], and [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1571818162 ''Studying Contemporary Western Society: Method and Theory''].
