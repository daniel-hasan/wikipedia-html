Gillebríghde Albanach (fl. 1200-1230) was a medieval Scottish poet and crusader.He took part, along with his fellow-Gael Muireadhach Albanach, in the Fifth Crusade, reaching Acre in 1218 or 1219, and following the main Crusader army via southern Cyprus to Damietta;;Alan MacQuarrie, ''Scotland and the Crusades'', (Edinburgh, 1997), p. 38.; He may have been on crusade until 1224 or after.;Thomas Owen Clancy (ed.), ''The Triumph Tree: Scotland's Earliest Poetry, 550&amp;ndash;1350'', (Edinburgh, 1998), p. 247.; 

When not crusading, Gillebrìghde spent much, if not most of this life working as a poet in Ireland. His panegyric poems are all dedicated to Irish patrons. We know he was Scottish, however, because of references to Scotland describing it as &quot;duthchas damh&quot;, my dúthchas (&quot;native place&quot;, &quot;heritage&quot;, &quot;birthright&quot;, etc) and &quot;dom thír&quot;, my country.;Wilson MacLeod, ''Divided Gaels: Gaelic Cultural Identities in Scotland and Ireland, c. 1200-1650'', (Oxford, 2004), p. 88; About seven of his poems survive, five panegyric poems,;Actually, Dr. Wilson MacLeod, ''op. cit.'', p. 87, says &quot;Approxiamtely eight poem survive ... these include six panegyrics&quot;, but his lists only five of these.; and two crusading poems.;The details of the availability of all these poems (both panegyric and crusader) in print can be found in MacLeod, ''op. cit.'', p. 87, n. 109.;

=Panegyrics=
The surviving panegyrics were written for two Irish patrons, Donnchadh Cairbreach Ó Briain (d. 1242), King of Thomond; and Cathal Croibhdhearg Ó Conchubhair (d. 1224), King of Connaught.
