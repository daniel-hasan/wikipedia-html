In 1789, Ontario County was split off from Montgomery. The actual area split off fromMontgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne Counties.

= The formation of Otsego County= 
Otsego County was one of three counties split off from Montgomery (the other two being Herkimer, and Tioga County).Otsego county was officially established on February 16, 1791, with Cooperstown as its county seat, even though the village of Cherry Valley was at the time much larger.The original county consisted of three large townships:
*Cherry Valley in the northeast,
*Otsego in the northwest, and
*Harpersfield in the south.

Otsego and Cherry Valley together roughly covered the area of modern Otsego County, while Harpersfield covered the area south of the current county, as far as the Delaware River.

The original appointments to Otsego County government positions, made by Governor George Clinton included:
* Richard R. Smith, county sheriff, from the Otsego township,
* Jacob Morris, county clerk, from the Otsego township,
* William Cooper, chief judge, from the Otsego township,
* Jedediah Peck, associate justice from the Otsego township,
* Edward Griswold, associate justice from Cherry Valley
* Platt Townsend, associate justice from Harpersfield,
* Alexander Harper, commander of the county militia, from Harpersfield.

= The founding of new towns= 
By 1793, four towns had been added to the county by division of the existing towns:
*The Otsego township had been divided into the towns of:
**Burlington in the west,
**Otsego in the northeast,
**Richfield in the north, and
**Unadilla in the south.
*Harpersfield had been divided into the towns of:
**Franklin in the west and
**Harpersfield in the east.

= Areas of Otsego County used to form new counties= 
The area of Otesgo County was reduced by a number of subsequent splits.

In 1795, a piece of Otsego County was joined with a portion taken from Albany County to create Schoharie County.

In 1797, a piece of Otsego County was joined with a portion taken from Ulster County to create Delaware County.
