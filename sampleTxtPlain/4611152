&quot;A Little Too Late&quot; (2005) is a pop song written by Gary Barlow, Delta Goodrem and Eliot Kennedy, produced by True North Records for Goodrem's second album ''Mistaken Identity'' (2004). It was released as the albums fourth single in Australia on May 27, 2005 as a CD single.

The song was Goodrem's tenth single to chart on the ARIA Charts, peaking at number thirteen. It was Delta's first song since her 2001 single, I Don't Care to not enter the top ten. After its debut at number thirteen, the song fell down the charts, leaving the top twenty after two weeks, spending ten weeks in the top fifty and sixteen weeks in the top one hundred. The accompanying film clip was criticised by Channel V host, Yumi Stynes for &quot;resembling a tampon commercial&quot;.

In 2007, Goodrem commented on the Channel V special 'Hanging With: Delta Goodrem' that looking back on the video, she felt &quot;sick of it&quot; and &quot;didn't feel like&quot; herself. She also said that she was &quot;out of gas by the end of the whole thing&quot; and the she disliked the song and 'didn't know why she was singing it', implying that the positive track didn't relate to her.

The video was directed by Anthony Rose at Point Piper, Sydney, Australia.
