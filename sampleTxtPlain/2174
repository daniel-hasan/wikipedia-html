Arsenal Football Club(also known as Arsenal, The Arsenal or The Gunners) are an English professional association football club based in Holloway, north London.They play in the Premier League and are one of the Football records in England#Most successful clubs overall (1888 - present)|most successful clubs in English football, having won thirteen First Division and Premier League titles and ten FA Cups.

Arsenal were founded in 1886, though they won their first major trophies in the 1930s, with five League Championship titles and two FA Cups. After a lean period in the post-war years they became only the second club of the 20th century to win the Double in 1970-71 in English football|1970–71, and during the past twenty years they have been one of the most successful clubs in English football — in this time Arsenal won two further Doubles, the Premier League in 2003-04 in English football|2003–04 unbeaten, and in UEFA Champions League 2005-06|2005–06 became the first London club to reach the UEFA Champions League final.

The club's colours have traditionally been red and white, although these have evolved through history. Similarly, the club have changed location over time; the team were initially founded in Woolwich, south-east London, but in 1913 they moved north across the city to Arsenal Stadium, Highbury. In 2006 they made a less drastic move to their current home, the Emirates Stadium in nearby Holloway.

Arsenal have a large and diverse fanbase, who hold a string of long-standing rivalries with several other clubs; the most notable of these is with neighbours Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur, with whom they regularly contest the North London derby.Arsenal are one of the richest clubs in English football (worth over £600m as of 2007), and thanks to their stature, have regularly featured in portrayals of football in British culture. Arsenal L.F.C.|Arsenal Ladies are the most successful English club in women's football and are also affiliated with the club.

History

;
Arsenal were founded as Dial Square in 1886 by workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, but were renamed Royal Arsenal shortly afterwards. They renamed themselves again to Woolwich Arsenal after turning professional in 1891. The club joined the Football League in 1893, starting out in the Second Division, and won promotion to the First Division in 1904. However, the club's geographic isolation resulted in lower attendances than those of other clubs, which led to the club becoming mired in financial problems and effectively bankrupt by 1910, when they were taken over by Henry Norris.;; Norris sought to move the club elsewhere, and in 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Arsenal moved to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, North London; they dropped &quot;Woolwich&quot; from their name the following year.;; Arsenal only finished in fifth place in 1919, but nevertheless were elected to rejoin the First Division at the expense of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur, by reportedly dubious means.;It has been alleged that Arsenal's promotion, on historical grounds rather than merit, was thanks to underhand actions by the then Arsenal chairman, Sir Henry Norris; see History of Arsenal F.C. (1886–1966) for more details. These allegations range from political machinations to outright bribery; no firm proof of any wrongdoing has ever been found. A brief account is given inA more detailed account can be found in ;
The fact that Arsenal have not been relegated since makes them the only team currently in the top division whose status is not purely based on playing merit.

In 1925, Arsenal appointed Herbert Chapman as manager. Chapman had already won the league twice with Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town in 1923-24 in English football|1923–24 and 1924-25 in English football|1924–25, and he brought Arsenal their first period of major success. His revolutionary tactics and training, along with the signings of star players such as Alex James and Cliff Bastin, laid the foundations of the club's domination of English football in the 1930s. Under his guidance Arsenal won their first major trophies — an FA Cup in 1929-30 in English football|1929–30 and two League Championships, in 1930-31 in English football|1930–31 and 1932-33 in English football|1932–33. In addition, Chapman was reportedly behind the 1932 renaming of the local London Underground station from &quot;Gillespie Road&quot; to &quot;Arsenal&quot;, making it the only Tube station to be named specifically after a football club.;;

Chapman died suddenly of pneumonia in early 1934, but Joe Shaw and George Allison carried on his successful work. Under their guidance, Arsenal won three more titles (1933-34 in English football|1933–34, 1934-35 in English football|1934–35 and 1937-38 in English football|1937–38) and an FA Cup (1935-36 in English football|1935–36). However Arsenal had started to fade by the decade's end, when the intervention of World War II meant competitive professional football in England was suspended.

After the war, under Allison's successor Tom Whittaker, Arsenal enjoyed a second period of success, winning the league in 1947-48 in English football|1947–48 and 1952-53 in English football|1952–53, and the FA Cup in 1949-50 in English football|1949–50. However, after that their fortunes waned; unable to attract players of the same calibre as they had in the 1930s, the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in trophyless mediocrity. Even former England captain Billy Wright could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.

Arsenal began winning silverware again with the surprise appointment of club physiotherapist Bertie Mee as manager in 1966. After losing two League Cup finals, they won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, their first European trophy, in Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1969-70|1969–70. This was followed by an even greater triumph: their first League and FA Cup double in 1970-71 in English football|1970–71. However, the Double-winning side was soon broken up and the following decade was characterised by a series of near misses. Arsenal finished as First Division runners-up in 1972-73 in English football|1972–73, lost three FA Cup finals (1971-72 in English football|1971–72, 1977-78 in English football|1977–78 and 1979-80 in English football|1979–80) and lost the 1979–80 Cup Winners' Cup final on penalties. The club's only success during this time was an FA Cup win in 1978-79 in English football|1978–79, with a last-minute 3–2 victory over Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United that is widely regarded as a classic.;A 2005 poll of English football fans rated the 1979 FA Cup Final the 15th greatest game of all time. Reference: ;

The return of former player George Graham as manager in 1986 brought a third period of glory. Arsenal won the League Cup in 1986-87 in English football|1986–87, Graham's first season in charge. This was followed by a League title win in 1988-89 in English football|1988–89, won with a last-minute goal in the final game of the season against fellow title challengers Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool. Graham's Arsenal won another title in 1990-91 in English football|1990–91, losing only one match, the FA Cup and League Cup double in 1992-93 in English football|1992–93 and a second European trophy, the Cup Winners' Cup, in 1993-94 in English football|1993–94. However, Graham's reputation was tarnished when it was revealed that he had taken kickbacks from agent Rune Hauge for signing certain players,;Graham was banned for a year by the Football Association for his involvement in the scandal after he admitted he had received an &quot;unsolicited gift&quot; from Hauge. Reference:The case is given a detailed treatment in ; and he was sacked in 1995. His replacement, Bruce Rioch, lasted for only one season, leaving the club after a dispute with the board of directors.;;

The club's success in the late 1990s and 2000s owes a great deal to the appointment of manager Arsène Wenger in 1996. Wenger brought new tactics, a new training regime and several foreign players who complemented the existing English talent. Arsenal won a second league and cup double in 1997-98 in English football|1997–98 and a third in 2001-02 in English football|2001–02. In addition, the club reached the final of the UEFA Cup 1999-00|1999–00 UEFA Cup (losing on penalties to Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray), were victorious in the 2002-03 in English football|2002–03 and 2004-05 in English football|2004–05 FA Cups, and won the Premier League in 2003-04 in English football|2003–04 without losing a single match, which earned the side the nickname &quot;The Invincibles&quot;;;; in all, the club went 49 league matches unbeaten, a national record.

Arsenal have finished in either first or second place in the league in eight of Wenger's eleven seasons at the club.;; They are one of only four teams (along with Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea) to have won the Premier League since its formation in 1993, although they have failed to retain the title each time they have been champions.;; Until recently, Arsenal had never progressed beyond the Champions League quarter-finals; in UEFA Champions League 2005-06|2005–06 however, they reached the competition's Final, the first club from London to do so in the competition's fifty-year history, but were beaten 2–1 by FC Barcelona.; In July 2006, they moved into their current stadium, the Emirates Stadium, after 93 years at Highbury.;

Crest
Arsenal's first crest from 1888.
Arsenal's crest from ''c.'' 1949 to 2002.
Royal Arsenal's first crest, unveiled in 1888, featured three cannon viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the crest of the Borough of Woolwich. These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a wikt:cascabel|cascabel on each are clear indicators that they are cannon.;; This was dropped after the moved to Highbury in 1913, but in 1922, the club adopted their first single-cannon crest, featuring an eastward-pointing cannon, with the club's nickname, ''The Gunners'', inscribed along side it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down.; In 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon, the club's name set in blackletter above the cannon, and a scroll inscribed with the club's newly adopted Latin motto, ''Victoria Concordia Crescit'' (meaning &quot;victory comes from harmony&quot;), coined by Harry Homer, the club's programme editor.; For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green.

Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to copyright it; although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark, and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold 'unofficial' Arsenal merchandise,;; Arsenal sought a more comprehensive legal protection. Therefore, in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style, which was copyrightable.;; The cannon once again faces east and the club's name is written in a sans-serif typeface above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue. The new crest received a critical response from some supporters; the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenal's history and tradition with such a radical modern design, and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue.;;

Colours


For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red similar to burgundy, and was worn with white shorts and blue socks.;;

In 1933 Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. The origin of the white sleeves is not conclusively known, but two possible inspirations have been put forward. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.;; Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966-67 in English football|1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts;; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005-06 in English football|2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore one-year commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium. The club reverted to their traditional colours at the start of the 2006-07 in English football|2006–07 season.

Arsenal's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time;; in 1938, Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip.;;In the 1930s, S.C. Braga|Sporting Clube de Braga's coach returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit into a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of ''Os Arsenalistas''.;; These teams still wear these designs to this day.


Arsenal's away colours are traditionally yellow and blue, although they wore a green and navy away kit between 1982 and 1984.;; Since the early 1990s and the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away colours have been changed regularly; the general rule currently is that they are changed every season with the outgoing away kit becoming the third choice kit for the following season.;; Generally, the away colours in this period have been either two-tone blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001-02 in English football|2001–02 season,;; and the yellow and dark grey used in 2005-06 in English football|2005–06 and 2006-07 in English football|2006–07. However, Arsenal's domestic away colours for the 2007-08 in English football|2007–08 season are a departure from the norm, being white shirts with redcurrant shorts and hooped white and redcurrant socks.;; Arsenal's third kit for 2007–08 consists of redcurrant and obsidian hoops, and will be used for domestic games where both the first and second choice colours clash with those of their opponents, as well as being primary away kit for Champions League matches.;;

Stadiums
The North Bank Stand, Arsenal Stadium, Highbury.
The Emirates Stadium filling up on the day of Dennis Bergkamp's testimonial.
For the majority of their time in south-east London, Arsenal played at the Manor Ground in Plumstead, a three-year period at the nearby Invicta Ground between 1890 and 1893 excepted. The Manor Ground was initially just a field, but the club installed stands and terracing in time for their first Football League match in September 1893. They played there for the next twenty years, until the move to north London in 1913.

Arsenal Stadium, widely referred to as Highbury, was Arsenal's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect Archibald Leitch, and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing. In the 1930s, the entire stadium was given a massive overhaul, with new Art Deco East and West stands constructed, and roofs added to the North Bank and Clock End terraces. At its peak, Highbury could hold over 60,000 spectators, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations forced Arsenal to convert Highbury into an all-seater in time for the 1993-94 in English football|1993–94 season, reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.;; This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising hoardings, so much so that for two seasons (1998-99 in English football|1998–99 and 1999-00 in English football|1999–00) Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators. 

Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II listed building and the other three stands were close to residential properties whose owners objected to expansion. These limitations have prevented the club from maximising the revenue that their domestic form could have brought in recent seasons. After considering various options, Arsenal decided in 1999 to build a new 60,000-seater stadium at Ashburton Grove (since renamed the Emirates Stadium), about 500 metres south-west of Highbury. The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs, but construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 2006-07 in English football|2006–07 season. The stadium is named after its sponsors, the airline company Emirates, with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth approximately £100 million;;; however some fans refer to the ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they do not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names.;; The stadium will be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2012, and the airline will be the club's shirt sponsor until the end of the 2013–14 season.;

Arsenal's training centre is in Shenley, Hertfordshire, at a purpose-built facility which opened in 2000. Before that the club shared training facilities with University College London Student Union nearby, having trained at Highbury up until 1961.;; It is also where Arsenal's Arsenal F.C. Academy|Academy teams play their home matches, while the Arsenal F.C. Reserves|Reserves play their games at Underhill, home of Barnet F.C.|Barnet FC.

Supporters

Arsenal have a large and generally loyal fanbase, with virtually all home matches selling out; in 2006–07 Arsenal had the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,045, which was 99.8% of available capacity),;; and the fourth-highest all-time average attendance.; Please note that some pre-war attendance figures used by this source were estimates and may not be entirely accurate.; Arsenal fans often refer to themselves as &quot;Gooners&quot;, the name being derived from the team's nickname, &quot;The Gunners&quot;. The club's location, adjoining both wealthy areas such as Canonbury and Barnsbury, mixed areas such as Islington, Holloway and Highbury, and largely working class areas such as Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington has meant that Arsenal's supporters have come from across the usual class divides. In addition, Arsenal have the highest proportion (7.7%) of non-white attending supporters of any club in English football, according to a 2002 report.;;

Like all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters' clubs, including the Official Arsenal Football Supporters Club, which is affiliated with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association, which maintains an independent line. The club's supporters also publish fanzines such as ''The Gooner'', ''Highbury High'', ''Gunflash'' and the less cerebral ''Up The Arse!''. In addition to the usual English football chants, Arsenal's supporters sing &quot;One-Nil to the Arsenal&quot; (to the tune of &quot;Go West&quot;) and &quot;Boring, Boring Arsenal&quot;, which used to be a common taunt from opposition fans but is now sung ironically by Arsenal supporters when the team is playing well.;;

In recent times, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography, and Arsenal now have many fans not just from London but all over England and the world. While there have always been small pockets of supporters abroad, Arsenal's support base has widened considerably with the advent of satellite television, and there are now significant supporters' clubs worldwide. A 2005 report by Granada Ventures, which at the time owned a 9.9% stake in the club, estimated Arsenal's global fanbase at 27 million, the third largest in the world.;;

Arsenal's longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbours, Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur, with matches between the two being referred to as North London derbies. Matches against other London sides, such as Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea and West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United are also derbies, but the rivalry is not as intense as that between Arsenal and Tottenham. In addition, Arsenal and Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United have had a strong on-pitch rivalry since the late 1980s, which has intensified in recent years when both clubs have been competing for the Premier League title.;;

Ownership and finances
Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, operates as a non-quoted public limited company. Arsenal's ownership is considerably different from that of other football clubs. Only 62,217 shares in Arsenal have been issued,; and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the FTSE or AIM; instead, they are traded infrequently on PLUS, a specialist market. As of December 6 2007, Arsenal's market capitalisation value is £532m,;; and the club made an operating profit (excluding player transfers) of £51.2m in the year ending May 31 2007, from a turnover of £200.8m.; As of March 2007, business magazine ''Forbes'' ranks Arsenal as third most valuable team in the world, after Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United and Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid, valuing the club at £495m.;; Accountants Deloitte rate Arsenal as ninth in the 2007 Deloitte Football Money League, a ranking of the world's football clubs in terms of revenue, with the club earning £133m in the 2005-06 in English football|2005–06 season.;;

Arsenal's board of directors hold 45% of the club's shares; the largest shareholders on the board are Danny Fiszman (a London diamond dealer) and Nina Bracewell-Smith (wife of the grandson of former chairman Sir Bracewell Smith), who hold 24.1% and 15.9% respectively.; Fellow director Richard Carr has 4.4% and club chairman Peter Hill-Wood owns 0.8%, with all the other directors holding nominal amounts.;

In recent years, with other major English clubs such as Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea, Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool and Manchester United all having been taken over by foreign investors, Arsenal have been identified as a target for a buyout. The American sports tycoon Stan Kroenke, via the UK arm of Kroenke Sports Enterprises, currently owns or controls 7,584 shares or 12.2% of the club,; the bulk of which he bought from Granada Ventures (a subsidiary of ITV plc) in April 2007.;; The largest single stake in the club held by a non-board member is the 23% owned by the firm Red &amp; White Securities, which is co-owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and London-based financier Farhad Moshiri. An initial 14.6% was bought in August 2007 from former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, who is now chairman of Red &amp; White Securities,;; and was upped to 23% the following month.;; Both purchases have led to press speculation of an imminent takeover bid for the club.;; However, Arsenal's board of directors have agreed not to consider a sale of their shares to non-&quot;permitted persons&quot; until at least April 2009, and have first option on each others' shares until October 2012.;;

Arsenal in popular culture
As one of the most successful teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in British culture and have appeared in a number of media &quot;firsts&quot;. On January 22 1927, their match at Highbury against Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United was the first English League match to be broadcast live on radio.;; A decade later, on September 16 1937, an exhibition match between Arsenal's first team and the reserves was the first ever football match to be televised live.;; Arsenal also featured in the first edition of the BBC's ''Match of the Day'', which screened highlights of their match against Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool at Anfield on August 22 1964.;;

Arsenal also formed the backdrop to one of the earliest football-related films, ''The Arsenal Stadium Mystery'' (1939).;; The film is centred on a friendly match between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned whilst playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves, although only manager George Allison was given a speaking part.

More recently, the book ''Fever Pitch'' by Nick Hornby was an autobiographical account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of, and may have played an active part in, the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s. The book was later made into a film starring Colin Firth, which centred on the club's 1988-89 in English football|1988–89 title win. The book also inspired an American film adaptation, about a fan of Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox.

Arsenal have often been stereotyped as a defensive and &quot;boring&quot; side, especially during the 1970s and 1980s; many comedians, such as Eric Morecambe, made jokes about this at the team's expense. The theme was repeated in the 1997 film ''The Full Monty'', in a scene where the lead actors move in a line and raise their hands, deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defence's offside trap, in an attempt to co-ordinate their stripping.;; Another film reference to the club's defence comes in the film ''Plunkett &amp; Macleane'', in which there are two characters named Dixon and Winterburn, named after Arsenal's long serving full backs – the right-sided Lee Dixon and the left-sided Nigel Winterburn.;

The club have also been mentioned in several ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' sketches, and in Douglas Adams' ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', where a barman remarks that the impending end of the world is a &quot;lucky escape&quot; for Arsenal. Additionally, in the 2004 film ''Ocean's Twelve'', the main characters don Arsenal tracksuits as a disguise, in order to escape from a hotel during one of their European heists.

Arsenal have featured in popular music as well; Joe Strummer wrote the song &quot;Tony Adams&quot;, dedicated to the then Arsenal captain, which appeared on his 1999 album ''Rock Art and the X-Ray Style.''Strummer was also known to wear an Arsenal scarf during gigs despite himself being a Chelsea fan. Additionally, Arsenal (along with arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur) receive a mention in The Pogues song &quot;Billy's Bones&quot;, which appears on the band's second album, ''Rum, Sodomy and the Lash.''

Arsenal Ladies
 ;
Arsenal L.F.C.|Arsenal Ladies are the women's football club affiliated to Arsenal. Founded in 1987, they turned semi-professional in 2002 and are managed by Vic Akers, who is also kit manager for the men's side. Arsenal Ladies are the most successful team in English women's football today; they are the current reigning champions of the FA Women's Premier League and holders of the UEFA Women's Cup, having won both in the 2006–07 season as part of a unique quadruple, along with the FA Women's Cup and FA Women's Premier League Cup. Although the men's and women's clubs are formally separate they have quite close ties; Arsenal FC's managing director Keith Edelman is president of Arsenal LFC, a role previously held by David Dein and Arsenal Ladies are entitled to play once a season at the Emirates Stadium, though they usually play their home matches at Boreham Wood F.C.|Boreham Wood.

Statistics and records

David O'Leary holds the record for Arsenal appearances, having played 722 first-team matches between 1975 and 1993. Fellow centre half and former captain Tony Adams comes second, having played 669 times. The record for a goalkeeper is held by David Seaman, with 563 appearances.;;

Thierry Henry is the club's top goalscorer with 226 goals in all competitions between 1999 and 2007 having surpassed Ian Wright's total of 185 in October 2005.;; Wright's record had stood since September 1997, a feat which overtook the longstanding total of 178 goals set by winger Cliff Bastin in 1939.;; Henry also holds the club record for goals scored in the League — 174; — a record that had been held by Bastin until February 2006.
