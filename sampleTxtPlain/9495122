The February 2007 North America Winter Storm (otherwise referred to as the Valentine's Day Blizzard or Valentine's Day Storm) was a massive winter storm that affected most of the eastern half of North America, starting on February 12 2007 and peaking on Valentine's Day, February 14. The storm produced heavy snowfalls across the midwestern United States from Nebraska to Ohio and produced similar conditions across parts of the northeastern United States,and into Canada in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. Significant sleet and freezing rain fell across the southern Ohio Valley and affected portions of the east coast of the United States, including the cities of Boston, Baltimore, Washington D.C., New York City and Philadelphia. 

The southern portion of the storm produced severe thunderstorms with numerous tornadoes reported. One tornado hit a subdivision of New Orleans that was still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Katrina, which hit the region in August 2005. In total, this storm system was responsible for 37 deaths across 13 U.S. states and Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec. The NOAA classified the storm as a Category 3 &quot;Major&quot; storm.;;The National Weather Service has determined that this storm was one of the three largest snowstorms to hit the inland areas of the northeastern United States since 1940.;;

Prior to the storm
In sharp contrast to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta Clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, led to the development of the storm.

Previously, portions of the Great Lakes were hit by a significant lake effect snow event which dumped incredible amounts of snow over portions of central New York. Several areas received over 115 inches (over 250 cm) of snow in a ten-day period just before the large winter storm as northwesterly winds and unfrozen lake surfaces due to the early winter warm weather favored the heavy snowfall. Several areas across Michigan and Ontario also received significant amounts of snow with locally 1 meter of snow (3.3 feet) east of Georgian Bay in Ontario.; ;

From February 10 to 11, a low pressure system developed near the Rockies and moved towards the Great Plains of the United States. It later tracked across the Ohio Valley and merged with a new coastal low. It then moved over eastern Quebec on Valentine's Day before exiting northeastern Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador on February 16. It dumped over six inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow across numerous areas from Iowa to New Brunswick, including major cities such as Akron, Detroit, Champaign-Urbana, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Springfield, Peoria, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Dayton, Toledo, Cincinnati, London, Hamilton, the Niagara Region, Toronto, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Trois-Rivieres, Quebec|Trois-Rivieres, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Rochester, Windsor, Syracuse and Albany. This also includes areas such as Northern Oswego County, New York, which received historic lake effect snowfall amounts in the week prior to the storm.

In addition to the general snowfall, snow squalls coming from Lake Ontario gave local amounts of over 2 feet (60 cm) of snow near the Hamilton and Niagara regions, where 1 foot of snow had already fallen on February 13.;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2007/02/13/storm-ontario.html Snowstorm rumbling through Ontario, moving east], CBC, February 13, 2007;

Heavy ice amounts fell for locations along Interstate 95 from Maine to Virginia and west towards southern Ohio and Indiana. Ice was expected for parts of the Canadian Maritimes.

=Precipitation received=
The storm left a mark on states like Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, which received heavy snow for over 24 hours, accumulating upwards of 18 inches (45.72 cm) in some areas. In Chicago, O'Hare International Airport received 10.2 inches (25.9 cm) of snow, while Midway Airport received 12.0 inches. The Midway total was the largest amount of snow received in the month of February for one midnight-to-midnight day since records began to be kept in 1928. ;;

Areas of the Appalachian Mountains in northern New England and Quebec received accumulations of over 16 inches (40 cm) with local amount exceeding 3 feet (90 cm) in parts of Vermont and 42 inches (105 cm)in the Adirondacks in New York State. Also in New York State, in the hills and valleys South of Syracuse, NY, some places received anywhere's from a 24 inches of snow to 50 inches of snow. The City of Hamilton and the Niagara region, at their highest elevations, received just over 27.6 inches (70 cm) due to snowsqualls off of Lake Ontario. Burlington, Vermont recorded record 24-hour snowfall, with 25.3 inches.;;

On the other hand, places like Boston and Hartford saw very little precipitation from the storm.In fact, Boston is close to setting a record for the least snow in any season.;;

A notable feature of the system was its array of precipitation type. While the interior sections of the Northeast received mostly snow from the system, the Mid-Atlantic received snow, sleet, freezing rain and non-freezing rain. Due to the three-dimensional nature of the atmosphere, warm air was poised to overtake the cold air closer to the ground, causing precipitation to melt, then refreeze as either sleet or freezing rain.As temperatures hovered around freezing on the southern edge of the storm track, light snow accompanied freezing rain and sleet. The freezing rain coated all surfaces with thick layers of ice, including power lines and tree limbs which break under the additional weight. Some locations in the Mid-Atlantic received several inches of sleet. Four inches of sleet caused travel difficulties and hampered cleanup efforts in New York City. New York City's sanitation department admitted to not plowing city streets, expecting the frozen precipitation to change from ice to rain. However, this never happened. Instead, Temperatures dropped very quickly and caused the slush on sidewalks and roads to freeze into thick, rock hard sheets of ice.
Streets were almost impassable during the evening rush hour resulting in complete chaos. 
An ice-covered mailbox near Fredericksburg, Virginia demonstrates how freezing rain along the storm's southern track left surfaces coated with ice.;

Ice accumulations in Virginia and Maryland reached locally three-quarters of an inch (20 mm);; while it reached 1 inch in central Ohio near Columbus and Xenia, with up to .7 inches near Cincinnati.;;

The effect on much of Michigan by the storm was light, although the extreme southern part of the state was hard hit with heavy snowfall, especially the Detroit Metro area. Wind whipped snow accumulations ranged from 7 to 10 inches fell throughout the area, especially the southeastern suburbs, including 8.5&quot; at both Detroit Metropolitan Airport and Wyandotte, and 8.4&quot; in Dundee. Drifts were as high as two to three feet, and the snow was very powdery as it fell with temperatures around 10 degrees fahrenheit.

Due to the near-record amounts of snow in the Appalachian mountain chain, National Weather Service officials had issued statement for a higher risk of avalanches across northern New England.;;

=Damage and travel disruptions=

Numerous flights were canceled due to the snow and ice across various airports including in Toronto, Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport|Ottawa, Québec/Jean Lesage International Airport|Quebec City, Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Montreal, Kansas City, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport|Cleveland, Boston and Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport|Cincinnati. 900 were canceled at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.
