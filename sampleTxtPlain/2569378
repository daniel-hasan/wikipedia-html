Hurricane Katrina was the costliest and one of the five deadliest hurricanes in the history of the United States.;; It was the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded and the third-strongest hurricane on record that made landfall in the United States. Katrina formed on August 23 during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and caused devastation along much of the north-central Gulf Coast. The most severe loss of life and property damage occurred in New Orleans, Louisiana, which flooded as the levee system catastrophically failed, in many cases hours after the storm had moved inland.; The hurricane caused severe destruction across the entire Mississippi coast and into Alabama, as far as 100&amp;nbsp;miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) from the storm's center. Katrina was the eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, third Tropical cyclone#Classifications.2C terminology.2C and naming|major hurricane, and second Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5 hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic season.

It formed over the Bahamas on August 23, 2005, and crossed southern Florida as a moderate Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1 hurricane, causing some deaths and flooding there, before strengthening rapidly in the Gulf of Mexico and becoming one of the strongest hurricanes on record while at sea. The storm weakened before making its second and third landfalls as a Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3 storm on the morning of August 29 in southeast Louisiana and at the Louisiana/Mississippi state line, respectively.

The storm surge caused severe damage along the Gulf Coast, devastating the Mississippi cities of Waveland, Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis, Pass Christian, Long Beach, Gulfport, Biloxi, Ocean Springs, and Pascagoula. In Louisiana, the federal flood protection system in New Orleans failed in more than 50 places. Nearly every levee in metro New Orleans breached as Hurricane Katrina passed east of the city, subsequently flooding 80% of the city and many areas of neighboring parishes for weeks.;;

At least 1,836 people lost their lives in Hurricane Katrina and in the subsequent floods, making it the deadliest U.S. hurricane since the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. The storm is estimated to have been responsible for $81.2 billion (2005 U.S. dollars) in damage, making it the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. The catastrophic failure of the flood protection in New Orleans prompted immediate review of the Army Corps of Engineers since the agency has by congressional mandate sole responsibility for design and construction of the flood protection. There was also widespread criticism of the federal, state and local governments' reaction to the storm and resulting in an investigation by the U.S. Congress and the resignation of Federal Emergency Management Agency director Michael D. Brown. Conversely, the National Hurricane Center and National Weather Service were widely commended for accurate forecasts and abundant lead time.;

Storm history



Hurricane Katrina formed as Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23, 2005 as the result of an interaction of a tropical wave and the remains of List of 2005 Atlantic hurricane season storms#Tropical Depression Ten|Tropical Depression Ten. The system was upgraded to Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|tropical storm status on the morning of August 24 and at this point, the storm was given the name ''Katrina.'' The tropical storm continued to move towards Florida, and became a hurricane only two hours before it made landfall between Hallandale Beach and Aventura, Florida on the morning of August 25. The storm weakened over land, but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the Gulf of Mexico.;

The storm rapidly intensified after entering the Gulf, partly because of the storm's movement over the warm waters of the Loop Current.;Leben, Robert; Born, George; Scott, Jim. &quot;[http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/358.html CU-Boulder Researchers Chart Katrina's Growth In Gulf Of Mexico].&quot; ''University of Colorado at Boulder.'' September 15, 2005. Retrieved on 2006-06-05.; On August 27, the storm reached Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, becoming the third Tropical cyclone#Categories and ranking|major hurricane of the season. An eyewall#Eyewall replacement cycles|eyewall replacement cycle disrupted the intensification, but caused the storm to nearly double in size. Katrina again rapidly intensified, attaining Category 5 status on the morning of August 28 and reached its peak strength at 1:00 p.m. CDT that day, with maximum sustained winds of 175&amp;nbsp;mph (280&amp;nbsp;km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 902&amp;nbsp;mbar. The pressure measurement made Katrina the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record at the time, only to be surpassed by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma later in the season; it was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico at the time (a record also later broken by Rita).;

Katrina made its second landfall at 6:10 a.m. CDT; on August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125&amp;nbsp;mph (205&amp;nbsp;km/h) near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended outward 120&amp;nbsp;miles (190&amp;nbsp;km) from the center and the storm's central pressure was 920&amp;nbsp;mbar. After moving over southeastern Louisiana and Breton Sound, it made its third landfall near the Louisiana/Mississippi border with 120&amp;nbsp;mph (195&amp;nbsp;km/h) sustained winds, still at Category 3 intensity.;

Katrina maintained strength well into Mississippi, finally losing hurricane strength more than 150&amp;nbsp;miles (240&amp;nbsp;km) inland near Meridian, Mississippi. It was downgraded to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee, but its remnants were last distinguishable in the eastern Great Lakes region on August 31, when it was absorbed by a Surface weather analysis#cold front|frontal boundary. The resulting extratropical storm moved rapidly to the northeast and affected Ontario and Quebec.;

Flanked by Michael Chertoff, Secretary of Homeland Security, left, and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, President George W. Bush meets with members of the White House Task Force on Hurricane Katrina Recovery on August 31, 2005, in the Cabinet Room of the White House.

On the morning of August 26, at 10 a.m. CDT (1500&amp;nbsp;UTC), Katrina had strengthened to a Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3 storm in the Gulf of Mexico. Later that afternoon, the NHC realized that Katrina had yet to make the turn toward the Florida Panhandle and ended up revising the predicted track of the storm from the panhandle to the Mississippi coast.;Spann, James.

During video conferences involving the President on August 28 and 29, the director of the National Hurricane Center at the time, Max Mayfield, expressed concern that Katrina might push its storm surge over the city's levees and flood walls. In one conference, he stated, &quot;I do not think anyone can tell you with confidence right now whether the levees will be topped or not, but that's obviously a very, very great concern.&quot;;;

On August 28, as the sheer size of Katrina became clear, the NHC extended the tropical storm warning zone to cover most of the Louisiana coastline and a larger portion of the Florida Panhandle. The National Weather Service's New Orleans/Baton Rouge office issued a vividly-worded bulletin predicting that the area would be &quot;uninhabitable for weeks&quot; after &quot;devastating damage&quot; caused by Katrina, which at that time rivaled the intensity of Hurricane Camille.;&quot;[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/data/warn_archive/LIX/NPW/0828_214001.txt NWS bulletin].&quot; ''National Weather Service/New Orleans, Louisiana.''

On August 29, Katrina's storm surge caused 53 different levee breaches in greater New Orleans submerging eighty percent of the city. A June 2007 expert report stated that two-thirds of the flooding were due to levee breaches [http://www.asce.org/static/hurricane/whitehouse.cfm]. The storm surge also devastated the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama, making Katrina the most destructive and costliest natural disaster in the history of the United States, and the deadliest hurricane since the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. The total damage from Katrina is estimated at $81.2 billion (2005 U.S. dollars), nearly double the cost of the previously most expensive storm, Hurricane Andrew, when adjusted for inflation.;;;

On August 29 Hurricane Katrina made landfall near Buras, Louisiana with 125&amp;nbsp;mph (205&amp;nbsp;km/h) winds, as a strong Category 3 storm. However, as it had only just weakened from Category 4 strength and the radius of maximum winds was large, it is possible that sustained winds of Category 4 strength briefly impacted extreme southeastern Louisiana. Although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in Mississippi was higher, a very significant surge affected the Louisiana coast. The height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data, although a tide gauge in Plaquemines Parish indicated a storm tide in excess of 14&amp;nbsp;feet (4.3&amp;nbsp;m) and a 12&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) storm surge was recorded in Grand Isle.;

As the eye of Hurricane Katrina swept to the northeast, it subjected the city to hurricane conditions for hours. Although power failures prevented accurate measurement of wind speeds in New Orleans, there were a few measurements of hurricane-force winds. From this the NHC concluded that it is likely that much of the city experienced sustained winds of Category 1 or Category 2 strength.

Katrina's storm surge led to 53 levee breaches in the federally built levee system protecting metro New Orleans. Failures occurred in New Orleans, Louisiana and surrounding communities especially St. Bernard Parish. The Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MR-GO) breached its levees in approximately 20 places, flooding much of east New Orleans, most of Saint Bernard Parish and the East Bank of Plaquemines Parish.

U.S. Route 90|U.S. Route 90's Bay St. Louis Bridge on Pass Christian was destroyed as a result of Katrina.
The Gulf coast of Mississippi suffered massive damage from the impact of Hurricane Katrina on August 29, leaving 238&amp;nbsp;people dead, 67&amp;nbsp;missing, and billions of dollars in damage: bridges, barges, boats, piers, houses and cars were washed inland.;;
Katrina traveled up the entire state, and afterwards, all 82 counties in Mississippi were declared disaster areas for federal assistance, 47 for full assistance.;

After making a brief initial landfall in Louisiana, Katrina had made its final landfall near the state line, and the eyewall passed over the cities of Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis and Waveland as a Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 120&amp;nbsp;mph (195&amp;nbsp;km/h).; Katrina's powerful right-front quadrant passed over the west and central Mississippi coast causing a powerful 27&amp;nbsp;foot (8.2&amp;nbsp;m) storm surge, which penetrated 6&amp;nbsp;miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) inland in many areas and up to 12&amp;nbsp;miles (20&amp;nbsp;km) inland along bays and rivers; in some areas, the surge crossed Interstate 10 for several miles.; Hurricane Katrina brought strong winds to Mississippi which caused significant tree damage throughout the state. The highest unofficial reported wind gust recorded from Katrina was one of 135&amp;nbsp;mph (217&amp;nbsp;km/h) in Poplarville, in Pearl River County.;

The storm also brought heavy rains with 8 – 10&amp;nbsp;inches (200 – 250&amp;nbsp;mm) falling in southwestern Mississippi and rain in excess of 4&amp;nbsp;inches (100&amp;nbsp;mm) falling throughout the majority of the state. Katrina caused eleven tornadoes in Mississippi on August 29, some of which damaged trees and power lines.;

Battered by wind, rain and storm surge, some beachfront neighborhoods were completely leveled. Preliminary estimates by Mississippi officials calculated that 90% of the structures within half a mile of the coastline were completely destroyed,;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/09/01/katrina/main810916.shtml Mississippi Coast Areas Wiped Out].&quot; ''CBS News.''

More than half of the 13 casinos in the state, which were floated on barges to comply with Mississippi land-based gambling laws, were washed hundreds of yards inland by waves.;

A number of streets and bridges were washed away. On U.S. Highway 90 along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, two major bridges were completely destroyed: the Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis - Pass Christian; bridge, and the Biloxi - Ocean Springs bridge. In addition, the eastbound span of the I-10 bridge over the Pascagoula River estuary was damaged. In the weeks after the storm, with the connectivity of the coastal U.S. Highway 90 shattered, traffic traveling parallel to the coast was reduced to two lanes on the remaining I-10 span.

Surge damage in Pascagoula, Mississippi
All three coastal counties of the state were severely affected by the storm. Katrina's surge was the most extensive, as well as the highest, in the documented history of the United States; large portions of both Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson Counties were inundated by the storm surge, in all three cases affecting most of the populated areas.;; Surge covered almost the entire lower half of Hancock County, destroying the coastal communities of Clermont Harbor and Waveland, much of Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis, and flowed up the Jourdan River, flooding Kiln. In Harrison County, Pass Christian was completely inundated, along with a narrow strip of land to the east along the coast, which includes the cities of Long Beach and Gulfport; the flooding was more extensive in communities such as D'Iberville, which borders Back Bay. Biloxi, on a peninsula between the Back Bay and the coast, was particularly hard hit, especially the low-lying Point Cadet area. In Jackson County, storm surge flowed up the wide river estuary, with the combined surge and freshwater flooding cutting the county in half. Remarkably, over 90% of Pascagoula, the easternmost coastal city in Mississippi, and abouteast of Katrina's landfall near the Louisiana-Mississippi border, was flooded from surge at the height of the storm. Other large Jackson County neighborhoods such as Porteaux Bay and Gulf Hills were severely damaged with large portions being completely destroyed, and St. Martin, Mississippi|St. Martin was hard hit; Ocean Springs, Moss Point, Gautier, and Escatawpa also suffered major surge damage.

Mississippi Emergency Management Agency officials also recorded deaths in Forrest, Hinds, Warren, and Leake counties. Over 900,000&amp;nbsp;people throughout the state experienced power outages.;

Sustained winds of 67&amp;nbsp;mph (107&amp;nbsp;km/h) were recorded in Mobile, Alabama, and the storm surge there was approximately 12&amp;nbsp;feet (3.7&amp;nbsp;m).; The surge caused significant flooding several miles inland along Mobile Bay. Four tornadoes were also reported in Alabama.; Ships, oil rigs, boats and fishing piers were washed ashore along Mobile Bay: the cargo ship M/V ''Caribbean Clipper'' and many fishing boats were grounded at Bayou La Batre.

An oil rig under construction along the Mobile River broke its moorings and floated 1.5&amp;nbsp;miles (2&amp;nbsp;km) northwards before striking the Cochrane Bridge just outside Mobile. No significant damage resulted to the bridge and it was soon reopened. The damage on Dauphin Island was severe, with the surge destroying many houses and cutting a new canal through the western portion of the island. An offshore oil rig also became grounded on the island. As in Mississippi, the storm surge caused significant beach erosion along the Alabama coastline.; More than 600,000 people lost power in Alabama as a result of Hurricane Katrina and two people died in a traffic accident in the state.;

Within the United States and as delineated in the National Response Plan, disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility. When local government exhausts its resources, it then requests specific additional resources from the county level. The request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified. Many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communications systems at various levels.

Some disaster recovery response to Katrina began before the storm, with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a mortuary team with refrigerated trucks. A network of volunteers began rendering assistance to local residents and residents emerging from New Orleans and surrounding parishes as soon as the storm made landfall, and continued for more than six months after the storm.

Criticism was prompted largely by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders and of residents who remained in New Orleans without water, food or shelter. The deaths of citizens by thirst, exhaustion, and violence days after the storm itself had passed also fueled the criticism, as did the treatment of people who had been evacuated to facilities such as the Superdome. Others alleged that race, class, and other factors could have contributed to delays in government response. The percentage of black victims among storm-related deaths (49%);; was below their proportion in the area's population (approx. 60%;&quot;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/18/national/main1913712.shtml?source=RSS&amp;attr=U.S._1913712 New Orleans population statistics].&quot; ''Associated Press.''

).

The government was accused of making things worse, instead of making things better, by preventing help by others while delaying its own response. In accordance with federal law, President George W. Bush directed the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, to coordinate the Federal response. Chertoff designated Michael D. Brown, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as the Principal Federal Official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the Gulf Coast region. However, the President and Secretary Chertoff initially came under harsh criticism for what some perceived as a lack of planning and coordination. Eight days later, Brown was recalled to Washington and Coast Guard Vice Admiral Thad W. Allen replaced him as chief of hurricane relief operations.;Meserve, Jeanne; Barrett, Ted. &quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/09/katrina.washington/index.html Admiral takes over Katrina relief].&quot; ''CNN.'' September 9, 2005. Retrieved on 2006-06-05.; Three days after the recall, Michael D. Brown resigned as director of FEMA in spite of having received praise from Bush with the now-well-known phrase, ''&quot;Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job.&quot;'';;

On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief on NBC, ''A Concert for Hurricane Relief'', Kanye West was a featured speaker. Controversy arose when West was presenting, as he deviated from the prepared script:

;''I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, 'They're looting.' You see a white family, it says, 'They're looking for food.' And, you know, it's been five days &amp;#91;waiting for federal help&amp;#93; because most of the people are black. And even for me to complain about it, I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the teacher-the TV because it's too hard to watch. I've even been shopping before even giving a donation, so now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can give, and just to imagine if I was down there, and those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help — with the way America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off, as slow as possible. I mean, the Red Cross is doing everything they can. We already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting another way — and they've given them permission to go down and shoot us!'';

Mike Myers, with whom West was paired to present, spoke next and continued as normal by reading the script. Once it was West's turn to speak again, West delivered the controversial phrase:



Although the camera quickly cut away to Chris Tucker, West's comments still reached the East Coast broadcasts, and was replayed or discussed afterwards.

Kanye West and Mike Myers met again on a brief sketch on ''Saturday Night Live'', in which Myers joked that since the telethon, the government has stripped him of his American citizenship (&quot;still got my Canadian citizenship to fall back on,&quot; Myers joked), and placed him under heavy government surveillance.

Criticism from politicians, activists, pundits and journalists of all stripes was directed at the local and state and governments headed by Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans and Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco. Nagin and Blanco were criticized for failing to implement New Orleans' evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin was that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until 19&amp;nbsp;hours before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who (by that time) could not find any way out of the city.;

The destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina raised other, more general public policy issues about emergency management, environmental policy, poverty, and unemployment. The discussion of both the immediate response and of the broader public policy issues may have affected elections and legislation enacted at various levels of government. The storm's devastation also prompted a Congressional investigation, which found that FEMA and the Red Cross &quot;did not have a logistics capacity sophisticated enough to fully support the massive number of Gulf coast victims.&quot; Additionally, it placed responsibility for the disaster on all three levels of government.;

An ABC News Poll conducted on September 2, 2005, showed slightly more blame was being directed at state and local governments (75%) than at the Federal government (67%), with 44% blaming President Bush's leadership directly.;Langer, Gary. &quot;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/HurricaneKatrina/story?id=1094262&amp;page=1 Poll: Bush Not Taking Brunt of Katrina Criticism].&quot; ''ABC News.''

=Analysis of New Orleans levee failures=

A June 2007 report released by the American Society of Civil Engineers states that the failures of the federally built levees in New Orleans' were found to be primarily the result of system design flaws.; http://www.asce.org/static/hurricane/whitehouse.cfm; The US Army Corps of Engineers who by federal mandate is responsible for the conception, design and construction of the region's flood-control system failed to pay sufficient attention to public safety.

According to new modeling and field observations by a team from Louisiana State University, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO), a 200-meter (660&amp;nbsp;ft) wide canal designed to provide a shortcut from New Orleans to the Gulf of Mexico, helped provide a funnel for the storm surge, making it 20% higher and 100%-200% faster as it crashed into the city. St. Bernard Parish, one of the more devastated areas, lies just south of the MRGO. The Army Corps of Engineers disputes this causality and maintains Katrina would have overwhelmed the levees with or without the contributing effect of the MRGO.;Warrick, Joby; Grunwald, Michael. &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/23/AR2005102301200_pf.html Investigators Link Levee Failures to Design Flaws].&quot; ''Washington Post.'' October 24, 2005. Retrieved on 2006-06-05.;

On April 5, 2006, months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength, Lieutenant General Carl Strock testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that &quot;We have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure.&quot;;Staff Writers &quot;[http://www.unregisterednews.com/content/view/184/53/ Problems with the design of levees].&quot; ''Unregistered News.'' September 29, 2005. Retrieved on 2007-05-25.; He also testified that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not know of this mechanism of failure prior to August 29, 2005. The claim of ignorance is refuted, however, by the National Science Foundation investigators hired by the Army Corps of Engineers, who point to a 1986 study by the Corps itself that such separations were possible in the I-wall design.;;

Various conspiracy theories began floating around that the levees were in fact deliberately demolished. A number of New Orleans residents described hearing &quot;explosions&quot; coming from the Industrial Canal levee in the Lower 9th Ward before the floodwaters rushed in. A National Guard worker claims he was sworn to secrecy upon finding explosives residue at the site of the break.;;

=Media involvement=

Geraldo Rivera reporting from the New Orleans Convention Center on September 2, 2005.
Many representatives of the news media reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events, instead of simply reporting. Because of the loss of most means of communication, such as land-based and cellular telephone systems, field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities.

The authorities, who monitored local and network news broadcasts, as well as internet sites, would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports. One illustration was when Geraldo Rivera of Fox News tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center.;&quot;[http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2678976 Geraldo Rivera &amp; Shepard Smith Unleashed].&quot; &amp;mdash; ''Video.'' 2005. Retrieved on 2006-06-05.;

The storm also brought a dramatic rise in the role of Internet sites - especially blogging and community journalism. One example was the effort of ''NOLA.com'', the web affiliate of New Orleans' ''The Times-Picayune|Times-Picayune'', which was awarded the Breaking News Pulitzer Prize,;; and shared the Public Service Pulitzer with the Biloxi-based ''Sun Herald''.;; The newspaper's coverage was carried for days only on NOLA's blogs, as the newspaper lost its presses and evacuated its building as water rose around it on August 30. The site became an international focal point for news by local media, and also became a vital link for rescue operations and later for reuniting scattered residents, as it accepted and posted thousands of individual pleas for rescue on its blogs and forums. NOLA was monitored constantly by an array of rescue teams - from individuals to the Coast Guard - which used information in rescue efforts. Much of this information was relayed from trapped victims via the SMS functions of their cell phones, to friends and relatives outside the area, who then relayed the information back to NOLA.com. The aggregation of community journalism, user photos and the use of the internet site as a collaborative response to the storm attracted international attention, and was called a watershed moment in journalism.;; In the wake of these online-only efforts, the Pulitzer Committee for the first time opened all its categories to online entries.;;

As the U.S. military and rescue services regained control over the city, there were restrictions on the activity of the media. On September 9, the military leader of the relief effort announced that reporters would have &quot;zero access&quot; to efforts to recover bodies in New Orleans. Immediately following this announcement, CNN filed a lawsuit and obtained a temporary restraining order against the ban. The next day the government backed down and reversed the ban.;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/LAW/09/10/katrina.media/ U.S. won't ban media from New Orleans searches].&quot; ''CNN.''

=Retirement=

Because of the large loss of life and property along the Gulf Coast, the name Katrina was officially retired on April 6, 2006 by the World Meteorological Organization at the request of the U.S. government. It was replaced by Katia on List III of the Lists of tropical cyclone names#North Atlantic|Atlantic hurricane naming lists, which will next be used in the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season.;;
