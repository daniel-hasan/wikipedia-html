Tropical Storm Ingrid was a weak tropical storm that existed in September 2007. Ingrid developed on September 12, as a tropical depression. The depression had become a tropical Storm on September 13, and it reached its peak intensity of 45&amp;nbsp;mph (75 km/h) that evening, over the deep tropical Atlantic. It continued westward, and on September 18, it had dissipated. It remained a weak storm throughout it's existence; It did not directly affect any land areas, or ships. 

Storm history

The system's origins were from a large tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on September 6. Strong easterly shear inhibited its development over the next three days until September 9, when it developed a broad area of low pressure in the central Atlantic about midway between the coast of Africa and the Lesser Antilles.;; The wind shear began to slowly weaken, and Dvorak classifications were initiated on the low on September 11. By the morning of September 12, the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight about 1125&amp;nbsp;miles (1815&amp;nbsp;km) east of the Lesser Antilles.;

The system moved in a general west-northwest direction for nearly all of its lifespan, remaining on the southern edge of a mid-tropospheric ridge. Unfavorable wind shear slowed down development significantly and the system remained a tropical depression for 24&amp;nbsp;hours before convection increased and the storm strengthened into a weak tropical storm early on September 13. Slow strengthening continued that afternoon and the storm reached its peak intensity of 45&amp;nbsp;mph (75&amp;nbsp;km/h) that evening.; Operationally, the depression was not upgraded to a tropical storm until that evening, at which point the storm was near its peak intensity.;;

Further intensification of the cyclone was halted by very strong wind shear due to the presence of a strong tropical upper tropospheric trough.; Despite the high shear, Ingrid remained a weak tropical storm until the afternoon of September 15, when it weakened to a tropical depression while east of the Leeward Islands.; Gradual weakening continued afterward as it passed to the northeast of the islands, although the system remained a tropical depression as it continued to produce deep convection.;; Ingrid briefly reorganized itself on September 16 but that trend was short-lived, and it became very disorganized once again that afternoon.;; The weakening trend continued, and the final advisory was issued early on September 17 as the system degenerated into an open wave while remaining north of the Leeward Islands.;; The remnant low turned to the northwest within the low-level steering flow, and dissipated on September 18 without any redevelopment.;

Impact
Ingrid's sheared circulation remained just east and northeast of the Lesser Antilles and dissipated without directly impacting any land.; Its remnants brought heavy rainfall and thunder to Antigua,;; while on Saint Martin the system dropped 1.5&amp;nbsp;inches (38&amp;nbsp;mm) of rain in about an hour, which caused some roadway flooding.;; No damage or casualties were reported, and no ships or land stations recorded tropical storm-force winds.;
