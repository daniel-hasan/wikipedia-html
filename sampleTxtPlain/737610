Dynamite was used to blow up a rotting beached whale, which had some unintended consequences.
Exploding whales have been documented on two notable occasions, as well as several lesser-known ones. The most famous explosion occurred in the United States at Florence, Oregon, in 1970, when a dead sperm whale (originally reported as a gray whale) was blown up by the Oregon Highway Division in an attempt to dispose of its rotting carcass. This incident became famous in the U.S. when American humorist Dave Barry wrote about it in his newspaper column after viewing a videotape of television footage of the explosion. It later became well-known internationally when the same footage circulated on the Internet. 

There have also been spontaneous explosions. The other best-reported case of an exploding whale was in Taiwan in 2004, when a buildup of gas inside a decomposing sperm whale caused it to explode while it was being transported for a post-mortem examination. As exploding whales are an interesting and absurd topic, they have been written about by several authors.

Incidents
Documented cases of exploding animals are fairly rare. Whale explosions in the United States and Taiwan were widely covered by the world press. However, there have been less famous incidents in other parts of the world. 

=Florence, Oregon, USA=
The Oregon Highway Division failed to dispose of this whale carcass properly when they blew it up with half a ton of dynamite.

On November 12, 1970, a , eight-ton sperm whale died as a result of beaching itself near Florence, Oregon.;Linnman, Paul and Doug Brazil, Chapter 7. Linnman contacted Dr. Bruce Mate, a marine biologist at the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport who was there that day. Dr. Mate says that it was not a gray whale, but was in fact a sperm whale.; Since all Oregon beaches are under the jurisdiction of the state Parks and Recreation Department,;[http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/ Oregon State Archives]. Oregon Secretary of State, Archives Division, 1998. [http://bluebook.state.or.us/state/executive/Parks_Recreation/parks_recreation_history.htm State Parks and Recreation Department - Agency History]In the ''[http://bluebook.state.or.us/ Oregon Blue Book]'' online.Accessed September 22, 2006.; responsibility for disposing of the carcass fell upon the Oregon Highway Division (now known as the Oregon Department of Transportation, or ODOT), a sister agency.;The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) is the parent department of both agencies.;After consulting with officials at the United States Navy, they decided that it would be best to remove the whale in the same way they would remove a boulder and, on November 12, used half a ton of dynamite on it. They thought burying the whale would be ineffective, as it would soon be uncovered, and they believed the use of dynamite would cause an explosion that would disintegrate the whale into pieces small enough for scavengers to clear up. The engineer in charge of the operation, George Thornton, was recorded as stating that one set of charges might not be enough and more might be needed. Thornton later explained that he was chosen to remove the whale because the district engineer, Dale Allen, had gone hunting.;Report by Paul Linnman (KATU TV), transcribed by Hackstadt, J.; Hackstadt, S. [http://www.theexplodingwhale.com/evidence/resources/transcript/ Annotated transcript of the video]. theexplodingwhale.comAccessed January 8, 2007.;;; 

The resulting explosion was caught on film by television photographer Doug Brazil for a story reported by news reporter Paul Linnman of KATU-TV in Portland, Oregon.In his voiceover, Linnman joked that &quot;land-lubber newsmen&quot; became &quot;land-''blubber'' newsmen&quot;, for &quot;the blast blasted blubber beyond all believable bounds.&quot;; The explosion caused large pieces of blubber to land some distance away from the beach, resulting in a smashed car. The explosion disintegrated only some of the whale, most of which remained on the beach for the Oregon Highway Division workers to clear away.

At the end of his news story, Paul Linnman noted that &quot;It might be concluded that should a whale ever be washed ashore in Lane County again, those in charge will not only remember what to do, they'll certainly remember what ''not'' to do.&quot; It was reported in the ODOT's employee newspaper, ''TranScript'', that when 41 sperm whales beached nearby in 1979, state parks officials burned and buried them.;[http://tafkac.org/animals/exploding.whale/son_of_blubber.html &quot;Son of blubber&quot;]. Oregon Department of Transportation employee newspaper, ''TranScript'', July 1994. Accessed January 8, 2007.; Today, beach managers tow dead beached whales to the open sea. This is done mainly for safety reasons, as the rotting corpses have been known to attract sharks and so become a danger to beach users. 

For several years, the story of the exploding whale was commonly disbelieved and thought to be an urban legend. However, it was brought to widespread public attention by popular writer Dave Barry in his ''Miami Herald'' column of May 20, 1990, when he reported that he had footage of the event. Barry wrote, &quot;Here at the Institute we watch it often, especially at parties.&quot; Some time later the Oregon State Highway division started to receive calls from the media after a shortened version of the article was distributed on bulletin boards under the title &quot;The Farside Comes To Life In Oregon&quot;. However, the piece did not explain that the event had happened approximately twenty five years previously and whoever had copied Barry's article neglected to include the authorship of the piece. Dave Barry says that on a fairly regular basis someone forwards him the &quot;authorless&quot; column and suggests he write something about the described incident.(#Reference-idBarry1996|Barry 1996, pp. 164-65) Due to these oversights, an article in the ODOT's ''TranScript'' notes that



The footage that was referred to in the article, from KATU for the news story reported by Paul Linnman, resurfaced later as a video file on several websites and became a reasonably well-known and popular Internet meme.;Steven Hackstadt, [http://www.theexplodingwhale.com/#evidence The Evidence], TheExplodingWhale.com Accessed November 7 2005; [http://perp.com/whale/ The Infamous Exploding Whale] perp.com, Accessed June 6 2005).; These websites attracted criticism from upset people who complained that they were making fun of acts of animal cruelty, even though the whale was already dead. Their critical emails were subsequently published by the bemused site webmasters.

The story of Oregon's exploding whale was widely known on Usenet for quite some time and was in particular discussed on alt.folklore.urban, a newsgroup devoted to urban legends. The incident, including a complete copy of Barry's article, was recorded in the newsgroup's 1991 FAQ, then maintained by Peter van der Linden, where it was marked as &quot;Tb&quot; (believed true, but not conclusively proven).;Peter van der Linden, [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/alt.folklore.urban/msg/2311d952c25e2bd6?output=gplain Well, I'll be FAQ'ed.], Google Groups, June 28 1991.Accessed June 6 2005.; In 1992, after newsgroup poster &quot;snopes&quot; tried to verify whether this was true or not, the newsgroup received confirmation that it was a true story and marked it as true.;David P. Mikkelson, et al., [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/alt.folklore.urban/browse_frm/thread/8cca1fc876fa30ed/a93e28d689a2817c#a93e28d689a2817c Whale Blow Up], Google Groups, January 1992.Accessed June 6 2005.;

Since then, the Oregon explosion has inspired a website devoted to the incident;Hackstadt, J.; Hackstadt, S. [http://www.theexplodingwhale.com/ The exploding whale website] - definitive guide to the exploding whale of Oregon.Accessed January 8, 2007.; and has also been parodied in the second season of the Comedy Central show ''Drawn Together'', in which a group of tribesmen attempt to move the carcass of Toot Braunstein, the fattest of the show's characters, by blowing up her body.

=Tainan, Taiwan=
This whale explosion in Taiwan happened due to a natural buildup of internal gases during its transportation to a research establishment near the southwestern city of Tainan.
A second whale explosion occurred on January 26, 2004, in Tainan City, Taiwan. In this incident, a buildup of gas inside a decomposing sperm whale, measuring 17 m (55 ft 9 in) long and weighing 50 tons, caused it to burst. The older bull whale had died after becoming beached on the southwestern coast of Taiwan, and it had taken more than 13 hours, three large cranes, and 50 workers to shift the beached sperm whale onto the back of a truck.

While the whale was being moved ''Taiwan News'' reported that &quot;a large crowd of more than 600 local Yunlin residents and curiosity seekers, along with vendors selling snack food and hot drinks, braved the cold temperature and chilly wind to watch workmen try to haul away the dead marine leviathan&quot;.;Jason Pan, &quot; Sperm whale explodes in Tainan City&quot;, ''eTaiwan News'', January 27 2004 (accessed June 6 2005).; Professor Wang Chien-ping had ordered the whale be moved to the Sutsao Wild Life Reservation Area after he had been refused permission to perform a post-mortem at the National Cheng Kung University in Tainan. The whale was being transported on the back of a truck through the center of Tainan from the university laboratory to the preserve when the explosion occurred.Although the explosion was spectacular, it did not stop researchers from performing a necropsy on the animal.

The explosion was reported to have splattered blood and whale entrails over surrounding shop-fronts, bystanders, and cars. BBC News Online interviewed an unnamed Taiwanese local who said, &quot;What a stinking mess. This blood and other stuff that blew out on the road is disgusting, and the smell is really awful.&quot;;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3437455.stm &quot;Whale explodes in Taiwanese city&quot;]. ''BBC News'', January 29, 2004.Accessed January 8, 2007. ;

Over the course of about one year, Professor Wang completed a bone display from the remains of the whale's rotting dead body. The assembled specimen and some preserved organs and tissues have been on display in the Taijiang Cetacean Museum (:zh:台江鯨豚館|zh:台江鯨豚館) since April 8, 2005.

=Other incidents=
A stranded whale in Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, also decayed until it exploded. Locals say that its blubber &quot;hung in the trees for weeks.&quot;;;

Whale corpses are regularly disposed of through the use of explosion; however, the whales are usually first towed out to sea. Government-sanctioned explosions have occurred in both South Africa and Iceland. 

A number of controlled explosions have been made in South Africa. Explosives were used to kill a beached humpback whale 40 km (24 miles) west of Port Elizabeth on August 6 2001,;Timofei Byelo, &quot;[http://english.pravda.ru/accidents/2001/08/08/12005.html Explosives used to blow up whale in South Africa],&quot; ''Pravda''. (accessed June 6 2005).; while a Southern Right Whale that beached near Cape Town on 15 September 2005 was killed by authorities through detonation. In this instance authorities said that the whale could not have been saved, and that the use of explosives in such cases was recommended by the International Whaling Commission.; [http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/beached-whale-killed-with-explosives/2005/09/15/1126377408417.html &quot;Beached whale killed with explosives&quot;.] ''Sydney Morning Herald'', September 15, 2005.Accessed January 8, 2007.; A few weeks after the August 6th explosion near Port Elizabeth, the carcass of a second humpback was dragged out to sea and explosives were used to break it into pieces so it would not pose a hazard to shipping.; [http://www.dispatch.co.za/2001/08/22/easterncape/AHUMPBAC.HTM &quot;Stranded humpback dies&quot;].''Dispatch.co.za'', August 22, 2001. Accessed January 8, 2007. ; Yet another explosion was performed in Bonza Bay on September 20, 2004, when an adult humpback whale beached and died. In order to sink the whale, authorities towed it out to sea, and affixed explosives to it, later set off from a distance.; [http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/general/0,2172,88173,00.html &quot;Beached whale towed, blown up at sea&quot;.]''SABCnews.com'', September 20, 2004.Accessed January 8, 2007.; 

A whale carcass adrift in the Icelandic harbour of Hafnarfjörður was split in two by a controlled explosion on June 5, 2005. Theremains were dragged out to sea; however, they soon drifted back, and eventually had to be tied down.;[http://www.mbl.is/mm/frettir/frett.html?nid=1142126 &quot;Hvalhræ dregið út á haf og síðan aftur upp í fjöru&quot;.]mbl.is, June 5, 2005 Accessed June 6, 2005.;

In fiction
Several authors have written about exploding whales: their unusual, absurd, and improbable nature makes them a potentially interesting literary topic.
* Australian children's book author Paul Jennings wrote a book called ''Uncanny!: Even More Surprising Stories'' that features a story about a father and son being given the task of blowing up a dead whale with gelignite.

* Patrick O'Brian's short story ''Two's Company'', written in 1937, features a large whale that is washed up against an isolated lighthouse occupied by two lighthouse keepers, creating a &quot;seabird and shark feeding frenzy, not to mention an atrocious stench&quot;. The men beg for some explosives from the destroyer sent to re-supply them so they can dispose of the carcass.

* In Julian May's ''Saga of Pliocene Exile'' series, a trickster genius character named Aiken Drum blows up a beached whale-like creature on the planet Dalriada, causing messy and disgusting results.

* In ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' by Douglas Adams, while in orbit about a remote planet the ship ''Heart of Gold'', powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive, changes two nuclear missiles into a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias, which fall and create &quot;a crater about a hundred and fifty yards wide&quot; on the planet's surface.Adams was inspired to write this episode by watching the American detective drama ''Cannon''. In this, as he described it, an overweight detective killed someone at the end of each episode for no adequately explored reason. So he simply reversed the situation and had a whale killed for no adequately explored reason.

* In the mockumentary ''Reno 911!: Miami'', the officers face a rotting beached whale which they promptly blow-up with dynamite. Subsequently, raining whale blubber pelts the characters and they are later reprimanded after the whale parts are reported to have damaged boats in the area.

* A recording of Paul Linnman's coverage of the Oregon whale explosion was used in the song &quot;Disconnect (No Respectable Seagull)&quot; by Chicago band Atombombpocketknife. The song takes its title from &quot;the seagulls, who were supposed to clean things up, were nowhere in sight, either scared away by the explosion or kept away by the smell … the remaining chunks were of such a size that no respectable seagull would attempt to tackle anyway&quot;.
