Yamashita Yoshiaki

Yamashita Yoshiaki (山下 義韶, 16 February 1865&amp;ndash;26 October 1935, also known as Yamashita Yoshitsugu), was the first person to have been awarded 10th degree black belt (''Dan_rank|jūdan'') rank in Kodokan judo. He was also a pioneer of judo in the United States.

In February 1902, a Seattle-based railroad executive named Samuel Hill decided that his 9-year-old son, James Nathan, should learn judo, which he had apparently seen or heard about while on a business trip to Japan. In Hill's words, the idea was for the boy to learn &quot;the ideals of the Samurai class, for that class of men is a noble, high-minded class. They look beyond the modern commercial spirit.&quot;;Tuhy, John E. ''Sam Hill: The Prince of Castle Nowhere''. Beaverton, Oregon: Timber Press, 1983, p. 71.; Hill spoke to a Issei_Japanese_American|Japanese American business associate, Masajiro Furuya,;Gary Iwamoto, &quot;Rise &amp; Fall of an Empire&quot;, ''International Examiner'', September 6, 2005.; for advice. Furuya referred Hill to Kazuyoshi Shibata, who was a student at Yale University. Shibata told Hill about Yamashita, and on July 21, 1903, Hill wrote a letter to Yamashita, asking him to come to Seattle at Hill's expense.;Letter from Sam Hill to Y. Yamashita dated 21st Jul 1903, in Maryhill Museum of Art collection.; On August 26, 1903, Yamashita replied, writing that he, his wife, and one of his students (Saburo Kawaguchi) would leave for Seattle on September 22, 1903.;Letter from Y. Yamashita to Sam Hill dated 26th August, 1903, in Maryhill Museum of Art collection.; 

The ship carrying the Yamashita party docked in Seattle on October 8, 1903.;&quot;List or Manifest of Alien Passengers for the U.S. Immigration Officer at Port of Arrival,&quot; SS Shinano Maru, October 8, 1903, in National Archives and Record Administraion microfilm roll M1383, &quot;Passenger and Crew Lists of Vessels Arriving at Seattle, Washington, 1890-1957,&quot; Roll 2 (Apr. 17, 1900, SS GOODWIN - Jan. 17, 1904, SS TOSA MARU).; A week later, on October 17, 1903, Yamashita and Kawaguchi gave a judo exhibition at a Seattle theater that Hill had rented for the evening. Attendance was by invitation only, and guests included Sam Hill's mother-in-law, Mary Hill (wife of railroader James_J._Hill|J.J. Hill), United_States_Senate|Senator Russell Alger, and assorted sportswriters.;''Seattle Post-Intelligencer,'' October 25, 1903.;Afterwards, Hill took the Yamashita party east to Washington, D.C., where Mrs. Hill and young James Nathan were then living. Meanwhile, the favorable publicity surrounding the event caused Japanese Americans living in Seattle to start their own judo club, known as the Seattle Dojo.

Soon after arriving in the District of Columbia, Yamashita visited the Japanese Legation, and in March 1904, the Japanese naval military attaché|attaché, Commander Takeshita Isamu, took Yamashita to the White House to meet President Theodore Roosevelt.;Roosevelt, Theodore. ''Theodore Roosevelt's Letters to His Children,'' Joseph Bucklin Bishop, ed. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1919, pp. 113-114.; Roosevelt practiced wrestling and boxing while in the White House, and he had received jujutsu jackets from William Sturgis Bigelow;Brousse, Michel and David Matsumoto. ''Judo in the U.S.: A Century of Dedication.'' Berkeley, California: North Atlantic Books, 2005, pp. 23-24.; and jujutsu lessons from J. J. O'Brien, a Philadelphia police officer who had studied jujutsu while living in Nagasaki.;''New York World,'' October 26, 1902.;;Anonymous. &quot;Training the Helpless Flapper to Fight Her Own Battles,&quot; ''Literary Digest,'' August 27, 1927, p. 47.;;Earns, Lane. &quot;Nagasaki Kyoruchi no Seiyojin (Westerners of the Nagasaki Foreign Settlement)&quot;.[http://www.uwosh.edu/cols/StaffBooks/earns.htm]; Roosevelt was impressed with Yamashita's skill, and during March and April 1904, Yamashita gave judo lessons to the President and interested family and staff in a room at the White House.;''New York Sun'', April 17, 1904.;;Svinth, Joseph R. &quot;Professor Yamashita Goes to Washington.&quot;[http://ejmas.com/jcs/jcsart_svinth1_1000.htm]; Subsequently, at other locations, Yamashita and his wife Fude gave lessons to prominent American women, to include Martha Blow Wadsworth (sister of Kindergarten pioneer Susan Blow), Hallie Elkins (wife of United_States_Senate|Senator Stephen Benton Elkins), and Grace Davis Lee (Hallie Elkins' sister), and their children.;&quot;Jiu-Jitsu for Women,&quot; ''Sandow's Magazine,'' December 7, 1905, with annotations by Joseph R. Svinth.[http://ejmas.com/jalt/jaltart_sandow's_0800.htm] Despite what one sometimes reads,[http://www.judoinfo.com/greats.htm] Grace Davis Lee was not related to General Robert E. Lee.;

In January 1905, Yamashita got a job teaching judo at the U.S. Naval Academy. There were about 25 students in his class, including a future admiral, Robert L. Ghormley.;''Army and Navy Journal'', March 25, 1905.; The position ended at the end of the school term, and Yamashita was not rehired for the following year.;Sweetman, Jack. ''The U.S. Naval Academy: An Illustrated History,'' 2d edition, revised by Thomas J. Cutler. Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Academy Press, 1995, p. 269.; When President Roosevelt heard of this, he spoke to the Charles_Joseph_Bonaparte|Secretary of the Navy, who in turn told the James_H._Sands|Superintendent of the Naval Academy to rehire Yamashita.;Memorandum from Charles J. Bonaparte, Secretary of the Navy, to Chief, Bureau of Navigation, dated November 3, 1905, in US Naval Academy archives.; Consequently, Yamashita's judo was taught at the Naval Academy throughout the first six months of 1906.;Letter from Superintendent of Naval Academy to Chief of Bureau of Navigation, Navy Department, dated May 4, 1906, in US Naval Academy Archives.;

Later life

At the end of the 1906 academic year, Yamashita left the United States for Japan.;Letter from Imperial Japanese Embassy to the Bureau of Navigation, The Navy Department, dated December 19, 1906, in US Naval Academy archives.;On July 24, 1906, he participated in a conference in Kyoto that had been called for the purpose of standardizing judo forms (''kata'') that could be taught in Japanese public schools. Subsequently, he was employed as a judo teacher at .;Svinth, Joseph R. &quot;Professor Yamashita Goes to Washington.&quot;[http://ejmas.com/jcs/jcsart_svinth1_1000.htm]; An example of Yamashita's teaching method is the advice:;&quot;Do's and Don'ts in Learning Judo by Yoshiaki Yamashita,&quot; JudoInfo.com.[http://www.judoinfo.com/yoshiaki.htm];



From the 1910s until the mid-1930s, Yamashita often attended judo tournaments and exhibitions.;For a description of such an event in Kobe in 1925, see Frank O'Neill, &quot;The Brown Man in the Field of Sports,&quot; ''The Ring,'' November 1925, p. 19.; His last major public appearance was probably the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Kodokan, an event which took place in November 1934. British judoka Sarah Mayer described Yamashita's participation as follows:;Letter from Sarah Mayer to Gunji Koizumi dated November 27, 1934.[http://www.judoinfo.com/mayer.htm][http://ejmas.com/jcs/jcsart_mayer1_0200.htm];



His ultimate promotion to 10th ''dan'' was posthumous.;
