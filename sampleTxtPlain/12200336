Views

He denied that the Bible was the Word of God;Hill, ''The English Bible and the Seventeenth-Century Revolution'' (1993) p. 234.;, and that Christ was more divine than other men;Hill, ''Milton and the English Revolution'' (1977), p. 293.;. He considered that the real Devil lay in human nature;[http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:uGtsb5V3s4MJ:www.isaac-newton.org/devil.doc+%22Jacob+Bauthumley%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=19&amp;gl=uk];, while God dwells in the flesh of man;Hill, Milton, p. 301.;.

E. P. Thompson calls his views 'quasi-pantheistic' in their re-definition of God and Christ, and quotes A. L. Morton to the effect that this is the central Ranter doctrine;''Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law'' (1993), p. 26.;.
