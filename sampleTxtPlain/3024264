''Les Amants de Montparnasse'', (''The Lovers of Montparnasse''), also known as ''Montparnasse 19'', is a French/Italian film chronicling the last year of the life of the Italian painter Amedeo Modigliani who worked and died in abject poverty in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, France. The film project was initiated by Max Ophüls who died before the script could be completed, so his name was credited as dedicatee.

The film poster, as seen here, billed the film as ''&quot;Montparnasse 19&quot;'', but it is credited as ''&quot;Les Amants de Montparnasse (Montparnasse 19)&quot;''.
