James &quot;Jim&quot; McCartney (July 7, 1902 &amp;ndash; March 18, 1976) and Mary Patricia McCartney (née Mohan) (September 29, 1909 &amp;ndash; October 31, 1956) were the parents of musician, author and artist Paul McCartney, best known for his work in The Beatles and Wings, and photographer and musician Mike McCartney, who worked with The Scaffold.

Like many families in Liverpool, the McCartney and Mohan families are from Irish descent. Jim worked for most of his life in the cotton trade, as well as playing in ragtime and jazz bands in Liverpool, while Mary was a trained nurse and midwife. 

The McCartney family lived in council houses during Mary's life, but Paul later bought his father a house called Rembrandt, in Heswall, Cheshire. Jim encouraged his two sons to take up music by buying instruments for them to learn, as well as improving their status in life through education. Mary was Paul's inspiration for the song, &quot;Let It Be&quot;. After Mary’s death, Jim married Angela Williams and adopted her daughter from a previous marriage, Ruth McCartney.

Mary's father was born in Tullynamalrow, County Monaghan, Ireland, in 1880, as Owen Mohin, but permanently changed his name to Mohan when he was at school to avoid confusion with many other pupils called Mohin. He was working as a Trolley (horse-drawn)|coalman when he married Mary Theresa Danher from Toxteth Park, at St. Charles Roman Catholic Church, on 24 April 1905.;

Marriage

Mary met her future husband during an air raid on Liverpool in 1940, when Jim was 40-years-old, and had settled into what his friends thought was, &quot;a confirmed bachelorhood.&quot; Mary had been too career-conscious to think of marriage and, at 31-years-old, was thought of as a spinster.; Spitz 2005 p73.; They met in June 1940, at 11 Scargreen Avenue, West Derby, as the McCartney family had gathered to celebrate the wedding of Jim's sister, Jin, to Harry Harris. Mary was staying with Harris family because of the lack of accommodation in Liverpool at the time.; Spitz 2005 p72.; During the celebration, Mary sat quietly in an armchair, until the air-raid sirens sounded at 9:30. At that time, the group moved to the cellars to wait for the all-clear, but as there was an intensive bombing raid, the message did not come. Everyone was thus forced to sit in the cellar until dawn. Mary talked long enough with Jim to become romantically interested in him, and thought that he was &quot;utterly charming and uncomplicated,&quot; as well as being entertained by his &quot;considerable good humour.&quot;; Spitz 2005 p73.; They took out a marriage licence at Liverpool Town Hall on 8 April 1941, and were married a week later at St. Swithin’s Roman Catholic chapel in Gillmoss, West Derby, on 15 April 1941.; Spitz 2005 p75.; They first lived at 10 Sunbury Road, Liverpool, and then resided for a short time at 92 Broadway, Wallasey, during November 1942.

So that got me writing 'Let It Be'.&quot;; Miles 1997 p20.;;

In 1974, Paul collaborated with father Jim to create a song entitled &quot;Walking in the Park with Eloise&quot;, a very upbeat tune, and was released by Paul McCartney &amp; Wings under the pseudonym &quot;The Country Hams&quot;. The Country Hams' single was backed with a tune entitled &quot;Bridge on the River Suite&quot;. Both songs can be found on the CD ''Wings at the Speed of Sound'' from The Paul McCartney Collection.
