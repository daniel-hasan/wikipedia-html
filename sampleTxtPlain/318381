South Ossetia (Ossetian: Хуссар Ирыстон, ''Khussar Iryston''; , ''Samkhret Oseti''; , ''Yuzhnaya Osetiya'') was an autonomous oblast of Georgia in Soviet times. Now the greater part of it is controlled by the government of the ''de facto'' independent South Ossetian Republic which is not recognised by any country or international organisation (UN, OSCE, EU, etc). Another part of South Ossetia is controlled by the Georgian government. Georgia does not recognise South Ossetia as a distinct or independent entity. However in April of 2007, the Georgian government created a temporary administrative unit (Provisional Administrative Entity of South Ossetia ;http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=15080;) headed by ethnic Ossetians (former members of separatist government) which would enable Tbilisi to administer the region through local leaders, negotiate with Ossetian authorities regarding its final status and conflict resolution.;http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=14865;

Political status
The United Nations, European Union, OSCE, Council of the European Union, NATO and most of the countries around the world recognize South Ossetia as an integral part of the Georgian state and its constitution. However, the de facto independent republic governed by the secessionist government has held a second independence referendum;; on November 12, 2006, after its first referendum in 1992 was not recognized by the international community as valid.;http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=13522;. As expected the referendum turned out a majority for independence from Georgia. However, it was not recognized internationally by the UN, European Union, OSCE, NATO and the Russian Federation, given the lack of ethnic Georgian participation and the legality of such referendum without recognition from the central government in Tbilisi.;http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/13/sossetia.independence.ap/index.html ; The European Union, OSCE, NATO and the USA condemned the referendum. Parallel to the secessionist held referendum and elections, the Ossetian opposition movement (The Salvation Union of South Ossetia) to Kokoity, organised their own elections in which both Georgian and some Ossetian inhabitants of the region voted in favour of Dmitri Sanakoev as the alternative President of South Ossetia.;http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=279 ; The alternative elections of Sanakoev claimed full support of the ethnic Georgian population.
In 2007, Dmitri Sanakoev became the head of the Provisional Administration of South Ossetia.

On July 13, 2007, Georgia set up a state commission, chaired by the Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli, to develop South Ossetia's autonomous status within the Georgian state. According to the Georgian officials, the status will be elaborated within the framework of &quot;an all-inclusive dialogue&quot; with all the forces and communities within the Ossetian society.;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=15431 Commission to Work on S.Ossetia Status]. ''Civil Georgia'' July 13, 2007.;

History
=Medieval and early modern period=
The Ossetians are originally descendants of Iranian-speaking tribes from Eurasian Steppes. They became Christians during the early Middle Ages, under Georgian influence. Under Mongol rule, they were pushed out of their medieval homeland south of the Don river in present-day Russia and part migrated towards and over the Caucasus mountains, to Georgia; David Marshall Lang, The Georgians, New York, p. 239 ; where they formed three distinct territorial entities. Digor in the west came under the influence of the neighboring Kabard people, who introduced Islam. Tualläg in the south became what is now South Ossetia, part of the historical Georgian principality of Samachablo;Roger Rosen, History of Caucasus Nations, London, 2006 ; where Ossetians found refuge from Mongol invaders. Iron in the north became what is now North Ossetia, under Russian rule from 1767. Most Ossetians are now Christian (approximately 61%); there is also a significant Muslim minority.

=South Ossetia under Russia and the Soviet Union=
The modern-day South Ossetia was annexed by Russia in 1801, along with Georgia proper, and absorbed into the Russian Empire. Following the Russian Revolution, South Ossetia became a part of the Menshevik Georgian Democratic Republic, while the north became a part of the Terek Soviet Republic. The area Georgian-Ossetian conflict (1918-1920)|saw brief clashes between the Georgian governmental forces and Ossetians led by Ossetian and Georgian bolsheviks in 1920.
The Soviet Georgian government established by the Russian 11th Red Army in 1921, created the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast (i.e. district) in April 1922. Although the Ossetians had their own language (Ossetian), Russianand Georgianwere administrative/state languages.; D.M. Lang, History of Modern Georgia, 1963 ; At present, Russian is the only administrative language used by the separatist government in Tskhinvali. In the Soviet time, under the rule of Georgia's government, it enjoyed some degree of autonomy, including to practice (Ossetian) language and teach it in schools.; D.M. Lang, History of Modern Georgia, 1963 ;

=Georgian-Ossetian conflict=

South Ossetia detailed map
The tensions in the region began to rise amid the rising nationalism among both Georgians and Ossetians in 1989. Prior to this, the two communities of the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast of Georgian SSR had been living in peace with each other except for the episode in 1920. Both ethnicities have had a high level of interaction and high rates of intermarriages.

In the same year, the influential South Ossetian Popular Front (''Ademon Nykhas'') demanded unification with North Ossetia as a measure to defend Ossetian autonomy. On 10 November 1989, the South Ossetian Supreme Soviet approved a decision to unite South Ossetia with the North Ossetian ASSR, part of Russia. A day later, the Georgian parliament revoked the decision and abolished South Ossetian autonomy. Additionally, the parliament authorized the suppression of newspapers and demonstrations.

According to a TIME Magazine January 1991 article, ''“Last September ''(of 1990)'', as the rest of Georgia was moving toward independence, the South Ossetian regional council declared the area to be a &quot;Soviet Democratic Republic&quot; loyal to Moscow. The parliament in Tbilisi responded by dissolving the autonomous region altogether. Conflicts between the Georgian police and local separatists have resulted in at least 12 deaths.”'';[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972214,00.html Hastening The End of the Empire], ''TIME Magazine'', January 28, 1991;

Following Georgia's independence in 1991 under the nationalist leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the Georgian government declared Georgian to be the only administrative language throughout the country. Throughout the Soviet era Georgian, along with Russian, were the state and administrative languages, since it was stipulated as such in both the 1936 and 1979 constitutions of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. This caused great concern in South Ossetia, whose leaders demanded that Ossetian become the language of their state. The Ossetian minority continued to seek greater levels of autonomy, but were faced with increasing nationalist sentiment among the Georgian majority. Violent conflict broke out towards the end of 1991 during which many South Ossetian villages were attacked and burned down as well as Georgian houses and schools in Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia. As a result, approximately 1,000 died and about 100,000 ethnic Ossetians fled the territory and Georgia proper, most across the border into North Ossetia. A further 23,000 ethnic Georgians fled South Ossetia and settled in other parts of Georgia.; Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, [http://hrw.org/reports/1996/Russia.htm RUSSIA. THE INGUSH-OSSETIAN CONFLICT IN THE PRIGORODNYI REGION], May 1996.; Many South Ossetians were resettled in uninhabited areas of North Ossetia from which the Ingush had been expelled by Stalin in 1944, leading to conflicts between Ossetians and Ingush over the right of residence in former Ingush territory.
The monument to the victims of the Georgian-Ossetian conflict in Tskhinvali

It should be noted that at the time of the dissolution of the USSR, the United States government recognized as legitimate the pre-Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact 1933 borders of the country (the Franklin D. Roosevelt government established diplomatic relations with the Kremlin at the end of that year;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746345,00.html &quot;Pretty Fat Turkey&quot;], ''TIME Magazine'', November 27, 1933 ;). Because of this, the George H. Bush administration openly supported the secession of the Baltic SSRs, but regarded the questions related to the independence and territorial conflicts of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and the rest of the Transcaucasus — which were integral part of the USSR with international borders unaltered since the 1920s — as internal Soviet affairs.;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973116,00.html America Abroad], ''TIME Magazine'', June 10, 1991;

In 1992, Georgia was forced to accept a ceasefire to avoid a large scale confrontation with Russia. The government of Georgia and South Ossetian separatists reached an agreement to avoid the use of force against one another, and Georgia pledged not to impose sanctions against South Ossetia. However, the Georgian government still retains control over substantial portions of South Ossetia.;[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10225052&amp;CFID=23834221&amp;CFTOKEN=38924298 The independence precedent: If Kosovo goes free]; A peacekeeping force of Ossetians, Russians and Georgians was established. On November 6 1992, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) set up a Mission in Georgia to monitor the peacekeeping operation. From then, until mid-2004 South Ossetia was generally peaceful. In June 2004, tensions began to rise as the Georgian authorities strengthened their efforts against smuggling in the region.; Hostage takings, shootouts and occasional bombings left dozens dead and wounded. A ceasefire deal was reached on August 13 though it was repeatedly violated. Presently the situation is tense though largely peaceful, although Moscow and Tskhinvali view the recent Georgian military build-up with concern. The Georgian government protests against the continually increasing Russian economic and political presence in the region, as well as the uncontrolled military of the South Ossetian side. It also considers the peacekeeping force to be non-neutral and demanded its replacement.;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=11833 Resolution on Peacekeepers Leaves Room for More

Politics


The Republic of South Ossetia consists of a checkerboard of Georgian-inhabited and Ossetian-inhabited towns and villages. The largely Ossetian capital city of Tskhinvali and most of the other Ossetian-inhabited communities are governed by the separatist government, while the Georgian-inhabited villages and towns are administered by the Georgian government. This close proximity and the intermixing of the two communities has made the conflict in South Ossetia particularly dangerous, since any attempt to create an ethnically pure territory would necessarily have to involve population transfers on a large scale.

The political dispute has, yet to be resolved and the South Ossetian separatist authorities govern the region with effective independence from Tbilisi. Although talks have been held periodically between the two sides, little progress was made under the government of Eduard Shevardnadze (1993–2003). His successor Mikheil Saakashvili (elected 2004) made the reassertion of Georgian governmental authority a political priority. Having successfully put an end to the ''de facto'' independence of the southwestern province of Ajaria in May 2004, he pledged to seek a similar solution in South Ossetia. After the 2004 clashes, the Georgian government has intensified its efforts to bring the problem to international attention. On January 25 2005, President Saakashvili presented a Georgian vision for resolving the South Ossetian conflict at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) session in Strasbourg. Late in October, the U.S. Government and the OSCE expressed their support to the Georgian action plan presented by Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli at the OSCE Permanent Council at Vienna on October 27, 2005. On December 6, the OSCE Ministerial Council in Ljubljana adopted a resolution supporting the Georgian peace plan ;OSCE, 13th Meeting of the Ministerial Council (5 and 6 December 2005). Statement on Georgia (MC.DOC/4/05); which was subsequently rejected by the South Ossetian ''de facto'' authorities.

=De facto authorities in Tskhinvali=

On August 26 2006, the high-ranking delegation of the United States Senators led by the Arizona Senator John McCain paid a visit to the Georgian-Ossetian conflict zone. The group visited Tskhinvali and met with the de facto leader Eduard Kokoity. Speaking about his visit to Tskhinvali, Senator McCain said that the trip was &quot;not very productive.&quot; Senator McCain said:



On September 11, 2006, the South Ossetian Information and Press Committee announced that the republic will hold an independence referendum;; (the first referendumhad not been recognized by the international community as valid in 1992;Civil Georgia, [S.Ossetia Sets Repeat Independence Referendum http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=13522], 2006-09-11;) on November 12, 2006. The voters would decide on whether or not South Ossetia &quot;should preserve its present de facto status of an independent state&quot;. Georgia denounced the move as a &quot;political absurdity&quot;. However, On September 13 2006, the Council of Europe (CoE) Secretary General Terry Davis commented on the problem, stating that it would be unlikely if anyone accepted the results of this referendum and instead urged South Ossetian government to engage in the negotiations with Georgia.;[http://portal.coe.ge/enews/EEVlEuyFElfTRjjwgP.php ''Council of Europe Secretary General calls for talks instead of &quot;referendum&quot; in the Georgian region of South Ossetia.''] Council of Europe Information Office in Georgia. Retrieved on 13-09-2006.; On September 13 2006 EU Special Representative to the South Caucasus, Peter Semneby, while visiting Moscow, said: &quot;''results of the South Ossetian independence referendum will have no meaning for the European Union''&quot;.;http://207.44.135.100/eng/article.php?id=13544; Peter Semneby also added that this referendum will not contribute to the peaceful conflict resolution process in South Ossetia

South Ossetians nearly unanimously approved a referendum on November 12, 2006 opting for independence from Georgia. The referendum was hugely popular, winning between 98 and 99 percent of the ballots, flag waving and celebration marked were seen across South Ossetia, but elsewhere observers were less enthusiastic.International critics claimed that the move could worsen regional tensions, and the Tblisi government thoroughly discounted the results.; -->;
On November 13, Terry Davis, head of the 46-nation Council of Europe, called the referendum on &quot;independence&quot; as &quot;unnecessary, unhelpful and unfair&quot; because ethnic Georgians were not given the right to vote in it.;Radio Free Europe, [Overwhelming Support For South Ossetia Independence http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/11/20251a3b-47b6-4f6d-9400-14d721a34d34.html], November 13, 2006;
On the other handRussia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs described it as a &quot;free expression of the will of South Ossetia’s people through democratic procedures&quot; and stated that the referendum's results must be taken into account by the international community.;Interfax, November 10, 12-14, retrieved from [http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2371648 MOSCOW’S FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER SOUTH OSSETIA’S REFERENDUM] by Vladimir Socor, November 15, 2006;

=Provisional Administration of South Ossetia=
The Salvation Union of South Ossetia was founded in October of 2006 by the ethnic Ossetians who were outspoken critics and presented a serious opposition to secessionist authorities of Eduard Kokoity. 

The group headed by the former defence minister and then prime minister of secessionist government Dmitri Sanakoev organized the so-called alternative presidential election, on November 12 2006– parallel to those held by the secessionist authorities in Tskhinvali.;http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=279 ; High voter turnout was reported by the alternative electoral commission, which estimated over 42,000 voters from both Ossetian (Java district and Tskhinvali) and Georgian (Eredvi, Tamarasheni, etc) communities of South Ossetia and Sanakoev reportedly received 96% of the votes. Another referendum was organised shortly after asking for the start of negotiations with Georgia on a federal arrangement for South Ossetia received 94% support. However the Salvation Union of South Ossetia turned down a request from a Georgian NGO, “Multinational Georgia”, to monitor it and the released results were very likely to be inflated.;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=4887&amp;l=1 Georgia’s South Ossetia Conflict: Make Haste Slowly], Europe Report N°183, 7 June 2007 (free registration needed to view full report);

“I, the President of the Republic of South Ossetia, declare before God and Nation that I will protect the interests of the South Ossetian people... I will take care of the security, well-being and revival of South Ossetia and its people,” 

Dimitri Sanakoev said in his presidential oath, which he gave in the Ossetian and Georgian languages during the inauguration ceremony held on December 1 2006.;http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=14224;
;
Soon after Sanakoev formed his government, appointing Uruzmag Karkusov as Prime Minister, Jemal Karkusov (former Interior Minister in the secessionist government) as Interior Minister and Maia Chigoeva-Tsaboshvili (head of the Tbilisi-based non-governmental organization Iber-Ironi Georgian-Ossetian Union) as Foreign Minister.;http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=14223 ;

“This is a historic day. A year ago no one could imagine that South Ossetian flags could appear here in the Georgian-populated village,” Vladimir Sanakoev, co-founder of the Salvation Union of South Ossetia, said.;http://www.civil.ge/eng/detail.php?id=14224;

There were large number of Ossetian flags also used by the South Ossetian secessionist authorities, flown alongside the Georgian flag in Kurta, near Tskhinvali. South Ossetian flags are usually displayed in Tskhinvali by the Separatist controlled territories of the breakaway region alongside of the Russian national flag.

Despite Georgia's non-violent and development-oriented steps, both the central Georgian government and Sanakoyev's adminsitartion considers any negotiations with Kokoity's government meaningless because of its dependence on Moscow. On the other hand, the Tskhinvali leadership and a majority of South Ossetians in the areas it controls dismiss Sanakoev as a &quot;traitor&quot; and perceive that Georgia wants to force a settlement on its own terms having &quot;little respect for their aspirations and fears&quot;.; 

Initially the entity of Sanakoev was known as &quot;the Alternative Government of South Ossetia&quot;, but during the course of 2007 the central authorities of Georgia decided to give it official status and on April 13 the formation of &quot;Provisional Administration of South Ossetia&quot; was announced. ;http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=14944; On May 10, 2007 Dmitry Sanakoev was appointed head of the provisional administrative entity in South Ossetia. ;http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=15089;

For the first time since the fall of Soviet Union, the former Ossetian secessionist leader gave a speech in the Georgian parliament on May 11, 2007. 

In his speech in Ossetian language ([http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=15101seefull text]), Sanakoev mentioned about the armed conflict which ignited the region in early 90s:

He also mentioned that:

Sanakoev also mentioned that despite of his high-level position in the South Ossetian secessionist authorities as Prime Minister he failed to build confidence between the two sides and make a breakthrough in the conflict resolution process “because it was beyond my powers.”
.
As for current situation, Sakanoev mentioned that Tskhinvali secessionist authorities take instruction from “foreign supervisors” who try to thwart confidence-building and provoke hostilities between the two people.

&quot;''Our Ossetian children grow up in an environment of endless conflict, under constant stress and tension… They don’t know what is going on beyond checkpoints… We are losing entire generations'',”“''I will not allow it! We should not allow it'',” he added. “''This is our current challenge; this is our current goal: to create a new Ossetia, strong and delightful, free of violence: an Ossetia of free people''.”

Many European and US observers and ambassadors who were present during Sanakoevs speech, welcomed his proposition and initiatives. On June 15, 2007 European Union, European Parliament and OSCE supported Georgian initiative for conflict settlement in South Ossetia. EU issued the following statement:

&quot;The EU welcomes the Georgian government’s invitation to the South Ossetian society as a whole – i.e. representatives of all political forces and local groups – to participate actively in discussions on progress towards peaceful conflict resolution.” ;http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=15289;

On June 26 of 2007 Dmitry Sanakoev delivered a speech in European Parliament which was assessed by European delegates as historic. The speech lasted for 30 minutes and entirely in Ossetian language which set a precedent for the European Union. Most of the European diplomats and members of EU parliament welcomed Sanakoev initiatives and supported his peace plan for South Ossetia. Prior to this, the EU mission had met with both Sanakoev and Kokoity in January, 2007. Per Eklund, Head of the European Commission Delegation to Georgia said that “None of the two alternatives do we consider legitimate [in South Ossetia],” ;http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=14488;

In August of 2007, Kokoity Fandarast political campaign was launched by the The Salvation Union of South Ossetia and Vladimir Sanakoev, with a declared goal &quot;of getting rid of Eduard Kokoity.&quot;

Geography
South Ossetia covers an area of about 3,900 km² on the southern side of the Caucasus, separated by the mountains from the more populous North Ossetia (part of Russia) and extending southwards almost to the Mtkvari river in Georgia. It is extremely mountainous, with most of the region lying over 1,000 m (3,300 ft) above sea level. Its economy is primarily agricultural, although less than 10% of South Ossetia's land area is cultivated, with cereals, fruit and vines the major produce. Forestry and cattle industries are also maintained. A number of industrial facilities also exist, particularly around the capital Tskhinvali.

Demographics
Before the Georgian-Ossetian conflict about two thirds of the population of South Ossetia were Ossetians and 25-30% Georgians. The present composition of the population is unknown,although according to some estimates there are 45,000 ethnic Ossetians and 17,500 ethnic Georgians in South Ossetia in 2007.; The Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use.

Economy
Following a war with Georgia in the 1990s, South Ossetia has struggled economically. Employment and supplies are scarce. Additionally, Georgia cut off supplies of electricity to the region, which forced the South Ossetian government to run an electric cable through North Ossetia. The majority of the population survives on subsistence farming. Virtually the only significant economic asset that South Ossetia possesses is control of the Roki Tunnel that links Russia and Georgia, from which the South Ossetian government reportedly obtains as much as a third of its budget by levying customs duties on freight traffic. The separatist officials admitted that Tskhinvali received more than 60 percent of its 2006 budget revenue directly from the Russian government.;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2007/07/26/016.html Money the Big Attraction in S.
