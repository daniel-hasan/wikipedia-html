The battle started on August 13 2001 as the rebels seized the village of Benoi-Yurt in south-east Chechnya, attacked the local military commandant's office, and placed checkpoints on a strategic road that leads further south to the town of Vedeno. Pro-Moscow administrators were reported killed.

Russian presidential spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky called the latest developments &quot;an imitation of activity by the gangs.&quot;
