''Still Game'' is a Scottish sitcom, a spin-off from the sketch show series ''Chewin' the Fat''. . Originally beginning as a stage play, it was created by ''Chewin' The Fats Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill, who also play the lead characters, despite being much younger than the characters' ages. It is produced by The Comedy Unit with the BBC. Since it debuted on September 1st, 2002, ''Still Game'' has shown forty one episodes, including a Christmas and Hogmanay special.

The title refers to the antics of two Glaswegian pensioners named Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade. Set in Craiglang, a fictional district of Glasgow, the show follows the lives of Jack, Victor and their various friends. The show started its first series being broadcast on BBC One Scotland; the further two series followed suit. It was not until the Still Game#Series 4 (2005)|fourth series that ''Still Game'' was given a UK-wide broadcast on BBC Two. Since then, the show has gained favourable critical reviews and attracted many fans, achieving higher ratings than the following comedy shows broadcast during the BBC Two Comedy Zone. 

History
The stage play of ''Still Game''
''Still Game'' was originally a stage play featuring the characters of Jack Jarvis, Victor McDade and Winston Ingram; the three were retained for the show. In this version, due to a broken lift, the three old men are stranded in Victor's flat, where they discuss a variety of subjects ranging from death to sex. The stage play toured Scotland, England, Ireland and Canada before returning to Glasgow, where it was filmed and released on video and DVD.

Many changes occurred when the play made its transition to television. Gavin Mitchell, who originally played Winston (and was replaced with Paul Riley for later performances), now plays the part of Boaby the Barman in the television series. Later television characters Tam Mullen and Isa Drennan are also mentioned in the play but with differences to their counterparts. Notably, Winston refers to his home help catching him dancing in the bookies, a scene that would later be re-used for series two of the show.

In 1998, characters Jack and Victor appeared in a tongue-in-cheek documentary about Scottish pop music called ''Och Around the Clock'', presented by Dougie Vipond. They appeared in a number of skits spread throughout the show, in which they wereshown to be watching the show in Victor's flat. In a similar manner to the Muppet characters of Statler and Waldorf, the skit centred on them making disparaging comments about the performers.

The characters were then featured in Kiernan and Hemphill's sketch show ''Chewin' the Fat''. Nearly every episode of ''Chewin' The Fat'' featured Jack, Victor, Tam and Winston (although until the 4th series they looked different from their Still Game appearance) singing in the pub, usually accompanied with another sketch featuring just Jack and Victor. However, Winston also features in two other sketches with Tam appearing in one, where he is introduced by Winston as a thief. By the time ''Still Game'' was thought of as its own show, Winston's appearance had been drastically changed but was still played by Paul Riley. As the show progressed into later series, characters such as Winston, Isa and the local shopkeeper, Navid Harrid have become more popular.

Even though they started their first series, Jack and Victor made their final appearance on Chewin' the Fat in the 2002 Hogmanay Special.

The sixth series ended on August 23, 2007 on BBC Two. A Christmas Special was aired on BBC One Scotland on 23rd December at 10:15pm. It was aired to the rest of the UK on BBC Two on 28 December at 10:50pm. There was also a Hogmanay special called &quot;Hootenanny&quot; aired on BBC One Scotland at 11:15pm on Hogmanay. It is aired to the rest of the UK on BBC Two on 2 January 2008 at 10pm.

Filming locations
The local pub, Jenny's, as seen in ''&quot;Hard Nuts&quot;''.
Although ''Still Game'' is set in the fictional Craiglang area of Glasgow, the Maryhill district of the city is one of the most common filming locations. The shops featured in the series can be found in the Townhead area of Glasgow. The Forth and Clyde Canal and its locks are used in background shots, as are the high-rise tower blocks, including the one in which Jack and Victor live called &quot;Osprey Heights&quot;. For the first three series of the show, a real pub (&quot;The Gimlet&quot;) in Ruchill was used to film the exterior shots of the pub Jenny's, previously The Clansman. However, between series three and four, the owner of the pub tore the building down, causing the fourth series production team to build an exterior in a set in Dumbarton, the same lot where ''River City'' is filmed. Scene interiors (Jack and Victor's flat, hallways and the interior of Navid's shop are specially constructed sets, built within a warehouse complex, now a Maryhill industrial estate (and called Craigmont Studios).

Finport, as mentioned and seen in the fifth series, was actually filmed on location in Largs and Saltcoats, North Ayrshire, both of which were once popular seaside resorts with Glaswegians. The shots of the promenade and the sea wall is that of Saltcoats' harbour area. The cafe that Jack and Victor walk past is The Melbourne Cafe in Saltcoats. The pub scene is set in the Royal Oak pub in Largs, while the bed and breakfast, where Jack and Victor stay the night in, is located in the north end of Largs promenade. In the scene where Jack and Victor arrive on the bus from the right in Finport this actually leads from the sea, there is no road there. In the scene where Jack and Victor find Winston, a wide panning shot reveals the famous Nardini ice-cream building and the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry to Millport.

Series summaries


For the show's first three series, the broadcast of ''Still Game'' was limited to BBC One Scotland. The show was then moved to BBC Two for the fourth series and shown throughout the UK. On December 28 2005, ''Still Games first Christmas special was shown on BBC One, the first national broadcast of the show on the channel. A fifth series of the show started filming in February 2006 and was shown the following June on BBC Two. As of 2006, series three had not been shown nationally, and only five episodes from the first two series were shown on national BBC Two from 17 January to 14 February 2004.

In the first three series, the episode titles were all Scots language words that were related to the episode. Starting from season four, the episodes were titled using standard English so that general audiences could understand them.

The events of ''Still Game'' take place in a floating timeline where the characters remain the same age from series to series. One of the most prominent examples of this is that Victor reveals that he is 74 years old in ''Scran'', an episode of the second series, but it is not until the fifth series (''Smoke On The Water'') that he celebrates his 75th birthday.
