Main building of the Jewish community, housing the tempel in the Seitenstettengasse 4
The Stadttempel (en: City-Temple or City-Synagogue) is the main synagogue of Vienna, Austria. It is located in the 1st District (Innere Stadt), at Seitenstettengasse 4.

The synagogue was constructed from 1825 to 1826 by the Viennese architect Joseph Kornhäusel in a neo-classicistic style. The luxurious ''Stadttempel'' was fitted into the block of houses and hidden from plain view from the street. This went back to an edict issued by Emperor Joseph II that only Catholic places of worship were allowed to have a direct means of entry from the street. This situation actually saved the synagogue from total destruction during the ''Reichskristallnacht'' in November 1938, as the Nazis were afraid that the whole block could go up in flames. The other 93 synagogues and Jewish prayer-houses of Vienna were badly damaged or destroyed. In August 1981 two people died after Arab terrorists threw a hand grenade at the synagogue. Today the synagogue is the main temple for the Viennese Jewish Community of about 7,000 members.
