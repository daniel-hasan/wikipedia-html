The Banana massacre, in Spanish, ''Matanza de las bananeras''; ; or ''Masacre de las bananeras'' was a massacre of workers for the United Fruit Company that occurred on December 6, 1928 in the town of Ciénaga, Magdalena|Ciénaga near Santa Marta, Colombia. An unknown number of workers died;See Talk:Santa Marta Massacre#The Death Toll; after the government decided to send the military forces to end a month long strike organized by the workers' union in order to demand better working conditions.

Strike
The workers of the banana plantations in Colombia went on strike in December 1928. They demanded written contracts, eight-hour days, six-day weeks and the elimination of food coupons.The strike turned into the largest labor movement ever witnessed in the country until then. Radical members of the Liberal Party, as well as members of the Socialist and Communist Parties, participated.;;

Massacre
An army regiment from Bogotá was dispatched by the government to deal with the strikers, which it deemed to be subversive. Whether these troops were sent in at the behest of the United Fruit company was and remained a matter of debate.

The troops set up their machine guns on the roofs of the low buildings at the corners of the main square, closed off the access streets,; p. 16;
and after a five minute warning; opened fire into a dense Sunday crowd of workers and their wives and children who had gathered, after Sunday Mass,; p. 16; to wait for an anticipated address from the governor.; p. 132;

Number dead
General Cortés Vargas, who commanded the troops during the massacre, took responsibility for 47 casualties, but the exact number of casualties has never been confirmed. Herrera Soto, co-author of a comprehensive and detailed study of the 1928 strike, has put together various estimates given by contemporaries and historians, ranging from 47 to 2,000.;

Among the survivors was Luis Vicente Gámez, later a famous local figure, who survived by hiding under a bridge for three days. Every year after the massacre he delivered a memorial service over the radio.

Justifications
General Cortés Vargas, who issued the order to shoot, argued later that he had issued the order because he had information that U.S. boats were poised to land troops on Colombian coasts to defend American personnel and the interests of the United Fruit Company. Vargas issued the order so the US would not invade Colombia. This position was strongly criticized in the Senate, especially byJorge Eliécer Gaitán, who argued that those same bullets should have been used to stop the foreign invader.[http://64.233.179.104/translate_c?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masacre_de_las_Bananeras&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DMasacre%2Bde%2Blas%2BBananeras%2Bwikipedia%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26hs%3DPrQ%26lr%3D%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DG]

Consequences

Guerrilla movements in Colombia like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia argued that one of the consequences for the development of communism in Colombia was triggered by events like these and called it state terrorism. The Banana massacre is set to be one of the main events that preceded the Bogotazo, the subsequent era of violence known as La Violencia and the guerrillas that developed during the bipartisan National Front to created the ongoing Colombian armed conflict.
