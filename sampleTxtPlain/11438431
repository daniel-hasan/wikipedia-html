History
There is evidence that the Fox River valley near Silver Springs was populated by indigenous people near the end of the last Ice Age, 10&amp;ndash;14,000 years ago.; The originaltract of land that became Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area was purchased by the state of Illinois in 1969, and has been open since January of that year.;; The park is located in Kendall County, Illinois, five miles west of the city of Yorkville.

Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area was one of five new state parks opened in northern Illinois from 1969&amp;ndash;1971. As part of more thanadded to the Illinois state park system during this period, Silver Springs opened to alleviate traffic at other state parks in the area. At the time, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), which oversees the state park system, was attempting to provide the Chicago area with the most state park facilities in Illinois.;Bukro, Casey. &quot;New State Park openings&quot;, ([http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=597244632&amp;sid=2&amp;Fmt=2&amp;clientId=8829&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP ProQuest]), ''Chicago Tribune'', 27 June 1971.

The park had nine extant wells tapping the Galena&amp;ndash;Platteville Aquifer when the state purchased the property. By 1973 a modern well was drilled, reaching a depth of 120 feet (36.6 m). The well, located near the park entrance, was drilled by K &amp; K Well Drilling Co. of Mokena, Illinois through black dirt, gravel, clay, and limestone. Upon completion, the well produced about 500 gallons (1,892 l) per day during the summer. The well provides the park with water, but the other nine wells remained in use following its completion.;Woller, Dorothy M. and Gibb, James P. &quot;[http://www.sws.uiuc.edu/pubdoc/B/ISWSB-60-04.pdf Public Groundwater Supplies in Kendall County],&quot; (PDF), ''Illinois Department of Registration and Education'', 1974, p. 15.

A prairie restoration project began onwithin Silver Springs in 1980;was added to the restoration project in 1991.;&quot;[http://dnr.state.il.us/Lands/Landmgt/PARKS/R2/SILVERSP.HTM Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area],&quot; ''Illinois Department of Natural Resources'', official site. Retrieved 12 October 2007.; The IDNR undertook another prairie restoration in an area within the park, on the north side of the Fox River, in 2002. For the 2002 project, the IDNR removed numerous invasive species from the area including: basswood, ash, maple, and exotic honeysuckle. The non-native exotic honeysuckle species had thrived in the absence of fire through human intervention. These actions were meant to allow native burr and black oak, and shagbark hickory a chance to reproduce.;
