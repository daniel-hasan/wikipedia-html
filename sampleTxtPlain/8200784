''Beyond Fantasy Fiction'' was a US fantasy fiction magazine edited by H. L. Gold, of which only ten issues were published, from 1953 to 1955.Although not a commercial success, it included several significant short stories by distinguished authors, such as Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury and Philip K. Dick.;Asimov's &quot;Kid Stuff&quot; and Dick's &quot;The King of the Elves&quot; appeared in the September 1953 issue: Bradbury's &quot;The Watchful Poker Chip&quot; appeared in the March 1954 issue: .These and more may be found via an online index: ;The publication has been described by critics as a successor to the tradition of ''Unknown'', a fantasy magazine that folded in 1943 and was noted for printing fantasy with a rational basis, such as stories about werewolves with a scientific explanation. A selection of stories from ''Beyond'' was published in paperback form in 1963, also under the title ''Beyond''.

James Gunn, a historian of science fiction, regarded the magazine as the best of the fantasy magazines launched in the early 1950s, and science fiction encyclopediast Donald H. Tuck felt it printed very good material.Not every critic felt ''Beyond'' was completely successful, however; P. Schuyler Miller, in a 1963 review, commented that the stories were most successful when they did not try to emulate ''Unknown''.

History and significance
''Beyond Fantasy Fiction'' was a fantasy-oriented companion to the more successful ''Galaxy Science Fiction'', which launched in 1950; ''Beyond'' had been planned by editor H.&amp;nbsp;L. Gold from the time ''Galaxy'' was launched, but had to wait until ''Galaxy'' was firmly established.;Michael ; Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&amp;nbsp;65–66.;''Beyonds first issue, dated July 1953, included an editorial by Gold in which he laid out the magazine's scope, excluding (in his words) only &quot;the probably possible&quot; and &quot;the unentertaining&quot;.;H.L. Gold, &quot;Beyond&quot;, in ''Beyond Fantasy Fiction'', July 1953, p.&amp;nbsp;2.; Gold recruited Sam Merwin, who had recently quit as editor of ''Fantastic Universe,'' to help in editing, though Gold was listed as editor on the masthead of both magazines.;A typical issue of ''Beyond'' included a couple of stories that were long enough to be listed as novellas or novelettes, with the contents filled out with shorter works, usually for a total of at least seven stories.;See the individual issues, and also the index at ; 

The first issue featured Theodore Sturgeon, Damon Knight and Richard Matheson.Other writers who appeared in the magazine included Jerome Bixby, John Wyndham, James E. Gunn, Fredric Brown, Frederik Pohl (both under his own name and with Lester del Rey under the joint pseudonym &quot;Charles Satterfield&quot;), Philip José Farmer, Randall Garrett, Zenna Henderson, and Algis Budrys.;

Isaac Asimov's signature at the end of his story &quot;Kid Stuff&quot; in the September 1953 issueFive of the ten covers were surrealist, which was an unusual artistic choice for a genre magazine.The cover painting for the first issue was by Richard M. Powers; Gold was one of the very few American magazine editors to use his work, though Powers was prolific in the paperbacks.; The Nicholls ''Encyclopedia of SF'' states that Powers' Surrealist style was &quot;unique in sf&quot; and notes that he did few magazine covers, working mainly for book publishers. Jon Gustafson and Peter Nicholls, &quot;Powers, Richard M.&quot;, in Peter Nicholls and John Clute, eds, ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993; ISBN 0312096186), p.952.;In addition to Powers, René Vidmer and Arthur Krusz (among others) contributed cover art.The magazine carried interior artwork, usually multiple illustrations, for almost every story; and in addition, each story included a facsimile of the author's signature, set at the end of the text.The best-known interior artist ''Beyond'' used was Ed Emshwiller, though there were several other regulars.The magazine carried almost no non-fiction, though there were occasional &quot;filler&quot; pieces to fill spaces at the end of stories.;For example, the January 1954 issue has a half-page filler entitled &quot;Feline Facts&quot;, about the habits of cats.;There were no book reviews, and only the first issue carried an editorial.;

The magazine was not commercially successful: at that time circulation figures were not required to be published annually, as they were later,;See for example the statement of circulation in &quot;Statement Required by the Act of October 23, 1962&quot;, ''Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact'' vol.&amp;nbsp;76, no&amp;nbsp;4 (December 1965), p.161.; so the actual circulation figures are not known. It lasted less than two years, its demise caused in part by the decreasing popularity of fantasy and horror fiction.;

Reception
March 1954 issue of ''Beyond Fantasy Fiction''.Cover art by Scott Templar. According to science-fiction historian Donald H. Tuck ''Beyond'' published &quot;some very good material,&quot;;Donald H. Tuck writes &quot;Although it printed some very good material, it was never commercially successful.&quot; &quot;''Beyond Fantasy Fiction''&quot;, in Donald H. Tuck, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy'' (Chicago: Advent, 1982; ISBN 0-911682-26-0), Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, p.549.; with appearances by many well-known authors, and the magazine is often cited as being the successor to the unusual fantasy tradition of ''Unknown''.;Malcolm Edwards describes it as &quot;conceived in the same spirit as ''Unknown''&quot;. Edwards, &quot;Beyond Fantasy Fiction&quot;, in Peter Nicholls and John Clute, eds, ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction: An Illustrated A to Z'' (London: Granada, 1981; ISBN 0586053808), p.70. Mike Ashley comments that ''Beyond'' &quot;is generally acknowledged as the natural successor to ''Unknown''&quot;. Ashley, &quot;''Beyond Fantasy Fiction''&quot;, p.110.;Author James Gunn said of the new fantasy magazines that appeared in the 1950s that &quot;the best of these was ''Beyond'', created by Horace Gold as a companion fantasy magazine to ''Galaxy'', which he had created three years before. ''Beyond Fantasy Fiction'' aimed at the same rationalized fantasy niche that ''Unknown'' had established and to which Gold had contributed stories.&quot;;Excerpted from 2003 edition at ;Not everyone thought the magazine was completely successful in emulating ''Unknown'', however; P. Schuyler Miller|P.&amp;nbsp;Schuyler Miller, reviewing an anthology drawn from the pages of ''Beyond'', was generally approving but commented that &quot;Except for Budrys, Pohl, Brown and Sturgeon, these stories from ''Beyond'' are rather self-conscious.They are best when they are not trying to be like ''Unknown''.&quot;Miller's assessment of the magazine overall was that it &quot;made a pass at the same position [as ''Unknown''] but didn't make it.&quot;;&quot;The Reference Library&quot;, ''Analog Science Fact&amp;mdash;Science Fiction'' vol.&amp;nbsp;71, no&amp;nbsp;5 (July 1963), pp.&amp;nbsp;87&amp;ndash;88.;

''Beyonds selection of stories has been described by a historian of sf Michael Ashley as &quot;seeking to achieve &amp;hellip; high quality fantasy fiction acceptable to all readers&quot;; he adds that ''Beyond'' was more successful than ''Fantastic Science Fiction'', a competitor in this niche, because Gold &quot;had a clearer vision and was more determined &amp;hellip; to achieve it. &amp;hellip; despite sales problems, Gold persisted in publishing fiction that sought to stretch the boundaries of imagination.&quot;;

Several significant or widely reprinted stories appeared during ''Beyonds short history:;All but the Gunn and Dick stories are included by Tuck in his list of &quot;Notable fiction&quot; from ''Beyond''. The Gunn story is mentioned as a classic by Ashley, in &quot;''Beyond Fantasy Fiction''&quot;, p.110. Dick's story is included because of his current prominence; see Tuck &quot;''Beyond Fantasy Fiction''&quot;.;

Although no Hugo Awards were presented in 1954, the 2004 World Science Fiction Convention awarded &quot;Hugo Award#Retro Hugos|Retro Hugos&quot; for that year.Two ''Beyond'' stories appeared as runners-up: Sturgeon's &quot;&amp;hellip;And My Fear Is Great&amp;hellip;&quot; placed third in the novella category, and Cogswell's &quot;The Wall Around the World&quot; fifth in the novelette category.In addition, Gold placed fifth in the editor category, though this recognized his work at ''Galaxy'' as well as at ''Beyond''.;;

Bibliographic details
The publisher was Galaxy Publishing Corporation, New York.The magazine was initially titled ''Beyond Fantasy Fiction'', and this remained the title on the masthead throughout the ten-issue run.However, issue 9 changed the title to simply ''Beyond Fiction'' on the cover, spine, and table of contents.Issue 10 used the new, shorter title on the cover and spine, but reverted to ''Beyond Fantasy Fiction'' for the table of contents.;Not described in the reference works; see the individual issues.;As a result the magazine is often listed as having changed its name for the last two issues.;See the individual issues, and also the index atTuck, &quot;''Beyond Fantasy Fiction''&quot;, p.549.;

The magazine began as a 160-page digest, priced at 35 cents.The price stayed the same throughout the run, but the page count was cut to 128 for the eighth issue, September 1954.The magazine was bimonthly, but issues 9 and 10 did not carry month and year dates, which has led different bibliographers to catalogue them in different ways.However, the masthead for these issues indicates that the magazine remained bimonthly, and so they are now usually catalogued as November 1954 and January 1955, respectively; the copyright dates on the last two issues correspond to these dates.The volume numbering was completely regular; volume 1 had six numbers, and volume 2 ceased with its fourth number.;The stories were printed in the two-column format usual to digest magazines.;Not described in the reference works; see the individual issues.;

A British edition of the magazine ran for four issues on a bimonthly schedule starting in November 1953 and finishing in May 1954.These copied the first four issues of the US version, with slightly cut contents. They were numbered 1 to 4 but were not dated.;Ashley, ''Beyond Fantasy Fiction,'' p.110; Tuck, &quot;''Beyond Fantasy Fiction''&quot;, p.549.;Ten years after the magazine folded, nine stories from ''Beyond'' were collected into the 160-page paperback ''Beyond'', published in 1963 by Berkley Books (F712) and edited by Thomas Dardis (who was not credited on the book).;Mike ; Ashley, ''Beyond Fantasy Fiction,'' in John Clute and John Grant, eds, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'' (New York: St. Martin's; ISBN 0312145942), 110.;
