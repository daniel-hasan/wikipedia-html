The Vancouver Giants are a junior ice hockey team playing in the Western Hockey League (WHL). The Giants won the national title, the Memorial Cup, in 2007. Their home rink is Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, British Columbia, the WHL's 2nd largest market, to Seattle. 

The ownership group includes Ron Toigo, Hockey Hall of Fame member Gordie Howe and Pat Quinn, former National Hockey League coach and general manager.

History
The team first began play during the 2001-02 WHL season when they compiled 13 wins, 49 losses, and 6 ties. The first goal in franchise history was scored by Tyson Mulock in a loss to the Kamloops Blazers.

In the 2002-03 WHL season the Giants went 26-37-5-4 and made their first playoff appearance, but lost in the first round to the Kelowna Rockets in four games.

In the 2003-04 WHL season the Giants showed even more improvement, this time posting a 33-24-9-6 which was the first time the Giants were above .500. They lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Everett Silvertips after beating Kamloops in five games. 

In the 2004-05 WHL season the Giants went 34-30-4-4 and Gilbert Brule came third in the league in scoring. The Giants lost in the first round to Kelowna. Despite the early exit, the Giants drew many fans to the Coliseum that year thanks to the 2004-05 NHL lockout. Game 6 against the Rockets drew over 16,000 fans.

In the 2005-06 WHL season the Giants went 47-19-0-6, their best record in franchise history. In the first round of the playoffs the Giants beat the Prince George Cougars in five games, then the Portland Winterhawks also in five games. They then won eight straight games beating Everett in the conference finals and Moose Jaw Warriors in the President's Cup. Giants forward Gilbert Brule was named the WHL Playoff MVP after scoring 16 goals and 30 points in 18 post-season games, including notching five goals and 12 points in the four-game series versus Moose Jaw. 

In the 2006 Memorial Cup, the Giants finished tied for third in the round-robin, defeating the Peterborough Petes in the tie-breaker, but losing to the Moncton Wildcats in the semi-final.

The Giants went to seven games in the final series of the 2006-07 WHL season playoffs, losing tothe Medicine Hat Tigers. The Giants won the 2007 Memorial Cup 3-1 on May 27, 2007, against the Medicine Hat Tigers, which they hosted at the Pacific Coliseum.
