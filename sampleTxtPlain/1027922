 is a Japanese manga series created by author Lynn Okamoto. A thirteen-episode anime television series adaptation based on the manga was produced by the studio ARMS, and broadcast on TV Tokyo from July to October 2004; the anime was later licensed in North America on DVD by ADV Films. The anime started before the manga was complete; as a result, the plot differed between the two, especially towards the ending of the story. In 2005, a special original video animation, written to occur between the tenth and eleventh episodes of the series, was released. The title is literally German for &quot;Elfin Song&quot;, and takes its name from the poem ''Elfenlied'' and the German ''lied'', a classical-romantic poem or musical work.

''Elfen Lied'' revolves around the race of diclonius, a mutant human species identified by two cat-ear like horns and transparent &quot;vectors&quot;, and the ways in which the humans abuse and reject them as part of society, instead seizing them for storage and experimentation in an offshore laboratory. The series is centered around the teenage diclonius girl &quot;Lucy&quot;, said to be the first diclonius, becoming sadistic as a result of her vengeance and delivering it on the humans who rejected her.

''Elfen Lied'' involves themes of social alienation, identity, revenge and the value of humanity. ;;The series employs graphic violence and nudity, especially the graphic opening sequence of the first episode. So far, only the thirteen-episode anime series has been licensed in the United States, by ADV Films. ADV Films said the series was one of their bestselling and &quot;most notorious&quot; releases of 2005.;;;;

Story
=Main characters=

Lucy.
 is a teenage diclonius girl around 18 years old. In the anime, she has four vectors with a limited range of two meters, however in the manga, she appears to have many more vectors with greater range.Wihin her two-metre range, she can be swift and lethal, and will use any nearby objects as high velocity projectiles to kill at greater distances. She is also capable of stopping or deflecting most standard ammunition when she concentrates on the task.Lucy has developed strong emotions of hatred and vengeance towards humans mainly because of how she was treated by the humans around her as a child, who made fun of her horns and called her a freak.They said she was &quot;freaky&quot; because she didn't laugh or cry, and so, just to make her cry, they killed her only friend, a stray dog, in front of her. Consequently, she discounts non-diclonii, claiming they are not real people. She seems to lack empathy, kills without much concern, and acts somewhat sadistically, such as tearing off Nana's limbs when she came to retrieve her. Despite this lack of concern for human life she will not harm Kouta.

 is a split personality of Lucy that developed after a .50 BMG round ricocheted off a metallic helmet encasing her head. Nyu has a childlike personality and infantile knowledge of the world, forgetting even that she is a diclonius and how to use or manifest her vectors leaving her a human with horns. She initially lacks spoken language skills; however, she eventually learns a handful of words and phrases. Nyu is innocent and incapable of violent acts, a foil to the normally cold and sadistic Lucy; she is the manifestation of her &quot;good side&quot;. When Nyu is attacked violently (or hit on the head), she regresses into Lucy; likewise, when Lucy is treated with love and kindness, she will uncontrollably switch back into Nyu.



Kouta.
 is around nineteen-years-old and enters the story when his cousin's family allows him to move in to their closed down restaurant in exchange for maintenance while he goes to a local university. Kouta has repressed traumatic memories of his father's and sister's deaths during his childhood at Lucy's hands. Because of him repressing his memories, Kouta does not remember Lucy from when he met her earlier as a child. Due in part to his loss, he has a soft spot for girls in trouble and is extremely generous and protective to the girls around him. He is more forgiving in the anime, but in the manga when he gets his memories back he truly is unforgiving about Lucy killing his father and sister.Yuka.



 is Kouta's cousin.;Elfen Lied Ep. 1: Yuka greets Kouta and then says &quot;''Yuka desu... Itoko no...''&quot;「ユカです…従姉妹の…」, which quite unambiguously translates as &quot;I'm Yuka. Your cousin.&quot;; She is also around 19 years old and planning to attend the same university as Kouta. She moves in with him at the inn after having not seen him in many years. Having had a crush on Kouta since childhood, she is in love with him,;Yuka's relationship with Kouta may be considered taboo or illegally incestuous by U.S. viewers, but relationships between cousins is not considered scandalous in Japan and is a topic seen regularly in anime. See: ''[http://www.animenation.net/news/askjohn.php?id=1373 Why is Romance Between Cousins Common in Anime?]''; and is therefore jealous of Kouta's attention to Nyu, to the point of being very irrational.



=Plot=

The story is based around the diclonius, a species of mutant humans with two cat-ear like horns and &quot;vectors&quot;, telekinetically controlled arms which resonate at a frequency to the point in which they become transparent, and have the power to deflect or destroy anything within their range.All diclonius seem to be girls only. Male diclonius are rare throughout the whole series (first one being the Professor at Kohta's school as seen in the manga), and they refer to themselves using , the genderless form of &quot;I&quot; in Japanese. They also all have pink eyes and hair unlike regular humans who have brown, black, blonde, and red hair. 

At the beginning of the series, diclonii are being held for storage in a facility off the coast of Kamakura in Kanagawa, south of the city of Yokohama, held by the scientist Kurama.The first of the diclonius race, a teenage girl named by the staff as &quot;Lucy&quot;, escapes the factory, stark naked and using her vectors to deflect gunfire and somehow effortlessly kill the security guards and Kurama's clumsy secretary in her path.However, as she makes her way out of the facility, she is shot in the back of the head by an unnamed sniper armed with a .50 caliber rifle, breaking her metal helmet and causing her to fall into the sea.

The next morning, Kouta, a university-age school student, is moving to Kamakura to study in university where he is reunited with his cousin Yuka.While reminiscing about his younger sister on a beach, who is later explained to have died &quot;of an illness&quot;, he encounters the diclonius, still naked and badly wounded in the head from the bullet round.She is somewhat helpless and, as a result of brain damage sustained from the bullet wound, is reduced to the knowledge and capability of an infant, only capable of saying the word &quot;Nyu&quot;.Kouta and Yuka decide to take her with them, naming her &quot;Nyu&quot; as a result.

Kouta, who is moving in to the Kaede House, (which was traditional Japanese restaurant that was inhabited by previous generations) in Kamukura, puts Nyu under his care.Nyu, still helplessly dumbfounded, has no idea of who or where she is, however Kouta and Yuka believe that they can find out where Nyu belongs, and in the meantime, keep her safe.However, after Kouta get angry at Nyu, she runs off back to the beach where she was found.The homeless girl Mayu and her dog encounter Nyu, and Kouta traces Nyu back to the beach, discovering that Kurama has hunted a Special Assault Team to hunt her down.

However, Lucy and her cold character have not faded away yet; when she bumps her head, she reverts to her sadistic side, and makes transitions between her two personalities throughout the series.Yuka, who is in love with Kouta, begins to envy the attention he gives to Nyu, remembering their relationship together as children, however Kouta is still anxious about finding out who Nyu really is.Upon finding out that Mayu is homeless, and that she witnessed the assault team track Nyu, Kouta puts her under his care.

Kouta does not discover the real Lucy and her past inside Nyu, however, Lucy, still with the vengeance of being rejected and abused throughout her life, begins to deliver her revenge on humans, as Kurama and the Special Assault Team continue to hunt her down.

=Diclonius=

Diclonius, according to the anime, are said to be the result of experimentation, and, as Lucy points out to Nana in episode four, the vectors of the diclonius are &quot;experimental equipment&quot;. Their bodies are very similar to humans, however they posess two cat-ear like &quot;horns&quot; on the side of their head, which are said to relate to their telekinetic powers.Their powers involve the usage of invisible arms, known as &quot;vectors&quot;, which the dicolnius can use with great skill and manipulation, such as to dodge bullets and manipulate the movement of objects.Diclonii also have the ability to detect the location of each other, such as when Kurama releases Nana from the offshore laboratory to search for and retrieve Lucy.

=Side stories=
The manga also features several side stories from previous works done by Lynn Okamoto. These stories came included with the release of certain volumes of the manga as bonus material (not related to Elfen Lied) for fans of the manga to collect.
* ''MOL'' - featured in volume one
* ''Digitopolis'' - featured in volume two
* ''Memoria'' - featured in volume three
* ''Carrera'' - featured in volume five

In addition, volume eight includes two other stories that form part of the Elfen Lied universe.

* ''NOZOMI'' is the first side story featured, and explains Nozomi's past and why she chooses to move into the Kaede Inn. This tale is in canon with the continuity of the main storyline.
* The second side story that follows after NOZOMI involves the whole residents at the Kaede Inn throwing a party and indulging themselves in excessive drinking. Nana and Mayu fall asleep, allowing both Yuka and Nyu to release their inhibitions and deliver an intimate fan service to Kohta. Unfortunately, their fun is suddenly brought to an end when Nyu without warning switches back to Lucy who seems rather upset, ending the story with a cliffhanger. This tale is not canon for Elfen Lied's overall plot.

Anime
Well-known promotional poster used both in Japan and internationally to advertise the series.The opening scenes, and promotional material such as the poster above, pay homage to Gustav Kilmt's &quot;The Kiss&quot; artwork.
=Format=
The television series, directed by Mamoru Kanbe, animated by ARMS and produced by GENCO and VAP, ran for 13 episodes and adapted approximately the first 60 out of 107 chapters of the manga. Episodes one to eleven of the anime are in canon with the continuity of the storyline for volumes one to six of the manga, faithfully adapting most of the events happening in the latter. The last two TV episodes strayed from the manga's continuity and gave an original conclusion to the anime. The series' author, Lynn Okamoto, has a brief cameo appearance as a special guest in episode twelve.

Elfen Lied first aired on TV Tokyo's AT-X satellite channel from July 25 2004 to October 17 2004 and was broadcast again in 2005. The anime was licensed by ADV Films in the United States in 2004 and was released on DVD in 2005. A single twenty-four-minute original video animation episode was also released. It takes place between episodes ten and eleven of the original TV series, and for that reason, some refer to it as ''episode 10.5'', ''OVA special'', or even as ''episode fourteen''. The special itself takes on a lighter tone and answers some questions of the early episodes rather than advancing the plot. During the ''Anime Boston 2006'';; (May 26—28) convention, ADV Films acquired the distribution rights of the OVA for release in the United States.

The series is currently airing in the United Kingdom on Propeller TV (Sky Digital) as part of Anime Network's launch in the UK. So far the series has aired uncut with the exception of one of Mayu's flashbacks in episode five as a result of it being related to child rape at the hands of a stepfather. While it has yet to appear on US television other than on Anime Network's &quot;On Demand&quot; Channel, the DVD box set confirms that the series has a rating of TV-MAVS; the Canadian rating is 18A. The OVA episode was not released with the box set that became available in November 2006.

In a posting on the official Adult Swim message board, Adult Swim programming director Kim Manning revealed that Adult Swim inquired into possibly airing the series, as she was an avid fan herself and watched the entire series in one sitting.However, the censorship board revealed that the series would have to be so heavily edited (&quot;it would have been cut to shreds&quot;) in order to air that it would have been unintelligible, and it does not appear that it will air on the channel at any time in the future.;;

=Plot deviations=
Compared to its manga original, the approach and depth of information presented by the anime involving the diclonius race differs greatly. The diclonius virus is explained in less detail with scenes such as Professor Kakuzawa's explanation of the half-diclonius status and ancestry of his family to Lucy being omitted. The diclonius characters in general are shown to have distinct limits on their vectors' quantity and range, which is not true in the manga which states that Lucy's are still growing. 

Characters were introduced in the manga that were otherwise completely omitted from the anime series. An example of this early on in the manga is an acquaintance of Yuka's, referred to as &quot;Nozomi-chan.&quot; Similarly, the music box playing the &quot;Lilium&quot; melody that is featured in the anime never appears in the manga.

=Reception=
The series has received praise for its story and technical excellence in production quality, animation and color.; ;;;;;;;Due to the many scenes of nudity and gore in the series, it has drawn criticism as being &quot;overly blatant&quot;; or &quot;sad and forced&quot;;;.The boldness of the first seven minutes of the first episode have deterred some viewers and caused controversy as to its release.The series has drawn criticism for having sub-par voice acting in the first three episodes in both the Japanese and English dubs.; Another criticism is that the series ends abruptly with some loose ends to the story that could leave viewers unsatisfied.;;

Despite these criticisms, Western reviewers also describe the series as &quot;really a genuinely good watch&quot;,;; &quot;a horror series of exceptional merit&quot;,; &quot;certainly memorable&quot;; and &quot;a very special show, good and bad parts taken into consideration&quot;.;; In the 2004 AnimeReactor Community Awards, fans voted the Elfen Lied anime as the Best Opening/Ending Combination, Best Drama, Best Thriller (Mystery/Horror), Best Fanservice and also voted Lucy/Nyu as Best Female Character.;; Also at the first annual American Anime Awards 2007 at New York Comic-Con, Elfen Lied was nominated for &quot;Best Short Series&quot;.

=Style and themes=
In the comments made by director Mamoru Kanbe on the Elfen Lied website, he intended for the anime to question and discuss values based on the way in which humans divide each other by difference, as well as the belief that atrocities such as those committed by Lucy in the series are strongly influenced by the way in which people are treated by their fellow beings.The series frequently discusses the events and treatment which define the human character in such a way, and the problems which arise from discrimination, as well as the wild contrasts between compassion and vengeance between fellow humans, through the strong vengeance of Lucy compared with her past memory of Kouta.Many of the themes are mentioned at the teasers at the ends of episodes in the series.

The first seven minutes of the first episode are known to be some of the most provocative of anime, containing nudity and strong graphic violence.Themes such as genocide and the attempts to &quot;purify&quot; the earth from each other also appear in the anime between diclonii and humans.Both species feel the need to populate the earth with their own species and wipe each other out.Kanbe quoted this in relation to the desire of humans to cast each other out and segregate each other.;;

Throughout the series, there is a great deal of nudity, blood and gore, extreme graphic violence as well as psychological violence. One of the most prevalent motifs of the series is the humanity of the diclonius, especially contrasted against the inhumanity of ordinary people. One reviewer described the series as &quot;devoted to quite a few of the darker, more callous factors of human nature&quot;.; Throughout the series there are various incidences of human sadism, casual beatings, cruel experimentation, and outright killing.

Unlike other anime which distinctively fall into a specific subcategory, ''Elfen Lied'' does not fall under any specific genre, containing elements of horror, comedy, drama, romance, action, science-fiction, and suspense. A majority of the episodes contain graphic amounts of violence and gruesome deaths. There is also a lot of female nudity and serious thematic material such as child rape and torture. The series also sometimes has strong language; the word &quot;fuck&quot; is used several times throughout in the English localization. Compared to the other anime of its time, the series is very radical, bold and daring in terms of its plot and content.The series juxtaposes many different tones and genres and was described by a reviewer as &quot;mixing insane amounts of violence with a heavy dose of &quot;ultra-cuteness.&quot;;; The series balances its darker themes with romantic sub-plots as well as many comic moments. Elfen Lied has been described as similar to, or borrowing elements from ''Chobits'', ''3x3 Eyes''; and ''Gunslinger Girl''.;

=Theme songs=
*Opening theme: &quot;Lilium&quot; 
&quot;Lilium&quot; is written to sound like a Gregorian chant.During the production of the series, Kanbe himself requested that the theme song for the series contain references to Christianity and the Bible.Several extracts from Psalms are written into the lyrics, and, to add essence, the song was written entirely in Latin. The recording was performed by the opera singer Kumiko Noma.Four versions of the song were recorded for use in the series: the original, a version performed by several tenors used as background music in some scenes, and one which plays in Kohta's music box.The final version, the &quot;saint version&quot;, with added lyrics, is played in the final conversation between Lucy and Kohta in the last episode.
*Ending theme: &quot;Be Your Girl&quot;
While being a stark contrast to the horror and drama of the series, &quot;Be Your Girl&quot;, performed by Chieko Kawabe, was written in a pop-rock style, and is often regarded by fans as a reflection of the relationship between Nyu and Kohta, however none of the production team have commented of this usage.

=Cultural references=
The opening and ending sequences feature artistic drawings of the principal characters. These characters are drawn in a style based on Gustav Klimt's paintings, imitating poses, colors, and patterns.; The German song ''Elfenlied'' (&quot;Elf Song&quot;) appears in the manga;; and is credited to the composer Hugo Wolf. A poem by Eduard Mörike is the basis for Wolf's version. The song does not appear in the anime as it is taught to Nyu by the manga-only character List of Elfen Lied characters#Minor characters|Nozomi.
