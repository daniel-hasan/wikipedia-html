WLRN-FM is the main public radio station on 91.3 in Miami, Florida, and neighboring Fort Lauderdale.Owned and operated by the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, it is the area's main NPR member station, and has Miami as its city of license.

Its HD2 service is WLRN Xtra HD, &quot;South Floridaâ€™s Alternative News and Talk Station&quot;, featuring talk programming by day and BBC World Service at night. Until December 2, 2007, HD2 carried &quot;Classical 24&quot;, which offered classical music 24 hours per day.;[https://store.friendsofwlrn.org/alleg/images/e-newsletter%20images/digitalradiofaq.htm]; Classical 24 has since moved to another public radio station, WKCP 89.7 FM, after that station's acquisition by Classical 24's parent, American Public Media.

The station also maintains its long-time radio reading service for the blind on an analog subcarrier.

The school board also owns WLRN-TV, a PBS member television station.
