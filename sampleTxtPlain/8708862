A historic district in the United States is a group of buildings, properties or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within a historic district are normally divided into two categories, contributing and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size, some having hundreds of structures while others have just a few.

The U.S. federal government designates historic districts through the U.S. Department of Interior, under the auspices of the National Park Service. Federally designated historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. State Historic Districts can either follow similar criteria and have no restrictions on property owners or they can require strict adherence to historic rehabilitation standards. The local historic district offers, by far, the most legal protection for historic properties because most land use decisions are made at the local level. Local districts are generally administered by the county or municipal government. The tendency of local districts to place restrictions on property owners causes them to be the targets of the most resistance from the public.

The first historic district was located in Charleston, South Carolina and predated the first U.S. federal government designated district by more than thirty years. Other local historic districts popped up and in 1966 the U.S. government created the National Register of Historic Places on the heels of a report from the U.S. Conference of Mayors which stated Americans suffered from &quot;rootlessness.&quot;;By the 1980s there were thousands of federally designated historic districts.

In addition to the two types of classification within historic districts, properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are classified into five broad categories. They are, building, structure, site, district and object; each one has a specific definition in relation to the National Register. All but the eponymous district category are also applied to historic districts listed on the National Register.;

A listing on the National Register of Historic Places is governmental acknowledgment of a historic district. However, the Register is &quot;an honorary status with some federal financial incentives.&quot;;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/workingonthepast/strengths.htm Strengths of Local Listing], Working on the Past in Local Historic Districts, National Park Service.

A district may also comprise individual elements separated geographically but linked by association or history.&quot;;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/regulations.htm#603 Title 36: Section 60.3], Parks Forests and Public Property, Chapter One, Part 60.

Districts established under U.S. federal guidelines generally begin the process of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation.;&quot;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/about.htm About the Register],&quot; National Register of Historic Places, ''National Park Service''. Retrieved 4 April 2007.; While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the U.S. government|federal government.

Retrieved 19 February 2007.; For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.;

In general, the criteria for acceptance to the National Register are applied consistently, but there are considerations for exceptions to the criteria and historic districts have influence on some of those exceptions. Usually, the National Register does not list religious structures, moved structures, reconstructed structures, or properties that have achieved significance within the last 50 years. However, if a property falls into one of those categories and are &quot;integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria&quot; then an exception allowing their listing will be made.; Historic district listings, like all National Register nominations, can be rejected on the basis of owner disapproval. In the case of historic districts, a majority of owners must object in order to nullify a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. If such an objection occurred, then the nomination would become a determination of National Register eligibility only.;

Most U.S. state governments have a listing similar to the National Register of Historic Places. State listings can have similar benefits to federal designation, such as granting qualification and tax incentives. In addition, the property can become protected under specific state laws.; The laws can be similar or different from the federal guidelines that govern the National Register. A state listing of a historic district on a &quot;State Register of Historic Places,&quot; usually by the State Historic Preservation Office, can be an &quot;honorary status,&quot; much like the National Register. For example, in Nevada, listing in the State Register places no limits on property owners.;Whaley, Sean. &quot;[http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Dec-24-Sat-2005/news/5009876.html State adds Goldfield to historic places registry],&quot; ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'', 24 December 2005.

According to the National Park Service, historic districts are one of the oldest forms of protection for historic properties. The city of Charleston, South Carolina is credited with beginning the modern day historic districts movement.; In 1931 Charleston enacted an ordinance which designated an &quot;Old and Historic District&quot; which was administered by a Board of Architectural Review.; Charleston's early ordinance reflected the strong protection that local historic districts often enjoy under local law.

The original concept of an American historic district was as a protective area surrounding more important, individual historic sites. As the field of historic preservation progressed, those involved came to realize that the structures acting as &quot;buffer zones&quot; were actually key elements of the historic integrity of larger, landmark sites. Preservationists came to the view that districts should be more encompassing, blending together a mesh of structures, streets, open space and landscaping to define the historical character of a historic district.;Bigolin, Steve.

As early as 1981 the National Trust for Historic Preservation identified 882 American cities and towns that had some form of &quot;historic district zoning&quot; in place; local laws meant specifically to protect historic districts. Before 1966, historic preservation in the United States was in its infancy. That year the U.S. Conference of Mayors penned an influential report which concluded, in part, that Americans suffered from a sense of &quot;rootlessness.&quot;; They recommended historic preservation to help provide Americans with a sense of orientation. The creation of the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, on the heels of the report, helped to instill that sense of orientation the mayors were looking for.; The mayors also recommended that any historic preservation program not focus solely on individual properties but also on &quot;areas and districts which contain special meaning for the community.&quot; Local, state and federal historic districts now account for thousands of historic property listings at all levels of government.;Datel, Robin Elisabeth. &quot;Preservation and a Sense of Orientation for American Cities,&quot; ''Geographical Review'', Vol. 75, No. 2.
