''Kim Possible'' is an Emmy Award-winning American animated television series about a teenage crime fighter who has the task of dealing with worldwide, family, and school issues every day.The show is action-oriented, but also has a light-hearted atmosphere and often lampoons the conventions and clichés of the secret-agent and action genres. 

Production
Creators Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley claim they created the show in an elevator.As they tell it, McCorkle looked at Schooley and said, &quot;Kim Possible: she can do anything&quot;.Schooley at once replied, &quot;Her partner is Ron Stoppable: he can't do anything&quot;.The creators also maintain that it was always their intention for Kim and Ron to eventually become involved romantically, rather than just remaining best friends.This becomes a reality in the supposed series-ending movie, ''Kim Possible: So the Drama''.The romantic theme also continues in season four. 

The series premiered on Disney Channel in June 2002, and the first episode to air, ''Crush'', was nominated for a Primetime Emmy award the following year.After the premiere of this episode, ''Kim Possible'' was the most watched and highest rated television show on Disney Channel at that time. The series as a whole was nominated for the Daytime Emmyin 2004, and again in 2005 (that year it received 5 nominations and 1 win).;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278866/awards Awards for &quot;Kim Possible&quot;] (2006), retrieved August 4, 2006;.The show has been widely praised for its smart dialogue, fluid animation, and engaging, well-written characters (both heroic and villainous).

On February 22, 2005, after 3 seasons and 65 episodes, the show ended production. Due to the popularity of the series and grassroots operations by dedicated ''KP'' fans, Disney announced on November 29, 2005, that the show would be renewed for a fourth season, which debuted on Disney Channel on February 10, 2007. The series finally ended permanently on September 7, 2007 with the airing of the one-hour-long concluding episode, &quot;Graduation&quot; (see below).

The show's title music, &quot;Call Me, Beep Me&quot;, is sung by Christina Milian.Artist Shane Glines produced the original designs for KP.;[http://www.shaneglines.net/contact/contact.html List of character designs], retrieved December 9, 2007;

''Kim Possible'' also airs on Toon Disney and Family Channel in Canada. Some early episodes have been aired on ABC as part of it's Saturday morning block ABC Kids. A Mandarin version aired on CCTV-12 in China, and an Arabic dub was also made which started airing on Dubai TV in early 2006 and is currently airing on MBC 3 on the network's &quot;Disney morning timeslot&quot;, the only thing that was changed were the character's names, for example Kim was called &quot;''Damo Staheel''&quot; (Mostaheel is Arabic for Impossible), Ron was called &quot;''Mostah Aed''&quot;, Wade was called &quot;''Awad''&quot;, Shego was called &quot;''Shahira''&quot;, and Dr. Drakken was called &quot;''Daraken''&quot;. The show aired on the French Disney Channel and then on TF1's Disney show in France. Several changes were made in the names to fit with translated jokes: for example Ron Stoppable is called Robin Trépide (&quot;Intrépide&quot; meaning some kind of a courageous adventurer).
