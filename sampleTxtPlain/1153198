=Stadium=


Nacional plays most local games at its own legendary stadium, the 20.000 capacity Parque Central, built in 1900. However, in the past decades that stadium was not used very often, since Nacional played at the national stadium “Estadio Centenario”, sharing it with Peñarol that have no stadium. Big matches and derbies are still played at the Centenario. In 2005, the remodeling of Parque Central allowed Nacional to play home matches there again and now is about 30.000 of capacity.

Nacional's stadium, Parque Central, is famous for two reasons.

One of them is that the first match ever played in the history of the FIFA World Cup was held in the Parque Central in 1930.

The other reason is that in the place where the Parque Central is located,was named &quot;Quinta de la Paraguaya&quot; a historic place in Uruguay.

=Nicknames=
Nacional is nicknamed “tricolores” (“three colors”), and “bolsilludos”, later shortened to “bolsos” (“bolsillo” being the Spanish word for pocket - Nacional used to play with a jersey that had a pocket on the chest). “La blanca” (The white) is less common.

Nacional main achievements
=Contribution to Uruguay national team=

In 1903, Uruguay, fully represented by Nacional's team members (due to the refusal of CURCC -another important club of the early 1900's- to cede their players) beat Argentina 3-2, winning the first international match ever in the history of Uruguayan football.

In 1924, Nacional was the club that contributed more players to the Uruguayan team that won the Olympic gold medal in football of that year.

The same thing happened with the Uruguayan teams of 1928 and 1930, Olympic and world champions respectively, in which Nacional contributed the majority of players.

As a matter of fact, Nacional is the only Uruguayan club that contributed players to every Uruguayan national team that won international tournaments.;http://www.nacionaldigital.com/historia/Hechos/nacionalylaselecion.htm;

Miscelaneous
=The first &quot;hincha&quot; was a Nacional fan=

The Spanish word to describe football fans is &quot;hincha&quot;. 

This worldwide used expression was invented by Nacional fans. 

In fact, an employee of Nacional of the early 1900's, called Reyes, was famous for his continuous support to the team. The other fans that attended the games started to name him after one of his duties: pumping air to the balls (in Spanish: &quot;inflar&quot; the balls, in Uruguay: &quot;hinchar&quot; the balls). Within a few games, Reyes was known as the &quot;hincha&quot; of Nacional. This is the origin of a word that is widely used between Spanish speakers throughout the planet.
