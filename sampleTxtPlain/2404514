Proactiv Solution is a consumer product marketed as a three-step acne treatment system since 1995.It was developed by dermatologists Dr. Katie Rodan and Dr. Kathy Fields.

Product Description
The Proactiv system comprises three different core products, a cleanser, toner and lotion.

Indications and Side Effects
According to the company's website, Proactiv Solution was created to treat mild to moderate cases of acne, not severe cases. Like most antibacterials for treating acne, Proactiv Solution uses Benzoyl peroxide as one of the main active ingredients.Benzoyl peroxide may cause dryness and peeling of the skin.Certain side effects may include: allergic reactions such as redness, itching, hives, swelling and a burning sensation after topical application.Benzoyl peroxide may also cause increased sensitivity to sunlight and induce collar-specific bleaching in clothes. As an alternative product, Proactiv Solution has marketed the ''Gentle Formula'' kit, containing Salicylic acid instead of Benzoyl Peroxide.It is unclear if these same side effects exist with the Salicylic acid preparation.

Sales and marketing strategies
In North America, Proactiv Solutions is sold mainly through infomercials, as advertised by Guthy-Renker, at mall kiosks, and online.Buyers may be automatically entered into a subscription business model, upsetting some consumers. ; [http://ripoffreport.com/searchresults.asp?q1=ALL&amp;q4=&amp;q6=&amp;q3=&amp;q2=&amp;q7=&amp;searchtype=0&amp;submit2=Search%21&amp;q5=proactiv ProActiv Complaints at Ripoffreport.com];;[http://search.complaints.com/search?btnG=Search%2BComplaints.com&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;sort=date%253AD%253AL%253Ad1&amp;client=complaints&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;proxystylesheet=complaints&amp;site=complaints&amp;q=proactiv ProActiv Complaints at Complaints.com];

Celebrity Spokespeople
Guthy-Renker's marketing campaigns make heavy use of celebrity spokespeople. Celebrities are featured heavily in Proactiv informercials, recounting their &quot;true-life&quot; stories of using the product. However, it has not been established whether the named celebrities have actually used or currently use ProActiv Solution.According to one source, Associated Content, before Jessica Simpson signed her endorsement deal with ProActiv, she stated publicly that she cured her acne through a prescribed medication called Accutane, an extremely powerful internal medication that stops the production of excess oil which causes acne.;http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/122954/the_jessica_simpson_acne_lie.html;Nonetheless, the following celebrities, including Jessica Simpson herself, have endorsed ProActiv Solution:
