Coral Springs, officially chartered July 10, 1963, is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States, approximatelynorthwest of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. According to the U.S. Census Bureau estimates of 2006, the city had a population of 129,805.;; It is part of the South Florida metropolitan area, which is home to 5,463,857&amp;nbsp;people.;; 

The city was master-planned and primarily developed by WCI Communities, then known as Coral Ridge Properties. The city's name is derived from the company's name, and was selected after several earlier proposals had been considered and rejected.;; Despite the name, there are no springs in the city; Florida's springs are found in the central and northern portions of the state.;;

During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the young city grew rapidly, adding over 35,000&amp;nbsp;residents each decade. Coral Springs has a distinctive atmosphere among South Florida cities, due in part to its stringent codes designed to maintain the city's aesthetic appeal. The city government's effective fiscal management has maintained high bond ratings, and the city has won accolades for its overall livability, its low crime rate, and its family-friendly orientation.

History
Coral Springs is a planned community. Prior to its incorporation as a city in July 1963, the area which is now Coral Springs was part of 20,000&amp;nbsp;acres (80 km²) of marshy lands bought by Henry Lyons between 1911 and 1939. After several floods in 1947, Florida created the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District (now the South Florida Water Management District). Canals and levees drained much of the area upon which Coral Springs was built. After the land was drained and cleared, most of the area was used as a bean farm. After Lyons death in 1952 his heirs changed the focus to cattle.;;

A post-World War II real estate boom in South Florida attracted the interest of developers. Coral Ridge Properties, which already had several developments in Broward County, boughtof land from the Lyons family on December 14, 1961 for $1 million.; The City of Coral Springs was chartered on July 10, 1963. Other names that were considered for the new city included &quot;Curran Village&quot;, &quot;Pompano Springs&quot; and &quot;Quartermore&quot;. By 1964, the company had developed a master plan for a city of 50,000 residents. On July 22, 1964 the first sale of 536 building lots netted $1.6 million. The landmark covered bridge was built that same year to promote the town. In 1965, Coral Ridge Properties bought an additional 6,000&amp;nbsp;acres (24 km²) from the Lyons family; the total land area of Coral Springs increased to . The first city government elections were held in 1967.

The city added nineteen public schools, a regional mall, shopping centers and parks during the last three decades of the twentieth century in response to rapid population growth. The construction of the Sawgrass Expressway in 1986 brought even more growth. A museum and a theater opened in the 1990s. The city reached residential build-out in 2003;; and is very close to a commercial build-out.;;

The city's historically low crime rate was marred in the early 1990s, when teen gang violence made headlines, with fights and murders reported. The violence subsided and the city returned to its previously peaceful state in 1995.;;
