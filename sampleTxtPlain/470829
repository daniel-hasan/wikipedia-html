Tunbridge Wells is a Non-metropolitan district|local government district and borough in Kent, England. It takes its name from its main town, Royal Tunbridge Wells.

The district was formed on April 1, 1974, by the merger of the municipal borough of Royal Tunbridge Wells along with Southborough urban district, Cranbrook Rural District and most of Tonbridge Rural District.

Description of borough
=Location=
The borough of Tunbridge Wells lies along the south eastern border of Kent, partly on the northern edge of the Weald, the remainder on the Weald Clay plain in the upper reaches of the rivers Teise and Beult.

=The North Weald area=
The restricted area immediately to the north and west of Tunbridge Wells lies within the Weald. The presence of sandstone outcrops here, and the chalybeate springs, together with old workings, point to ancient iron manufacturing.

=Weald Clay plain=
This plain is part of the so-called ''Garden of England'', named for its extensive orchards and former hop farms, sheep and cattle. A string of villages lies across this plain, from Brenchley and Horsmonden to Benenden and Headcorn.

=Communications=
* ''Roads'' The main roads through the borough are the A21 London to Hastings road and in the east, the A229, which runs from the A21 at Hurst Green through Cranbrook to Maidstone.
* ''Railways'' The line of the former South Eastern Railway (SER) main line crosses the clay plain in an almost unbroken straight line between Redhill and Ashford, Kent. The SER line to Hastings passes through Tunbridge Wells; here there was once a further branch connection south-eastwards to Groombridge, and at Paddock Wood is the southern terminus of the Medway Valley Line to Maidstone.

Borough organisation
Tunbridge Wells Borough Council is composed of 48 councillors repesenting 20 wards across the borough. Eight wards are within Royal Tunbridge Wells itself including Broadwater, Culverden; Pantiles &amp; St Marks; Park; Rusthall; Sherwood &amp; St John's and St. James. The remainder are rural wards covering the other main towns and villages.

Each of the latter also have their own form of local government in the form of a civil parish. They are as follows, paired where two villages are served by one councillor:
*Benenden &amp; Cranbrook
*Brenchley &amp; Horsmonden
*Capel
*Frittenden, Bidborough&amp; Sissinghurst
*Goudhurst &amp; Lamberhurst
*Hawkhurst &amp; Sandhurst
*Paddock Wood: two wards, East and West
*Pembury
*Southborough: two wards, Southborough &amp; High Brooms; and Southborough North
*Speldhurst &amp; Bidborough

=Politics=

* Conservatives 41 
* Liberal Democrats 7
