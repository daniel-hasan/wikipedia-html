USS ''Illinois'' (BB-65) was to be the fifthconstructed for the United States Navy; she was the fourth ship to be named in honor of the 21st state. Among the s, ''Illinois'' is notable for being one of the two uncompleted battleships, and for being the only member of the class not considered for a rebuild of any kind.

Hull BB-65 was originally to be the first ship of the s, but changes during the Second World War resulted in her being reordered as anmidway through the war. This allowed her to gain eight knots in speed, the ability to transit the locks of the Panama Canal, and to increase the number of anti-aircraft guns. The cost was the loss of her additional armor and a reduction in the heavier armaments that were to have been added to BB-65 during her time on the drawing board as USS ''Montana''. 

Like her sister ship , ''Illinois'' was still under construction at the end of World War II. Her construction was canceled in August 1945, but her hull remained until 1958 when it was broken up. Because ''Illinois'' was only 22% complete at the time she was not considered for any significant rebuild programs, while several proposals were floated to complete her sister ship ''Kentucky'' as a guided missile battleship.

Design

BB-65 began life in mid-1930s as the USS ''Montana'', the lead ship of her class of dreadnought battleships. She would have fielded three more 16-in guns than those mounted aboard the ''Iowa''-class, a more powerful secondary battery of 5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 45 gun|5”/54 caliber DP mounts,;; an increase in armor that was to enable ''Montana'' to withstand the effects of the 16”/50 caliber guns and the 2,700 lb ammunition she and her ''Iowa''-class sisters were to carry. The increase in ''Montana’s'' firepower and armor came at the expense of her speed and her Panamax capabilities, but the latter issue was to be resolved through the construction of a third, much wider set of locks at the Panama Canal,which would have enabled ''Montana'' to transit between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans without the need to move around the tip of South America.;;As USS ''Montana,'' BB-65 would have the only battleship class commissioned by the U.S. to have come close to equaling the Empire of Japan's s on the basis of armor, armament, and tonnage.;;;Minks, R. L. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4442/is_200609/ai_n17193832 &quot;MONTANA CLASS BATTLESHIPS END OF THE LINE&quot;]. Sea Classics. Sep 2006. FindArticles.com. 2007-12-01.;

By 1942 the United States Navy shifted its building focus from battleships to aircraft carriers after the successes of carrier combat in both the Battle of Coral Sea and to a greater extent the Battle of Midway. As a result the construction of the U.S. fleet of s had been given the highest priority for completion in the U.S. shipyards.; The ''Essex''-class carriers were proving vital to the war effort by allowing the Allies to gain and maintain air supremacy in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, and were rapidly becoming the principle striking arm of the United States in the ongoing effort to defeat the Empire of Japan.;Web page: [http://military.discovery.com/convergence/topten/warships/slideshow/slideshow_10.html Top Ten Fighting Ships] Retrieved 23 April 2007.; It was for this reason that the United States accepted certain shortcomings in the armor for their s, ''South Dakota''-class battleships, and s in favor of their additional speed, which enabled these battleship classes to steam at a comparable speed with the ''Essex''-class and provide the carriers with the maximum amount of anti-aircraft protection.;

Development
When BB-65 was redesignated an , she was assigned the name ''Illinois'' and reconfigured to adhere to the &quot;fast battleship&quot; designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the Bureau of Construction and Repair.;;; This was not the first time that changes to the ''Iowa'' class had been proposed: at the time the battleships were cleared for construction some policymakers were not sold on the U.S. need for more battleships, and proposed turning the ''Iowa''-class ships into aircraft carriers by retaining the hull design, but switching their decks to carry and handle aircraft (This had already been done on the battlecruisersand ). The proposal was countered by Admiral Ernest King, the Chief of Naval Operations. ; She would now be the fifth of the six authorized ships of theof battleships.;;;

Like her ''Iowa''-class sisters, ''Illinois'' was to cost $125 million and take roughly 30 to 40 months to complete.;; Her keel was laid down at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 15 January 1945.;; Like ''Kentucky'', ''Illinois'' differed from her earlier sisters in that her design called for an all-welded construction, which would have saved weight and increased strength over a combination riveted/welded hull of the type used on the four completed ''Iowa''-class ships. Engineers considered retaining the original -type armor for added torpedo and naval mine protection (the newer scheme would have improved ''Illinois''’ armor protection by as much as 20%);;; however, this was rejected due to time constraints and because ''Illinois'' was being built along the regular ''Iowa''-class hull design.;;

Scrapping

''Illinois'' construction was canceled and then scrapped after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.;; She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 August 1945,;;; but her incomplete hull (at the time 22% finished) was retained along with her sister ''Kentucky'' until 1958 when both incomplete ships were broken up. She was scrapped in her dry dock on the builder's ways starting in September 1958.;Naval Institute Press. (December 1985). U.S. Battleships: An Illustrated Design History. ISBN 0-87021-715-1.; Although her sister ship USS Kentucky (BB-66)|''Kentucky'' (BB-66) was considered for a rebuild to make her into a guided missile battleship (BBG)&amp;mdash;by removing the aft turret and installing a missile system&amp;mdash;at the time of her cancellation, ''Kentucky'' was 73.1% complete with construction halted at the 1st deck.;;; By contrast, the ''Illinois'' was only 22% complete and thus was not afforded the same option. 

While the ship herself was never completed, the ship's bell was cast, and it currently resides at Memorial Stadium at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; it reads ''USS Illinois 1946''. While the University of Illinois records are unclear as to whether the bell was donated to the University in general or the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) at the University specifically,;;
an Associated Press report seemed to indicate that the bell was donated to NROTC at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Chanpaign in an article published in 1983.;Associated Press. ''&quot;Rose Bell&quot; rings loudly for Illinois''. The Chronicle Telegram, Elyria, Ohio, Sunday, October 30, 1983. Page 31.; According to the AP, the bell previously resided in a Washington muesum untilfinding its new home with the Fighting Illini football team in 1982;; since then, the bell has traditionally been rung by NROTC members in a cumulative manner when the football team scores a touchdown or goal.;
