Tourist trap is a phrase for any establishment or set of establishments that have been created to attract travelers or tourists and provide products for the tourist to purchase.;; While the term may have negative connotations for some, such establishments may be viewed by travelers as fun and interesting diversions, with realistic expectations as to their true importance, or lack thereof.There is some ambiguity in the definition of the phrase as it relates to size, activities, cost of products, and legitimacy. Some operators prefer to call them &quot;family-oriented tourist attractions&quot;.;; 

Goods and activities
Tourist traps provide an opportunity to separate a consumer from their money and are oriented primarily towards non-native or non-local consumers. Because the tourist is on her or his way to a particular attraction, the tourist trap will either offer a distinctly contrary experience or an allied experience.They will offer up &quot;unique&quot; natural or artificial features (the &quot;World's Largest Ball of Twine&quot; or &quot;Silver Springs&quot;) that can only be had at the particular stop, and will then offer up conveniences or activities to entertain and capitalize upon the stopped tourist.

=Goods=
Typically goods available for purchase will include souvenirs and curiosities embossed with the name of the establishment and or local points of interest.Additional products may include the normal range of items found in a Gift shop.

=Activities=
Activities at Tourist traps vary greatly based in part on the surrounding economy and infrastructure. In some areas like Ishpeming, Michigan, Flush toilets may be a sufficient draw to entice tourist to stop. In other locations like Anaheim, California more robust activates are required to draw a tourist to a specific activity over a competitor's activity.Other activities may include, thematic restaurants, arcade games, wax museums, collections of unique artifacts, and so on.

=Mule rides= 
Ralph H. Cameron;; a former resident of Maine, traveled west with his brothers around 1880.Arriving in Flagstaff, Arizona where they took up Sheep#Domestication|sheep herding.Ralph visited the nearby Grand Canyon and realizing its potential as a tourist trap began acquiring properties.Before the Grand Canyon became a National Monument in 1906 the Cameron’s and accomplices had secured over 100 claims including some of the most scenic. They improved an old Indian trail that would become Bright Angel Trail and began charging tourists a dollar toll. For an additional fee you could rent a mule to take you to the bottom of the canyon.At the bottom of the Grand Canyon the trapped tourist would have an opportunity to be sheared again as they were given an opportunity to hire a mule to carry them back to the top!Other opportunities to separate tourists from their dollars included charging for comfort stations.;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/albright2/ Horace M.

In 1928 after a legal battle Coconino Country gained ownership of the profitable toll trail.;;It costs more than a dollar now but you can still rent a mule to take you down the canyon.The web site; ; does not list the cost for the ride down or back up.

Size

Tourist traps range significantly in size, from a single tree;;;; to the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. There may be valid arguments to include traps that are bigger or smaller than these as well.

Stop and Shop

A few establishments take pride in the term and embody it into their names, such as &quot;Da Yoopers Tourist Trap&quot;;; in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, and &quot;The TOURIST TRAP&quot;;; at Deep Creek Lake, Maryland.Other establishments like The &quot;Trees of Mystery&quot;;; in Klamath, California avoid the phrase.If the term is embraced or not, regardless of the price of products, the two things that most tourist stops have in common are restrooms and items for sale with the name the establishment or other nearby points of interest.
