Scaled Composites' White Knight Two or Eve is the first stage of Tier 1b, a two-stage to suborbital-space manned launch system. It is coupled with SpaceShipTwo to form the full launch package. WK2 is based on the successfulmothership to SpaceShipOne, which itself is based on Proteus. Together WK2 and SS2 form the basis for Virgin Galactic's fleet of suborbital spaceplanes.

Design
White Knight Two is based upon the first White Knight
White Knight Two will be roughly three times larger than White Knight, in order to perform a captive carry with the larger SpaceShipTwo spacecraft. The WK2 will be similar in wingspan to a B29 bomber,;; and will be by far the largest aircraft constructed by Scaled Composites.;;

WK2 will be an aerobatic airplane, and will provide preview flights offering several seconds of weightlessness, before the actual suborbital event. It will have a service ceiling of about 60,000 ft or 18km, offering a dark blue sky to passengers. This would allow tourists to practice before the real flight.;;

White Knight Two will have a twin boom with two jet engines per hull.;; One hull will be an exact replica of that of SpaceShipTwo (to allow tourist training), and the other will carry cut-rate day-trippers into the stratosphere.;;

Commercial introduction
The White Knight Two design is expected to be revealed on January 23, 2008. Construction of the first aircraft is due to complete in June 2008 with the first test flight in July 2008.;;
