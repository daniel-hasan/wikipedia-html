State Route 600 is a secondary state highway in the Eastern Shore of the U.S. state of Virginia. It runs north-south along Seaside Road, lying between U.S. Route 13 (Virginia)|U.S. Route 13 and the Atlantic Ocean, from a dead end at Kiptopeke north to State Route 605 near Locustville. SR 605 continues north on Seaside Road to Accomac, where US 13 leaves its alignment next to the Bay Coast Railroad to run closer to the ocean.

History
Most of SR 600 has never been a primary state highway, but the section from Kiptopeke north to Capeville was part of State Route 186 until the early 1950s, when U.S. Route 13 (Virginia)|U.S. Route 13 was rerouted from the Cape Charles Ferry to the Kiptopeke Ferry. At Capeville, SR 186 turned west on Capeville Drive (part of SR 624), north on present US 13, and north on Fairview Road and Bayview Circle (SR 684 and part of SR 641) to end at US 13 (now U.S. Route 13 Business (Cheriton, Virginia)|U.S. Route 13 Business) south of Cheriton.;[http://lvaimage.lib.va.us/cgi-bin/vhip_annotated/vhip.pl?&amp;map=nth Map of Northampton County], revised July 1, 1936;

The road was added to the state highway system in 1928 (8.90 mi/14.32 km),;, page 32; 1931 (1.00 mi/1.61 km);, page 15; and 1932 (1.30 mi/2.09 km) as State Route 525;;, page 20; it became State Route 186 in the 1933 renumbering. SR 600 was numbered by 1934, and initially ran from SR 186 at Capeville to U.S. Route 13 (Virginia)|U.S. Route 13 in Accomac, using part of current State Route 605 to Accomac.;[http://lvaimage.lib.va.us/cgi-bin/vhip_annotated/vhip.pl?&amp;map=nth Map of Northampton County], revised July 1, 1936;;[http://lvaimage.lib.va.us/cgi-bin/vhip_annotated/vhip.pl?&amp;map=acc Map of Accomac County], revised July 1, 1936;

In 1951, a new highway, until then designated State Route 652, from SR 186 west of Capeville to the Kiptopeke Ferry terminal, was transferred to the primary system as a relocation of US 13, already approved by AASHO.;, page 22; Thus SR 186 north of the junction with the new road became part of US 13 (and the former US 13 became U.S. Route 13 Alternate (Cape Charles, Virginia)|U.S. Route 13 Alternate). The rest of SR 186 was soon transferred to the secondary system as an extension of SR 600 and a small piece of SR 624.;
