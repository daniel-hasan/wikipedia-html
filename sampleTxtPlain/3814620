The impressively tall, craggy featured Josiah Power was one of America’s best lawyers until his metagene was triggered during the alien Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion by the activation of the Gene Bomb.;http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=josiahpower;

Following the untimely public activation of his metagene in the court room, corporate attorney Josiah Power was dismissed from his law firm. Power had little interest in becoming a traditional costumed hero, but it became readily apparent that he could not continue to practice law without undue public attention.

Working his way through a short depression and other problems, Josiah eventually found a way to combine his old skills and newfound abilities. He decided to found a business of ''superheroes for hire'', structured like a law firm, with partners and associates.

He called his new team, the Power Company. During his tenure in the team, he was put into a coma from a gunshot wound and Firestorm became an associate. He has since recovered and has continued active duty. Josiah lives with his life partner Rupert.
