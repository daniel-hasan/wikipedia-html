Belarus () (Belarusian and Russian: Беларусь, BGN/PCGN romanization of Belarusian|transliteration: ''Byelarus’'')is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe,;; that borders Russia to the north and east, Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the north. Its capital is Minsk; other major cities include Brest, Grodno, Gomel, Mogilev, Vitebsk and Bobruisk. A third of the country is forested, and agriculture and manufacturing are its strongest economic sectors.

Until the 20th century, the Belarusians lacked the opportunity to form their national policy;, as the lands of modern-day Belarus belonged to several countries, including the Duchy of Polatsk, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire. After the short-lived Belarusian People's Republic (1918–19), Belarus became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union, the Byelorussian SSR.

The final unification of Belarusian lands within its modern borders took place in 1939, when the ethnically Belarusian lands that were part of interwar Poland were annexed by the USSR and attached to the Soviet Belarus. The territory and its nation were devastated in World War II, during which Belarus lost about a quarter of its population and more than half of its economic resources;;; the republic recovered; in the post-war years and became one of the founding members of the United Nations. The parliament of the republic declared the sovereignty of Belarus on July 27, 1990, and following the History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union, Belarus declared independence on August 25, 1991. Alexander Lukashenko has been the country's president since 1994. During his presidency, Lukashenko has implemented; Soviet-era policies, such as state ownership of the economy, despite objections from Western governments. Since 1996, Belarus is negotiating with Russia to unify into a single state called the Union of Russia and Belarus.

Most of Belarus's population of 9.85&amp;nbsp;million reside in the urban areas surrounding Minsk and other oblast (regional) capitals.; ; More than 80% of the population are native Belarusians, with sizable minorities of Russians, Ukrainians and Poles. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: Belarusian and Russian. The Constitution of Belarus does not declare an official religion, although the primary religion in the country is Russian Orthodox.

Etymology
The name ''Belarus'' derives from the term ''White Russia'', which first appeared in German and Latin medieval literature. The Latin term for the area was ''Russia Alba''. Historically, the country was referred to in English as ''White Russia''. It is also claimed by some people that the correct translation is ''White Ruthenia'' (''White Rus'' phonetically), which either describes the area of Eastern Europe populated by Slavic people or the states that occupied the area.;; The first known use of ''White Russia'' to refer to Belarus was in the late-16th century by Englishman Sir Jerome Horsey.;; During the 17th century, Russian tsars used ''White Rus, asserting that they were trying to recapture their heritage from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.; 

Belarus was named ''Belorussia'' (Russian: Белоруссия) in the days of Imperial Russia, and the Russian tsar was usually styled ''Czar of All the Russias—Great, Little, and White''. ''Belorussia'' was the only Russian language name of the country (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) until 1991, when the Supreme Soviet of the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called ''Belarus'' (Беларусь) in Russian and in all other language transcriptions of its name. The change was made to reflect adequately the Belarusian language form of the name.; ; Accordingly, the name ''Belorussia'' was replaced by ''Belarus'' in English, and, to some extent, in Russian (although the traditional name still persists in that language as well); likewise, the adjective ''Belorussian'' or ''Byelorussian'' was replaced by ''Belarusian'' in English (though Russian has not developed a new adjective). Some Belarusians object to the name ''Belorussia'' as an unwelcome reminder of the days under Russian and Soviet rule.; ; However, most residents of the country do not mind it being called Byelorussiya in Russian (which is, actually, the most widely spoken language there) – it is evidenced by the fact that several popular newspapers published locally still retain the traditional name of the country in Russian in their names (e.g. Komsomolskaya Pravda v Byelorussii, which is the localised publication of a popular Russian tabloid, and Sovetskaya Byelorussiya). Officially, the full name of the country is ''Republic of Belarus'' (Рэспубліка Беларусь, Республика Беларусь, Respublika Byelarus').; ;

The area of modern-day Belarus was first settled by early East Slavs in the 6th century. ;They gradually came into contact with the Varangians, a band of warriors consisting of Scandinavians and Slavs from the Baltics.;; Though defeated and briefly exiled by the local population, the Varangians were later asked to return; and helped to form a polity—commonly referred to as the Kievan Rus'—in exchange for tribute. The Kievan Rus' state began in about 862 at the present-day city of Novgorod.;; 

Upon the death of Kievan Rus' ruler, Prince Yaroslav the Wise, the state split into independent principalities.;; These Ruthenian principalities were badly affected by a Mongol invasion in the 13th century, and many were later incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.;; Of all the principalities held by the Duchy, nine were settled by ancestors of the Belarusian people.;; During this time, the Duchy was involved in several military campaigns, including fighting on the side of Poland against the Teutonic Knights at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410. The joint victory allowed the Duchy to control the northwestern border lands of Eastern Europe.;; 

On February 2, 1386, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland were joined in a personal union through a marriage of their rulers.;; This union set in motion the developments that eventually resulted in the formation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, created in 1569. The Russians, led by Tsar Ivan the III, began military conquests in 1486 in an attempt to gain the Kievan Rus' lands, specifically Belarus and Ukraine.; ; The union between Poland and Lithuania ended in 1795, and the commonwealth was partitioned by Imperial Russia, Prussia, and Austria, dividing Belarus.;; Belarusian territories were acquired by the Russian Empire during the reign of Catherine II;; and held until their occupation by Germany during World War I.;;

During the negotiations of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Belarus first declared independence on 25 March 1918, forming the Belarusian People's Republic. The Germans supported the BPR, which lasted for about 10 months.;(Birgerson 2002:105–106''); Soon after the Germans were defeated, the BPR fell under the influence of the Bolsheviks and the Red Army and became the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1919.; After Russian occupation of eastern and northern Lithuania, it was merged into the Lithuanian-Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Byelorussian lands were then split between Poland and the Soviets after the Polish-Soviet War ended in 1921, and the recreated Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922.; 

In September 1939, as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union invaded Poland and annexed its eastern lands, including most of Polish-held Byelorussian land.;(Olson 1994:95); Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. Byelorussia was the hardest hit Soviet Republic in the war and remained in Nazi hands until 1944. During that time, Germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic, 85% of the republic's industry, and more than one million buildings, while causing human losses estimated between two and three million (about a quarter to one-third of the total population).; These huge losses were due to Byelorussia's direct path between Berlin and Moscow and to purges ordered by Stalin that caused 300,000 Belarusians to either disappear or perish.; The Jewish population of Byelorussia was devastated during The Holocaust and never recovered.;; The population of Belarus did not regain its pre-war level until 1971.; After the war ended, Byelorussia was among the 51 founding signatories of the United Nations Charter in 1945 and began rebuilding the Soviet Republic. During this time, the Byelorussian SSR became a major center of manufacturing in the western region of the USSR, increasing jobs and bringing an influx of ethnic Russians into the republic.;; The borders of Byelorussian SSR and Poland were redrawn to a point known as the Curzon Line.;

Joseph Stalin implemented a policy of Sovietization to isolate the Byelorussian SSR from Western influences.; ; This policy involved sending Russians from various parts of the Soviet Union and placing them in key positions in the Byelorussian SSR government. The official use of the Belarusian language and other cultural aspects were limited by Moscow. After Stalin died in 1953, successor Nikita Khrushchev continued this program, stating, &quot;The sooner we all start speaking Russian, the faster we shall build communism&quot;.; When Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev began pushing through his reform plan, the Belarusian people delivered a petition to him in December 1986 explaining the loss of their culture. Earlier that year, Byelorussian SSR was exposed to nuclear fallout from the explosion at the Chernobyl power plant in neighboring Ukrainian SSR.; ; In June 1988 at the city of Kurapaty, archaeologist Zianon Pazniak, the leader of Christian Conservative Party of the BPF, discovered mass graves which contained about 250,000 bodies of victims executed in 1941.; Some nationalists contend that this discovery is proof that the Soviet government was trying to erase the Belarusian people, causing Belarusian nationalists to seek independence.;{Birgerson 2002:99);

Two years later, in March 1990, elections for seats in the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR took place. Though the pro-independence Belarusian Popular Front took only 10% of the seats, the populace was content with the selection of the delegates.; ; Belarus declared itself sovereign on July 27, 1990, by issuing the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. With the support of the Communist Party, the country's name was changed to the Republic of Belarus on August 25, 1991.; Stanislav Shushkevich, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus, met with Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine on December 8, 1991, in Belavezhskaya Pushcha to formally declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States.; A national constitution was adopted in March 1994, in which the office of prime minister was replaced by that of president.

Two-round elections for the presidency (24 June 1994 and 10 July 1994); ; resulted in the politically unknown Alexander Lukashenko winning more than 45 % of the vote in the first round and 80 %; in the second round, beating Vyacheslav Kebich who got 14 %. Lukashenko remains in office, having been reelected in 2001 and in 2006.

Politics

Belarus is a presidential republic, governed by a president and the National Assembly. The National Assembly is a bicameral parliament comprising the 110-member House of Representatives (the lower house) and the 64-member Council of the Republic (the upper house). The House of Representatives has the power to appoint the prime minister, make constitutional amendments, call for a vote of confidence on the prime minister, and make suggestions on foreign and domestic policy. The Council of the Republic has the power to select various government officials, conduct an impeachment trial of the president, and accept or reject the bills passed by the House of Representatives. Each chamber has the ability to veto any law passed by local officials if it is contrary to the Constitution of Belarus.; ; Since 1994, Alexander Lukashenko has been the president of Belarus. The government includes a Council of Ministers, headed by the prime minister. The members of this council need not be members of the legislature and are appointed by the president. The judiciary comprises the Supreme Court and specialized courts such as the Constitutional Court, which deals with specific issues related to constitutional and business law. The judges of national courts are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic. For criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the Supreme Court. The Belarusian Constitution forbids the use of special extra-judicial courts.;

As of 2007, 98 of the 110 members the House of Representatives are not affiliated with any political party. Of the remaining twelve members, eight belong to the Communist Party of Belarus, three to the Agrarian Party of Belarus, and one to the Liberal Democratic Party of Belarus. Neither the pro-Lukashenko parties, such as the Belarusian Socialist Sporting Party and the Republican Party of Labor and Justice, nor the People's Coalition 5 Plus opposition parties, such as the Belarusian People's Front and the United Civil Party of Belarus, won any seats in the Elections in Belarus#Elections of 2004|2004 elections. Organizations such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) declared the election &quot;un-free&quot; because of the opposition parties' poor results and media bias in favor of the government.;; In the country's 2006 presidential election, Lukashenko was opposed by Alexander Milinkevich, a candidate representing a coalition of opposition parties, and by Alaksandar Kazulin of the Social Democrats. Kazulin was detained and beaten by police during protests surrounding the All Belarusian People's Assembly. Lukashenko won the election with 80% of the vote, but the OSCE and other organizations called the election unfair.;; 

Lukashenko has described himself as having an &quot;authoritarian ruling style&quot;.;; Western countries have described Belarus under Lukashenko as a dictatorship; the government has accused the same Western powers of trying to oust Lukashenko.;; The Council of Europe has barred Belarus from membership since 1997 for undemocratic voting and election irregularities in the November 1996 constitutional referendum and parliament by-elections.;; The Belarusian government is also criticized for human rights violations and its actions against non-governmental organizations, independent journalists, national minorities, and opposition politicians.; ;; ; Belarus is the only nation in Europe that retains the death penalty for certain crimes during times of peace and war.; ; In testimony to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice labeled Belarus, among six nations, as part of the &quot;outposts of tyranny&quot;.;; In response, the Belarusian government called the assessment &quot;quite far from reality&quot;.;;

Belarus and Russia have been close trading partners and diplomatic allies since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Belarus is dependent on Russia for imports of raw materials and for its export market.;; The Union of Russia and Belarus, a supranational confederation, was established in a 1996&amp;ndash;99 series of treaties that called for monetary union, equal rights, single citizenship, and a common foreign and defense policy.; Although the future of the Union was in doubt because of Belarus' repeated delays of monetary union, the lack of a referendum date for the draft constitution, and a Russia-Belarus energy dispute|2006–07 dispute about petroleum trade.; On December 11, 2007, reports emerged that a framework for the new state was discussed between both countries.;; 

Belarus was a founder member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS); however, recently other CIS members have questioned the effectiveness of the organization.;; Belarus has trade agreements with several European Union member states (despite other member states' travel ban on Lukashenko and top officials),;); as well as with its neighbors Lithuania, Poland and Latvia.; ; 

Bilateral relations with the United States are strained because of the United States State Department's support for various pro-democracy non-governmental organization|NGOs and because the Belarusian government made it harder for US-based organizations to operate within the country.; ; The 2004 US Belarus Democracy Act continued this trend, authorizing funding for pro-democracy Belarusian NGOs and forbidding loans to the Belarusian government except for humanitarian purposes.;; Despite this, the two nations cooperate on intellectual property protection, prevention of human trafficking and technology crime, and disaster relief.; ; 

Belarus has increased cooperation with China, strengthened by the visit of President Lukashenko to China in October 2005.;; Belarus has strong ties with Syria,;; which President Lukashenko considers a key partner in the Middle East.;; In addition to the CIS, Belarus has membership in the Eurasian Economic Community and the Collective Security Treaty Organization.; Belarus has been a member of the international Non-Aligned Movement since 1998;; and a member of the United Nations since its founding in 1945.; ; 

The Armed Forces of Belarus has three branches: the Army, the Air Force, and the Ministry of Defense joint staff. Colonel-General Leonid Maltsev heads the Ministry of Defense,; ; and Alexander Lukashenko (as president) serves as Commander-in-Chief.; ; The Armed Forces was formed in 1992 using parts of the former Soviet Armed Forces on the new republic's territory. The transformation of the ex-Soviet forces into the Armed Forces of Belarus, which was completed in 1997, reduced the number of its soldiers by 30,000 and restructured its leadership and military formations.; ; Most of Belarus's service members are conscripts, who serve for 12 months if they have higher education or 18 months if they do not.;Routledge, IISS Military Balance 2007, p.158–159; However, demographic decreases in the Belarusians of conscription age have increased the importance of contract soldiers, who numbered 12,000 as of 2001.;; In 2005, about 1.4% of Belarus's gross domestic product was devoted to military expenditures.; ; Belarus has not expressed a desire to join NATO but has participated in the Individual Partnership Program since 1997.; ; 

Provinces and districts


Provinces of Belarus
Belarus is divided into six ''voblasts'', or provinces, which are named after the cities that serve as their administrative centers.; ; Each voblast has a provincial legislative authority, called an ''oblsovet'', which is elected by the voblast's residents, and a provincial executive authority called a voblast administration, whose leader is appointed by the president.; ; Voblasts are further subdivided into ''raions'' (commonly translated as ''districts'' or ''regions'').; As with voblasts, each raion has its own legislative authority (''raisovet'', or raion council) elected by its residents, and an executive authority (raion administration) appointed by higher executive powers. As of 2002, there are six voblasts, 118 raions, 102 towns and 108 urbanized settlements.;; Minsk is given a special status, due to the city serving as the national capital. Minsk City is ran by an executive committee and granted a charter of self-rule by the national government.; ;

Belarus is landlocked, relatively flat, and contains large tracts of marshy land.;; According to a 1994 estimate by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, 34% of Belarus is covered by forests.;; Many streams and 11,000 lakes are found in Belarus.; Three major rivers run through the country: the Neman, the Pripyat, and the Dnepr. The Neman and the Pripyat flow eastward to the Dnepr; the Dnepr flows southward towards the Black Sea.; Belarus's highest point is Dzyarzhynskaya Hara (Dzyarzhynsk Hill) at , and its lowest point is on the Neman River at .; The average elevation of Belarus isabove sea level.;(Zaprudnik, xix); The climate ranges from harsh winters, with average January temperatures at , to cool and moist summers with the average temperature of .; ; Belarus experiences an average rainfall of 550 to 700&amp;nbsp;millimeters (21.7 to 27.5&amp;nbsp;inches).; The country experiences a yearly transition from a continental climate to a maritime climate.;

Belarus's natural resources include peat deposits, small quantities of oil and natural gas, granite, dolomite (limestone), marl, chalk, sand, gravel, and clay.; About 70% of the radiation from neighboring Ukraine's 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster entered Belarusian territory, and as of 2005 about a fifth of Belarusian land (principally farmland and forests in the southeastern provinces) continues to be affected by radiation fallout.;; The United Nations and other agencies have aimed to reduce the level of radiation in affected areas, especially through the use of cesium binders and rapeseed cultivation, which are meant to decrease soil levels of cesium-137.;;;; 

Belarus is bordered by Latvia on the north, Lithuania on the northwest, Poland on the west, Russia on the north and east and Ukraine on the south. Treaties in 1995 and 1996 demarcated Belarus's borders with Latvia and Lithuania, but Belarus failed to ratify a 1997 treaty establishing the Belarus-Ukraine border.; ; Belarus and Lithuania ratified final border demarcation documents in February 2007.; ; 

Economy
