= The Selected Poems of Oleh Lysheha (1999)=
Literary reviewers have written that &quot;The Selected Poems of Oleh Lysheha&quot; - the English translations of Lysheha - have nothing in common with the Ukrainian poetic tradition.As Bondar, for example, notes the poetry is &quot;influenced by natural philosophy, shamanistic meditation, total denial of a technocratic world, and escapism.&quot;;Lyshaha's publisher Harvard University Press describes the poet's work as &quot;informed by transcendentalism and Zen-like introspection, with meditations on the essence of the human experience and man's place in nature.&quot;;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/LYSCOL.html The Selected Poetry of Oleh Lysheha] ''Harvard University Press''. Accessed:7 June 2007.;

A presentation of the award was held May 15 at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City.;[http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/2001/010127.shtml 2000: THE YEAR IN REVIEW:A look at the cultural scene: from art to the theater].

After dining in the moonlight,;
He sorted the bones —;
The small and the larger separated accurately;
On ground that was still warm —;
What if someone should come along and decide;
To carve a hole in one;
| &amp;nbsp;
|
And make a flute..;
To greet the dawn..;
Otherwise things were the same —;
The wild garlic was growing darker, the blackberries were filling out..;
And his paw was still strong enough,;
To protect the night..
