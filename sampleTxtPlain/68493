Findlaw.com.Retrieved 2007-01-26;According to the''Roe'' decision, most laws against abortion in the United States violated a constitutional right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.The decision overturned all state and federal laws outlawing or restricting abortion that were inconsistent with its holdings. ''Roe v. Wade'' is one of the most controversial and politically significant cases in U.S. Supreme Court history. Its lesser-known companion case, ''Doe v. Bolton'', was decided at the same time.;''Doe v. Bolton'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=410&amp;invol=179 410 U.S. 179] (1973).

The central holding of ''Roe v. Wade'' was that abortions are permissible for any reason a woman chooses, up until the &quot;point at which the fetus becomes ‘viable,’ that is, potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. Fetus#Viability|Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.&quot;;The Court also held that abortion after viability must be available when needed to protect a woman's health, Doe v. Bolton#Broad definition of health|which the Court defined broadly in the companion case of ''Doe v. Bolton''.These court rulings affected laws in 46 states.;William Mears and Bob Franken, [http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/01/21/roevwade.overview/ “30 years after ruling, ambiguity, anxiety surround abortion debate”], CNN (2003-01-22): “In all, the Roe and Doe rulings impacted laws in 46 states.”; 

The ''Roe v. Wade'' decision prompted national debate that continues to this day. Debated subjects include whether and to what extent abortion should be illegal, who should decide whether or not abortion is illegal, what methods the Supreme Court should use in constitutional adjudication, and what the role should be of religious and moral views in the political sphere. ''Roe v. Wade'' reshaped national politics, dividing much of the nation into pro-''Roe'' (mostly pro-choice) and anti-''Roe'' (mostly pro-life) camps, and inspiring grassroots activism on both sides.

History of case

In 1970, attorneys Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington filed suit in a U.S. District Court in Texas on behalf of Norma L. McCorvey (&quot;Jane Roe&quot;).The defendant in the case was Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade, representing the State of Texas.

The district court ruled in McCorvey's favor, but refused to grant an injunction against the enforcement of the laws barring abortion.;''Roe v. Wade'',314 F. Supp. 1217 (1970), http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Roe.pdf (PDF courtesy link).

Supreme Court decision	
Harry Blackmun wrote the Court’s opinion.The court issued its decision on January 22, 1973, with a 7 to 2 majority voting to strike down Texas abortion laws.Burger and Douglas' concurring opinion and White's dissenting opinion were issued separately, in the companion case of ''Doe v. Bolton''.

The ''Roe'' Court deemed abortion a fundamental right under the United States Constitution, thereby subjecting all laws attempting to restrict it to the standard of strict scrutiny. Although abortion is still considered a fundamental right, subsequent cases, notably ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey|Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey'', ''Stenberg v. Carhart'', and ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' have affected the legal standard.

The opinion of the ''Roe'' Court, written by Justice Harry Blackmun, declined to adopt the district court's Ninth Amendment rationale, and instead asserted that the &quot;right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.&quot;Douglas, in his concurring opinion from the companion case ''Doe v. Bolton'', stated more emphatically that, &quot;The Ninth Amendment obviously does not create federally enforceable rights.&quot;Thus, the ''Roe'' majority rested its opinion squarely on the Constitution's due process clause.

According to the ''Roe'' Court, &quot;the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage.&quot; Abortion in the United States#Abortion before Roe|Abortion before ''Roe'' had been subject to criminal statutes since at least the nineteenth century.Section VI of Blackmun's opinion was devoted to an analysis of historical attitudes, including those of the Persian Empire, Greek times, the Roman era, the Hippocratic oath, the common law, English statutory law, American law, the American Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, and the American Bar Association.

Without finding what it deemed a sufficient historical basis to justify the Texas statute, the Court identified three possible justifications in Section VII of the opinion to explain the criminalization of abortion: (1) women who can receive an abortion are more likely to engage in &quot;illicit sexual conduct&quot;; (2) the medical procedure was extremely risky prior to the development of antibiotics and, even with modern medical techniques, is still risky in late stages of pregnancy; and (3) the state has an interest in protecting prenatal life. To the first, Blackmun wrote that &quot;no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously&quot; and the statute failed to &quot;distinguish between married and unwed mothers&quot;; according to the Court, the second and third constitute valid state interests. In Section X, the Court reiterated, &quot;[T]he State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman ... and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.&quot;

Although the Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy, the Court had previously found support for various privacy rights in several provisions of the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as in the &quot;penumbra&quot; of the Bill of Rights. But instead of relying upon the Bill of Rights or &quot;penumbras, formed by emanations&quot;, as the Court had done in ''Griswold v. Connecticut'', the ''Roe'' Court relied on a &quot;right of privacy&quot; that it said was located in the due process clause of the Constitution.

The Court determined that &quot;arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are unpersuasive&quot;, and declared, &quot;We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.&quot; 

When weighing the competing interests that the Court had identified, Blackmun also asserted that if the fetus was defined as a person for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment then the fetus would have a specific right to life under that Amendment.However, the Court majority determined that the original intent of the Constitution (up to the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868) did not include the unborn.

The Court's determination of whether a fetus can enjoy constitutional protection was separate from the notion of when life begins: &quot;We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.&quot;The Court only believed itself positioned to resolve the question of when a right to abortion begins.

The decision established a system of trimesters that attempted to balance the state's legitimate interests against the abortion right.The Court ruled that the state cannot restrict a woman's right to an abortion during the first trimester, the state can regulate the abortion procedure during the second trimester &quot;in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health&quot;, and the state can choose to restrict or proscribe abortion as it sees fit during the third trimester when the fetus is viable (&quot;except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother&quot;).

=Justiciability=
An aspect of the decision that attracted comparatively little attention was the Court's disposition of the issues of standing and mootness. The Supreme Court does not issue advisory opinions (those stating what the law would be in some hypothetical circumstance). Instead, there must be an actual &quot;case or controversy&quot;, including particularly a plaintiff who is aggrieved and seeks relief. In the ''Roe'' case, &quot;Jane Roe&quot;, who began the litigation in March 1970, had already given birth by the time the case was argued before the Supreme Court in December 1971. By the traditional rules, therefore, there was an argument that Roe's appeal was moot because she would not be affected by the ruling, and also because she lacked standing to assert the rights of other pregnant women.;Abernathy, M. et al., ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0872498549&amp;id=tHhlYpWokFIC&amp;pg=RA1-PA4&amp;lpg=RA1-PA4&amp;ots=OeQSTLp91C&amp;dq=standing+and+mootness+and+%22roe+v.+wade%22&amp;num=100&amp;sig=gfDTMq-LyUVI-lg8tNreUQFjX6c Civil Liberties Under the Constitution]'' (U. South Carolina 1993), page 4.Retrieved 2007-02-04.;

The Court concluded that the case came within an established exception to the rule; one that allowed consideration of an issue that was &quot;capable of repetition, yet evading review.&quot; This phrase had been coined in 1911 by Justice Joseph McKenna.;''Southern Pacific v. Interstate Commerce Commission'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=219&amp;invol=498 219 U.S. 498] (1911).Findlaw.com.Retrieved 2007-01-26; Blackmun's opinion quoted McKenna, and noted that pregnancy would normally conclude more quickly than an appellate process: &quot;If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied.&quot; This ruling was critical to the Supreme Court's power to review the case.

Dissents
Byron White was the senior dissenting justice.
Associate Justices Byron R. White and William H. Rehnquist wrote emphatic dissenting opinions in this case.Justice White wrote:



White asserted that the Court &quot;values the convenience of the pregnant mother more than the continued existence and development of the life or potential life that she carries.&quot; Despite White suggesting he &quot;might agree&quot; with the Court's values and priorities, he wrote that he saw &quot;no constitutional warrant for imposing such an order of priorities on the people and legislatures of the States.&quot;White criticized the Court for involving itself in this issue by creating &quot;a constitutional barrier to state efforts to protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with the constitutionally protected right to exterminate it.&quot;He would have left this issue, for the most part, &quot;with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs.&quot;

Rehnquist elaborated upon several of White's points, by asserting that the Court's historical analysis was flawed:

 

From this historical record, Rehnquist concluded that, &quot;There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted.&quot; Therefore, in his view, &quot;the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter.&quot;

Controversy
A criticism of Roe v. Wade (though not one made by the dissenting Justices in the case) is that the majority opinion failed to adequately recognize the inviolability and personhood of embryonic/fetal human life. Some pro-life supporters argue that life begins at conception, and thus the unborn should be entitled to legal protection. Other pro-life supporters argue that, in the absence of definite knowledge of when life begins, it is best to avoid the risk of doing harm.;Reagan, Ronald. ''[http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/10456929?tab=holdings Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation]'', (Nelson 1984): &quot;If you don't know whether a body is alive or dead, you would never bury it.

Supporters describe Roe as vital to preservation of women's rights, personal freedom, and privacy.

Opponents of ''Roe'' have objected that the decision lacks a valid Constitutional foundation.Like the dissenters in ''Roe'', they have maintained that the Constitution is silent on the issue, and that proper solutions to the question would best be found via state legislatures and the democratic process, rather than through an all-encompassing ruling from the Supreme Court. Supporters of ''Roe'' contend that the decision has a valid constitutional foundation, or contend that justification for the result in ''Roe'' could be found in the Constitution but not in the articles referenced in the decision.;''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0814799183&amp;id=Us-277i9ZJYC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=P3h5hDqS1u&amp;dq=%22what+roe+v.+wade+should+have+said%22&amp;num=100&amp;sig=gJ9jX7_d2MOXAkvWRgkwiDYImPs What Roe v.

In response to ''Roe v. Wade'', most states enacted or attempted to enact laws limiting or regulating abortion, such as laws requiring parental consent for minors to obtain abortions, parental notification laws, spousal mutual consent laws, spousal notification laws, laws requiring abortions to be performed in hospitals but not clinics, laws barring state funding for abortions, laws banning abortions utilizing intact dilation and extraction procedures (often referred to as partial-birth abortion), laws requiring waiting periods before abortion, or laws mandating women read certain types of literature before choosing an abortion.;Guttmacher Institute, &quot;[http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OAL.pdf State Policies in Brief, An Overview of Abortion Laws (PDF)]&quot;, published 2007-01-01. Retrieved 2007-01-26.; Congress in 1976 passed the Hyde Amendment, barring federal funding of abortions for poor women through the Medicaid program. The Supreme Court struck down several state restrictions on abortions in a long series of cases stretching from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, but upheld restrictions on funding, including the Hyde Amendment, in the case of ''Harris v. McRae'' (1980).;''Harris v. McRae'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=448&amp;invol=297 448 U.S. 297] (1980).Findlaw.com.Retrieved 2007-01-26.;

The most prominent organized groups that mobilized in response to ''Roe'' are the NARAL Pro-Choice America|National Abortion Rights Action League on the pro-choice side, and the National Right to Life Committee on the pro-life side.During his life, Harry Blackmun, author of the ''Roe'' opinion, was a determined advocate for the decision.Others have joined him in support of ''Roe'', including Judith Jarvis Thomson, who before the decision had offered an influential defense of abortion.;Thomson, Judith. &quot;A Defense of Abortion,&quot; in ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'', vol. 1, no. 1 (1971), pp. 47–66.;

=Internal memoranda=
Internal Supreme Court memoranda surfaced in the Library of Congress in 1988, among the personal papers of Douglas and other Justices, showing the private discussions of the Justices on the case. Blackmun said of the majority decision he authored, &quot;You will observe that I have concluded that the end of the first trimester is critical. This is arbitrary, but perhaps any other selected point, such as quickening or viability, is equally arbitrary.&quot;;Woodward, Bob. &quot;[http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~rauch/nvp/roe/woodward.html The Abortion Papers]&quot;, ''Washington Post'' (1989-01-22).Retrieved 2007-02-03.;Stewart said the lines were &quot;legislative&quot; and wanted more flexibility and consideration paid to the state legislatures, though he joined Blackmun's decision.;Kmiec, Douglas. &quot;[http://members.aol.com/abtrbng2/roememos.txt Testimony Before Subcommittee on the Constitution, Judiciary Committee, U.S. House of Representatives]&quot; (1996-04-22), via the &quot;Abortion Law Homepage&quot;.Retrieved 2007-01-23.; 

The assertion that the Supreme Court was making a legislative decision is often repeated by opponents of the Court's decision.;Bush, George Walker. Quoted in ''Boston Globe'', p. A12 (2000-01-22). &quot;Roe v. Wade was wrong because it 'usurped the power of the legislatures,' Bush said. 'I felt like it was a case where the court took the place of what legislatures should do in America,' he said. But Bush refused to say how he felt each state should act. Instead, he said that when it comes to legalizing abortion, 'it should be up to each legislature.'&quot;Retrieved 2007-02-02.; The &quot;viability&quot; criterion, which Blackmun acknowledged was arbitrary, is still in effect, although the point of viability has changed as medical science has found ways to help premature babies survive.;Stith, Irene.

As constitutional argument, Roe is barely coherent. The court pulled its fundamental right to choose more or less from the constitutional ether. It supported that right via a lengthy, but purposeless, cross-cultural historical review of abortion restrictions and a tidy but irrelevant refutation of the straw-man argument that a fetus is a constitutional ‘person’ entited to the protection of the 14th Amendment....By declaring an inviolable fundamental right to abortion, Roe short-circuited the democratic deliberation that is the most reliable method of deciding questions of competing values.&quot;Retrieved 2007-01-23.; have also expressed disappointment with ''Roe''.

Public opinion



An October 2007 Harris poll on ''Roe v. Wade'', asked the following question:



In reply, 56 percent of respondents indicated favor while 40 percent indicated opposition.The Harris organization concluded from this poll that &quot;56 percent now favors the U.S. Supreme Court decision&quot;.Pro-life activists have disputed whether the Harris poll question is a valid measure of public opinion about ''Roe's'' overall decision, because the question focuses only on the first three months of pregnancy.;Franz, Wanda.[http://www.nrlc.org/news/2007/NRL06/PresidentColumn.html &quot;The Continuing Confusion About Roe v.

Opposition to ''Roe'' on the bench grew when President Reagan &amp;mdash; who supported legislative restrictions on abortion &amp;mdash; made federal judicial appointments.Reagan denied that there was any litmus test: &quot;I have never given a litmus test to anyone that I have appointed to the bench…. I feel very strongly about those social issues, but I also place my confidence in the fact that the one thing that I do seek are judges that will interpret the law and not write the law.We've had too many examples in recent years of courts and judges legislating.&quot;;Reagan, Ronald.''[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1986/62386e.htm Interview With Eleanor Clift, Jack Nelson, and Joel Havemann of the Los Angeles Times]'' (1986-06-23).Retrieved 2007-01-23.;

In addition to White and Rehnquist, Reagan appointee Sandra Day O'Connor began dissenting from the Court's abortion cases, arguing that the trimester-based analysis devised by the ''Roe'' Court was &quot;unworkable.&quot;;''Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health Inc.'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=462&amp;invol=416 462 U.S. 416] (1983).Findlaw.com.Retrieved 2007-01-26.;Shortly before his retirement from the bench, Chief Justice Warren Burger suggested that ''Roe'' be &quot;reexamined&quot;;;''Thornburgh v.

Kennedy. 

In Canada, its Supreme Court used the rulings in both ''Roe'' and ''Doe v. Bolton'' as grounds to find Canada's federal law restricting access to abortions unconstitutional in ''R. v. Morgentaler'' (1 S.C.R. 30) 1988, and to find provisional restrictions on abortion also unconstitutional, ''R. v. Morgentaler (1993)''.

=''Webster v. Reproductive Health Services''=
In a 5-4 decision in 1989's ''Webster v. Reproductive Health Services'', Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, declined to explicitly overrule ''Roe'', because &quot;none of the challenged provisions of the Missouri Act properly before us conflict with the Constitution.&quot;;''Webster v. Reproductive Health Services'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=492&amp;page=490 492 U.S. 490] (1989).Findlaw.com.Retrieved 2007-02-02.;In this case, the Court upheld several abortion restrictions, and modified the ''Roe'' trimester framework.;

In concurring opinions, O'Connor refused to reconsider ''Roe'', and Justice Antonin Scalia criticized the Court and O'Connor for not overruling ''Roe''.;Blackmun &amp;mdash; author of the ''Roe'' opinion &amp;mdash; stated in his dissent that White, Kennedy and Rehnquist were &quot;callous&quot; and &quot;deceptive,&quot; that they deserved to be charged with &quot;cowardice and illegitimacy,&quot; and that their plurality opinion &quot;foments disregard for the law.&quot;;White had recently opined that Blackmun was &quot;warped.&quot;;

=''Planned Parenthood v. Casey''=
With the retirement of ''Roe'' supporters William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, and their replacement by David Souter and Clarence Thomas, pro-choice advocates viewed ''Roe'' for the first time as being in danger.;Wattleton, Faye. [http://a255.g.akamaitech.net/7/255/2422/19sep20050805/www.gpoaccess.gov/congress/senate/judiciary/sh102-1084pt2/533-541.pdf Testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee on the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court (PDF)] (1991-09-19).Retrieved 2007-02-02.;During the confirmation hearings of David Souter, NOW president Molly Yard declared that confirming Souter would mean &quot;ending freedom for women in this country.&quot;;Yard, Molly.

According to NPR, in deliberations for ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' (1992), an initial majority of five Justices that would have overturned ''Roe'' foundered when Justice Kennedy switched sides.;Totenberg, Nina. &quot;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1745254 Documents Reveal Battle to Preserve 'Roe'; Court Nearly Reversed Abortion Ruling, Blackmun Papers Show]&quot;, ''NPR's Morning Edition'' (2004-03-04).Retrieved 2007-01-30.;O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter joined Blackmun and Stevens to reaffirm the central holding of ''Roe'', saying, &quot;At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.&quot;;''Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=505&amp;page=833 505 U.S. 833] (1992).Retrieved 2007-02-03.;Rehnquist and Scalia signed each others' dissenting opinions; White and Thomas signed those dissenting opinions as well.

Scalia's dissent acknowledged that abortion rights are of &quot;great importance to many women&quot;, but asserted that it is not a liberty protected by the Constitution, because the Constitution does not mention it, and because longstanding traditions have permitted it to be legally proscribed.Scalia concluded: &quot;by foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue arouses, by banishing the issue from the political forum that gives all participants, even the losers, the satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight, by continuing the imposition of a rigid national rule instead of allowing for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs and intensifies the anguish.&quot;;

=''Stenberg v. Carhart''=
During the 1990s, Nebraska attempted to ban certain second-trimester abortion procedures sometimes called partial birth abortions.The Nebraska ban allowed other second-trimester abortion procedures called dilation and evacuation abortions.Ginsburg (who replaced White) stated, &quot;this law does not save any fetus from destruction, for it targets only 'a method of performing abortion'.&quot;;''Stenberg v. Carhart'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=530&amp;page=914 530 U.S. 914] (2000).Retrieved 2007-02-02.;The Supreme Court struck down the Nebraska ban by a 5-4 vote in ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' (2000), citing a right to use the safest method of abortion.

Kennedy, who had co-authored the 5-4 ''Casey'' decision upholding ''Roe'', was among the dissenters in ''Stenberg'', writing that Nebraska had done nothing unconstitutional.;Kennedy described the second trimester abortion procedure that Nebraska was ''not'' seeking to prohibit: &quot;The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or child would: It bleeds to death as it is torn from limb from limb. The fetus can be alive at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can survive for a time while its limbs are being torn off.&quot;Kennedy wrote that since this dilation and evacuation procedure remained available in Nebraska, the state was free to ban the other procedure known as partial birth abortion.;

The remaining three dissenters in ''Stenberg'' &amp;mdash; Thomas, Scalia, and Rehnquist &amp;mdash; disagreed again with ''Roe'': &quot;Although a State may permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State must do so.&quot;

=''Gonzales v. Carhart''=
In 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which led to a lawsuit in the case of ''Gonzales v. Carhart''.The Court had previously ruled in ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban would not allow for the health of the mother.The membership of the Court changed after ''Stenberg'', with John Roberts and Samuel Alito replacing Rehnquist and O'Connor, respectively.Further, the ban at issue in ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' was a federal statute, rather than a relatively vague state statute as in the ''Stenberg'' case.

On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a 5 to 4 decision upholding the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left the door open for as-applied challenges.Kennedy's opinion did not reach the question whether the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'', ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', and ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' were valid, and instead the Court said that the challenged statute is consistent with those prior decisions whether or not those prior decisions were valid.

Joining the majority were Chief Justice John Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito. Ginsburg and the other three justices dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent, and also offering an equality-based justification for that abortion precedent. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'' and ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause.

=Activities of Norma McCorvey=

Norma McCorvey became a member of the pro-life movement in 1995; she now supports making abortion illegal.In 1998, she testified to Congress:



As a party to the original litigation, she sought to reopen the case in U.S. District Court in Texas to have ''Roe v. Wade'' overturned.However, the Fifth Circuit decided that her case was moot, in ''McCorvey v. Hill''.;''McCorvey v. Hill'',[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/5th/0310711p.pdf 385 F3d 846 (PDF)] (5th Cir 2004).Findlaw.com.Retrieved 2007-01-26;In a concurring opinion, Judge Edith Jones agreed that McCorvey was raising legitimate questions about emotional and other harm suffered by women who have had abortions, about increased resources available for the care of unwanted children, and about new scientific understanding of fetal development, but Jones said she was compelled to agree that the case was moot.On February 22, 2005, the Supreme Court refused to grant a writ of certiorari, and McCorvey's appeal ended.

=State abortion bans=
