Early years
Image:Claude Vorilhon (right).png|thumb|left|Raël/Claude Vorilhon (right)
The beginnings of Raëlian history goes back to the history of Raël, which concerns the origins of Raël, his personage, and his works, which developed from Claude Vorilhon.The personage purportedly began as the result of encounters described in Raelian Messages, mainly from ''The Book Which Tells the Truth'' (1974) and ''Extraterrestrials Took Me to their Planet'' (1975).None of these encounters is verified from a factual standpoint but they tie in to the beliefs of Raëlians.

Raëlian books are a primary source of Raël's history.Translated portions of the original text are distributed freely worldwide in 33 languages through HTTP.;[http://rael.org/download.php The Raelian Movement: Downloads], ''The International Raëlian Movement''. 2007. Retrieved 3 April 2007.; Some of the books include the contents of multiple Raëlian Church|Raelian books and have testimonials, footnotes, updates, and hyperlinks appended to them.In addition to the Raëlian books, a Canadian sociologist named Susan J. Palmer writes about Raël's struggle to organize the young Raëlian movement.;Palmer, pp. 37-8, 57.;

=Founding=
According to Raëlian beliefs, on the morning of December 13, 1973 (Julian Date 2442029),;In France, Julian Dates 2442030 and 2442696 begin at 1:00 P.m. on December 13, 1973 and October 10, 1975, respectively. All times are GMT +1:00.; Claude Vorilhon &amp;mdash; who was at the time a professional test driver and automobile journalist for the Autopop Magazine &amp;mdash; had a first meeting with an extraterrestrial humanoid, an Eloha (plural: Elohim), who landed a UFO within an inactive volcano called :fr:Puy de Lassolas|Puy de Lassolas near the capital of Auvergne, France (Clermont-Ferrand).;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 3-9.;

Two days later, in the third meeting, an Eloha referred to similar insignias: one engraved his spaceship and one on his spacesuit.Both were formed by interlocked triangles which according to the Eloha, means &quot;as above, so below&quot; enclosing swastika which means &quot;all is cyclic in infinite time&quot;. In Raëlism, the swastika symbolizes, &quot;The choice between paradise, which the peaceful use of science makes possible, and the hell of returning to the primitive stage where humanity submits to nature instead of dominating and benefiting from it.&quot; This is the original emblem of the Raelian Movement which is used primarily in the African and Asian continents.;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 62.; 

Three days later, Claude Vorilhon meets Yahweh Elohim for the last time that year on a Tuesday. On that day, Vorilhon was given the name for the religious movement which he was to establish. The six-letter name is &quot;MADECH&quot;, which stands for &quot;''m''ouvement pour l‘''a''ccueil ''d''es ''E''lohim ''c''réateurs de l’''h''umanité&quot; or &quot;movement for welcoming the Elohim, creators of humanity&quot;. It also stands for &quot;''M''oise ''a'' ''d''evancé ''E''lie et le ''Ch''rist&quot; meaning &quot;Moses preceded Elijah and the Christ&quot;.The &quot;New Commandments&quot; presented to him on that Tuesday concerned the establishment of Geniocracy, Economic Humanitarianism, World Government, and his mission to catalyze these endeavors and to hasten the return of the Elohim;Angels or Fallen angels in Christianity and Jinn (Genies) in Islam.; to Earth.;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 104.;

In September 19, 1974, Claude Vorilhon held his first public conference Paris, France which attracted more than 2000 people.;[http://rael.org/rael_content/rael_bio.php?prophet Rael: Messenger of the Elohim], ''The International Raelian Movement''. Retrieved 1 December 2006.;Soon after, Rael founded and began to establish MADECH.;In December 13, this was brought into fruition as 170 MADECH members gathered at Puy de Lassolas and formed an organization of &quot;a president, a treasurer, and a secretary&quot; who each signed a 10,000 franc check payable towards the publication of the first Raëlian book.;Palmer, p. 37.;

Susan J. Palmer commented that in ''UFO platform societies'' like the MADECH organization, there was no obligation of membership and commitment like those found in cults, but rather an open place where people could freely exchange their views and relate their experiences on the subject of UFOs.Only the first Raëlian book had surfaced at the time, and Palmer says it had comprised largely of a &quot;creation myth and eschatology&quot; but it had &quot;no rituals, no priesthood, no experiential dimension, and no coherent system of ethics&quot; which would lead to an organized movement that had any chance of committing to large projects guided by a leader.;Palmer, p. 57.;

At the :fr:Place de la République|Place de la République in March 1975, Claude Vorhilon staged a purging of leaders which hampered his own creativity.;Palmer, p. 38.; In the following month, Claude Vorhilon called for a meeting of the MADECH organization, which held its headquarters in Paris, and as its president, he conducted it with the intention to rid the organization from the kind of occultism and pseudoscience which contradicted his physicalist point of view.;Palmer, p. 37.; In addition to this, the MADECH officials had an increasing desire to blend in with the rest of the ufologists and trekkies and were becoming less interested in the Raëlian view of Elohim extraterrestrials.A schism was becoming more apparent among the officials, and subsequently Vorilhon dismissed all of them.Their positions were replaced by an inner circle of seven people whose mission was to inform the public of the Raëlian messages and to raise funds for building an Raëlian embassy for extraterrestrials|embassy for extraterrestrials.;Palmer, p. 37.;Vorilhon says he resigned as president of MADECH by that June, because it seemed to him that MADECH could survive on its own and that he had made a mistake by structuring it into a form that he likened to a &quot;petanque club or a war veterans' association.&quot;Then he speaks of a personal desire to settle in the countryside and write an autobiography of events happening prior to his purported extraterrestrial encounters beginning in December 13, 1973.;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 142-143.;

=Sightings=
In his book ''Intelligent Design'', Raël claims the following events occurred.In July 31, 1975, along with his wife Marie-Paul and a devoted MADECH member, François, Raël sights a UFO near his new home in the countryside near Clermont-Ferrand,;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 142-143.; the town he previously had lived in.;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 135.;The glowing craft performed aerial start-and-go maneuvers along a zigzag path.Raël thought that this was a verification that the new location that he and his wife were now living in was the right place and time.;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 142-143.;

He said that in October 7, 1975, an hour before midnight,; after having a sudden urge to observe the night sky, he decided to go to Roc Plat, an uninhabited place between two brooks surround by a forest. According to him a spacecraft suddenly landed and shone a bright light behind a bush.He said he then met the same extraterrestrial from his first encounter in December 13, 1973. He said after a few words, he was taken up in that spacecraft with the Eloha and sent to a remote base relatively close to the solar system where he was given a resort-style relaxation treatment.;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 145-148.;

He said that on the morning of October 8, received a lecture from Yahweh Elohim about his current achievement towards the foundation of MADECH, the need for geniocracy, Buddhism, and about the ideas of God and Soul, and later traveled to the Planet of the Eternals.He said the planet orbited around a very large star and had a climate similar to the rain forests of Earth. He later claimed to have sat down with the Eloha and had a meal with the major prophets including Buddha, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed. He said that a guide showed him installations which houses machines for creating biological robots. He gave a picture of his mother to a machine which he claimed created similarly-appearing biological robot.He said that in the night, he received an introduction to bedroom his future home at the Planet of the Eternals and was presented young, mature female biological robots. He said that before reaching a climax, he wore a helmet which plays music controlled by his thoughts which the females danced to. Then the climax happens.;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 148-171.;

He said that on the morning of October 9, he took a scented bath and that soon after, Yahweh Elohim (an extraterrestrial) presented Claude Vorilhon to a machine which maximized his faculties. Yahweh Elohim then gave advice to him, the one who has become Claude Raël.Claude Raël then spent a few more hours and enjoyed what that world had to offer while he was there, including meeting with the past messengers of the Elohim.;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 171-178.;By midnight of October 10 (Julian Date 2442695),; 666 days after the first meeting with the Elohim and minutes after the last one, Claude Raël is back on Roc Plat.;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 178.;

He said that in the afternoon of October 7, 1976, at ''la Negrerie'' of France, fifty Raëlians witnessed cotton-like substances falling from the sky;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 356-7.; which Rael said has a historical relationship to manna.;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 28.; Rael said that manna was a pulverized synthetic chemical food made by the Elohim, and that it was sent to Israelites on the ground in similar manner during their journey through an artificial passage in Red Sea formed by a repulsion beam.;Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 28.;

=Geniocratic movement=
In 1978, Raëlians had a conference for the French press announcing their vision for a worldwide political movement for Geniocracy.In March 1978, one their members was voted onto the city council of Sarlat.However, in the previous December, the authoritarian nature of the Geniocratic model of government, the Raëlians being a sect, and the swastika in their logo prompted the police to seize documents in Raël's home as well as the homes of other Raëlians.;Palmer, p. 86.;

Middle years
=Claude Raël travels around the world=

From 1980 to 1992, the Raël and his movement became increasingly global. Beginning from 1980, Claude Raël's fifth Raelian book ''Sensual Meditation'' was published for the first time and formal publication of the Raelian Messages in the Japanese language began;[http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://webmarch.net/~jrm/ Harmony Revolution], ''Japanese Raelian Movement''.

Retrieved 3 February 2007.;

At sundown in 1986, in a restaurant next to Villa Pamphilli park—just outside Vatican City—Raël began claiming to members that he was the true pope and played a guitar hymn about extraterrestrials.;Palmer, p. 91.;In 1990, Australians became the next Raëlian target,;Palmer, p. 64.; and in 1992, Canada's Raëlians purchased 115 hectares near Valcourt, Quebec for a series of summer seminars in North America, and their leader gave it the name &quot;Le Jardin du Prophète&quot; (The Prophet's Gardens).;Palmer, p. 61.;

=First wave of sexual advocacy=
Quebec remained as the epicenter for Raelian campaigns and testing of experimental ideas.;Palmer, p. 64.; In December 1992, a project—Operation Condom—was launched in response to a veto of the Montreal Catholic School Commission against the installation of high school condom vending machines.A mobile condom vendor—a pink van dubbed the &quot;condom-mobile&quot;—was orchestrated by a Raëlian transexual.The transexual advocated the notion that extraterrestrial Elohim wanted the teens to live a long life of pleasure and criticized the commission by quoting statistics about teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.;Lewis, p. 375.;About 10,000 condoms were distributed.;Susan J. Palmer, [http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/csrpl/RINVol4No2/Rael.htm ''The Rael Deal''], ''Religion in the News'', Summer 2001, Vol. 4, No. 2.;

In Montreal July 7, 1993, a conference about masturbation entitled &quot;Yes to Self-Love&quot; was hosted by Betty Dodson, Raël, and a Raëlian bishop.;Palmer, p. 69.;Betty Dodson, who came to Montreal the previous month,;[http://raelianews.org/download.php?view.152 Clitoraid America], ''Raelian Contact 316''. 11 August 2006. Retrieved 30 September 2006.; spoke about her dream of a worldwide masturbation campaign for the 2000 New Year's celebration. Raël described his view on self-love, saying it is how people become linked to the cosmos, while Daniel Chabot—a local college psychology professor—spoke about the psychological benefits of masturbation.;Lewis, pp. 375.;;Palmer, p. 69.;Chabot's statements, along with his status with the sect and his purported use of his psychological credentials to attract new recruits led to some controversy with a corporation.The corporation won the suit but was ultimately charged by Chabot.;Lewis, pp. 375.;

=Raël's return to racing=
In 1994, rich Japanese Raëlians rented a race car and showed it to Claude Vorilhon.They believed that it would generate publicity for the movement.Claude accepted the offer on the condition that the funding must not come from member tithes or embassy funding.So the funding of Raël's races which took place in the 1990s and early 2000s came mostly from well funded European and Japanese people.;Susan J. Palmer|Palmer, Susan J.

=Calls for religious and tax-exempt status=
In October 7, 1994, Raëlians began implementing their own version of baptism in front of a baptismal font inside St. Peter's Basilica, however, in response to Catholics' complaints, Vatican guards escorted the Raëlians to the exit gates of the city.In the same week, Raël purportedly handed a copy of his book ''Le Livre qui dit la vérité'' to Pope John Paul II.;Palmer, p. 91.;

In March 1995, the Raëlians attained religious-corporation status in Quebec and was therefore eligible to apply for federal tax exemption in Canada.However the tax department refused the application since according to them, they did not meet the requirement of religions which believe in transcendental and immaterial beings.Raëlians made an appeal which did not go through.However, in the United States, the Raëlians' attempt to achieve tax-exempt status was a success.;Palmer, p. 66.;

Recent years
=Museum for the paranormal=
In August 1997, ''UFOland''—built by the Raëlians as the largest structure in North America made out of bales of hay—opened on their Valcourt estate.Its purpose was to inform the public about the Raëlian interpretation about the UFO phenomenon and to attract funds for the ''Raelian Foundation''. The first room served as an attraction for their proposed Raëlian embassy for extraterrestrials.Audio visual presentations in six other rooms displayed teachings about the Raëlian message, sightings, and government cover-ups concerning UFOs.In 2001, ''UFOland'' was closed to the public.The reason given by the director for ''UFOland'' was that the revenue did not justify the costs—including two hour trips from Montreal.;Palmer, p. 65.;

=Anti-clerical campaigns=
In July 2001, Raëlians on the streets attracted Italians and Swiss people as they gave leaflets in protest to over a hundred child molesters in existence among Roman Catholic clergy in France.They recommended that parents should not send their children to Catholic confession.The Episcopal vicar of Geneva sued the Raëlian Church for libel but did not win.;[http://www.kath.ch/infosekten/text_detail.php?nemeid=6390 The bishops react to the attacks anti-catholics of the Raëlian movement (translated)], ''Infosekten''. 22 May 2001.
