History
The Kingston Communications Stadium
The idea of a new stadium for Kingston upon Hull was first mooted in 1997, but funds to finance such a project only became available when the city council sold a portion of its holdings in Kingston Communications.; The council provided most of the funds, more than GB£42 million, with the rest stemming from government single regeneration budget grants and from the Football Stadium Improvement Fund.;

The council appointed John Topliss to head the stadium construction project.; He and his team partnered with consulting firm Drivers Jonas to explore preliminary issues such as stadium location, seating capacity, and facilities offered. Stated Mr. Topliss: &quot;We had a totally blank canvas and, working with consultants, made a thorough assessment of what was needed.&quot;;

The project team considered over a dozen sites, inside and outside of the city, before settling on The Circle in West Park.; Factors contributing to the decision include transport guidance, central government planning guidelines, existing athletic facilities, isolation from residential areas, and council ownership.;

The final recommendation of Drivers Jonas included additional facilities for both indoor and outdoor sports for the people of West Hull in addition to the main stadium, planned to seat from 25,000 to 30,000 spectators.; Professional services firm Arup Associates provided initial concept proposals for the stadium.; The Miller Partnership, an architectural and interior design firm, adopted these proposals during the stadium's design.;

Outline planning permission for the project was granted in December 2000, with Birse Construction Limited named as the main contractor the following year.;; 

In spite of a number of obstacles during the course of the project, including Hull City A.F.C.'s receivership in 2001 (just after the granting of planning permission),; the stadium complex was completed on time (in fourteen months); and on budget (at approximately GB£44 million).; The stadium opened its doors on December 18 2002. Hull City beat Sunderland A.F.C. 1&amp;ndash;0 in a friendly match to mark the occasion.;; Steve Melton scored the goal, the first at the KC Stadium.;;
