The suburb features many Victorian era houses, and some stately 19th century mansions, although not as grand as those on Fitzroy Terrace. The suburb is very appealing to those who want to live near the city, but not in such busy suburbs as North Adelaide and in the CBD.

The area is becoming increasingly popular, while still affordable. The average price for a 3 bed, 2 bath, house (as of Jan. 2006), with no extension, pool or tennis court is $575,000, however prices are increasing due to the suburb's growing popularity.Apartments in the suburb are rare.

The most expensive streets in Prospect include Clifton Street (Median sale price $745,000) and Carter Street (Median sale price $720,000). Houses in Barker Street also fetch high amounts, with one selling in 2006 for almost $2.15million.
