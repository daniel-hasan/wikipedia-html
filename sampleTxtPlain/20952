History


=Colonial=
The settlement of Mobile, then known as ''Fort Louis de la Louisiane'', was first established in 1702, at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff on the Mobile River, as the first capital of the French colony of Louisiana. It was founded by French Canadian brothers Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, in order to establish control over France's Louisiana claims with Bienville having been made governor of French Louisiana in 1701.Mobile’s Roman Catholic parish was established on 20 July 1703, by Jean-Baptiste de la Croix de Chevrières de Saint-Vallier, Bishop of Quebec.;Higginbotham, Jay. ''Old Mobile: Fort Louis de la Louisiane, 1702-1711'',pages 106-107. Museum of the City of Mobile, 1977. ISBN 0914334034.; The parish was the first established on the Gulf Coast of the United States.;The year 1704 saw the arrival of 23 women to the colony aboard the ''Pélican'', along with yellow fever introduced to the ship in Havana.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 20-21. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657;Though most of the &quot;''Pélican'' girls&quot; recovered, a large number of the existing colonists and the neighboring Native Americans died from the illness.; This early period also saw the arrival of the first African slaves aboard a French supply ship from Saint-Domingue. ; The population of the colony fluctuated over the next few years, growing to 279 persons by 1708 yet descending to 178 persons two years later due to disease.; 

Mobile and Fort Condé in 1725.
These additional outbreaks of disease and a series of floods caused Bienville to order the town relocated several miles downriver to its present location at the confluence of the Mobile River and Mobile Bay in 1711.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 17-27. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657;A new earth and palisade ''Fort Louis'' was constructed at the new site during this time.;&quot;Other Locations: Historic Fort Conde&quot; (history),Museum of Mobile, Mobile, Alabama, 2006, webpage:[http://www.museumofmobile.com/html/other_museums.php MoM-Other];By 1712, when Antoine Crozat took over administration of the colony by royal appointment, the colony boasted a population of 400 persons. In 1713 a new governor was appointed by Crozat, Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, founder of Detroit.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 30-32. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657;He did not last long due to allegations of mismanagement and a lack of growth in the colony, and he was recalled to France in 1716.Bienville again took the helm as governor, serving the office for less than a year until the new governor, Jean-Michel de Lepinay, arrived from France.; Lepinay, however, did not last long either due to Crozat's relinquishing control of the colony in 1717 and the shift in administration to John Law and his Company of the Indies.; Bienville found himself once again governor of Louisiana and in 1719 decided to move the capital elsewhere.;

The capital of Louisiana was moved to Biloxi in 1720,; leaving Mobile relegated to the role of military and trading outpost.In 1723 the construction of a new brick fort with a stone foundation began; and it was renamed Fort Condé in honor of Louis Henri, Duc de Bourbon and Princes of Condé|prince of Condé.;; Mobile would maintain the role of major trade center with the Native Americans throughout the French period, leading to the almost universal use of Mobilian Jargon as the simplified trade language with the Native Americans from present-day Florida to Texas.;

The expanded West Florida territory in 1767.
In 1763, the Treaty of Paris was signed, ending the French and Indian War. The treaty ceded Mobile and the surrounding territory to the Kingdom of Great Britain, and it was made a part of the expanded British West Florida colony.;; The British changed the name of Fort Condé to Fort Charlotte, after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, King George III's queen.;;The British were eager not to lose any useful inhabitants and promised religious tolerance to the French colonists, ultimately 112 French Mobilians remained in the colony.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 44-45. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657;In 1766 the population was estimated to be 860, though the town's borders were smaller than they had been during the French colonial efforts.;During the American Revolutionary War, West Florida and Mobile became a refuge for loyalists fleeing the other colonies.;Delaney, Caldwell. ''The Story of Mobile'', page 45. Mobile, Alabama: Gill Press, 1953. ISBN 0940882140;The Spanish captured the town in 1780 during the Battle of Fort Charlotte.The Spanish wished to eliminate any British threat to their Louisiana colony, which they had received from France in 1763s Treaty of Paris.;Their actions were also condoned by the revolting American colonies due to the fact that West Florida remained loyal to the British Crown.; The fort was renamed Fortaleza Carlota, with the Spanish holding Mobile and the surrounding Mobile District as a part of Spanish West Florida until 1810 when the Mobile District became part of the briefly independent Republic of West Florida.The Spanish continued to hold onto the town of Mobile itself until 1813, when the weakly defended port was seized by the U.S. General James Wilkinson during the War of 1812.;;

When Mobile was captured by the United States and made apart of the Mississippi Territory in 1813 the population had dwindled to roughly 300 people.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 65. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657; The city was included in the Alabama Territory in 1817, after Mississippi gained statehood. Alabama was granted statehood in 1819 and Mobile's population had increased to 809 by that time.; As the inland areas of Alabama and Mississippi were settled by farmers and the slave-based plantation economy became established, Mobile came to be settled by merchants, attorneys, mechanics, doctors and others seeking to capitalize on trade with these upriver areas.;With its location at the mouth of the Mobile River, a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi, Mobile was well situated for this purpose.By 1822 the population was 2800.;

From the 1830s onward Mobile expanded into a city of commerce with a primary focus on the cotton trade.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 69-71. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657;The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fire-proof brick warehouses.;The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the Black Belt and by 1840 Mobile was second only to New Orleans in cotton exports in the nation.;With the economy so focused on this one crop, Mobile's fortunes were always tied to those of cotton and the city weathered many financial crises during this period.;Though Mobile had a relatively small slave owning population itself compared to the inland areas, it was the slave-trading center of the state until surpassed by Montgomery in the 1850s.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 79-80. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657;By 1860 Mobile's population within the city limits had reached 29,258 people, it was the 27th largest city in the United States and 4th largest in what would soon be the Confederate States of America.;;The population in the whole of Mobile County, including the city, consisted of 29,754 free citizens, of which 1195 were African American.;; Additionally, there were 1785 slave owners, holding 11,376 slaves, for a total county population of 41,130 people.;

During the American Civil War, Mobile was a Confederate city.The first submarine to successfully sink an enemy ship, the ''H. L. Hunley'', was built in Mobile.;; One of the most famous naval engagements of the war was the Battle of Mobile Bay, resulting in the Union taking possession of Mobile Bay on 5 August 1864.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 113. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657;On 12 April 1865, 3 days after the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Courthouse, the city of Mobile surrendered to the Union army to avoid destruction following the Union victories at the Battle of Spanish Fort and the Battle of Fort Blakely.;Ironically, on 25 May 1865, the city suffered loss when some three hundred people died as a result of an explosion at a federal ammunition depot on Beauregard Street.The explosion left adeep hole at the depot's location, sunk ships docked on the Mobile River, and the resulting fires destroyed the northern portion of the city.;Delaney, Caldwell. ''The Story of Mobile'', pages 144-146. Mobile, Alabama: Gill Press, 1953. ISBN 0940882140 ;

Federal Reconstruction after the war saw the economy in near total ruin and widespread racial and class resentment develop.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'', pages 123-125. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657; Reconstruction in Mobile effectively ended in 1874 when the local Democrats gained control of the city government.;The last quarter of the 19th century was a time of economic depression and municipal insolvency for Mobile.One example can be provided by the value of Mobile's exports during this period of depression.The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3&amp;nbsp;million in 1882.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 145. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001.

The turn of the century brought the Progressive Era to Mobile and saw Mobile's economic structure evolve along with a significant increase in population.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 154-169. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657;The population increased from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920.;During this time the city received $3 million in federal grants for harbor improvements, which drastically deepened the shipping channels in the harbor.;During and after World War I manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile's economic health with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important.;During the Progressive Era social equality and race relations in Mobile worsened.;In 1902 the city government passed Mobile's first segregation ordinance, one that segregated the city streetcars.;Mobile's African American population responded to this with a two-month boycott which was ultimately unsuccessful.;After this, Mobile's de facto segregation would increasingly be replaced with legislated segregation.;

World War II led to a massive military effort causing a considerable increase in Mobile's population, largely due to the huge influx of workers coming into Mobile to work in the shipyards and at the Brookley Army Air Field.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 213-217. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657;Between 1940 and 1943, over 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries.;Mobile was one of eighteen U.S. cities producing Liberty ships at its Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company to support the war effort by producing ships faster than the Axis powers could sink them.;Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Corporation, focused on building freighters, Fletcher class destroyers, and minesweepers.;

The years after World War II brought about changes in Mobile's social structure and economy. Instead of shipbuilding being a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to take over and most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses.This periodsaw the end of racial segregation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Though many in Mobile had considered the city to be tolerant and racially accommodating compared to other cities in the South, with the police force and one local college becoming integrated in the 1950s and the voluntary desegregation of buses and lunchcounters by 1963, Caucasian Mobilians came to realize that Mobile's African American citizens were not nearly as content with the status quo as they had previously believed when in 1963 three African American students brought a case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High School.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 260-261. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657; The court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year.;

Some racial equality issues and hate crimes continued to occur in Mobile as late as the early 1990s.;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 271-275 Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657;The most notable instance was the 1981 random lynching of Michael Donald by Ku Klux Klan members on Herndon Avenue.;The perpetrators of the lynching were both convicted of murder with one receiving life in prison and the other being executed in 1997.This and the subsequent civil lawsuit filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center on behalf of Michael Donald's mother effectively put the Ku Klux Klan out of business in Alabama.;A fatal police shooting of an African American man in 1992 sparked violence and unrest in Mobile, leading to the formation of a Human Relations Commission by the city in 1994.;

Beginning in the late 1980s, the city council and former mayor, Mike Dow, began an effort termed the &quot;String of Pearls Initiative&quot; to make Mobile into a competitive, urban city.;;This effort would see the building of numerous new facilities and projects around the city and the restoration of hundreds of other historic downtown buildings and homes.;This period also saw a 50% reduction in the rate of violent crime and a concerted effort by city and county leaders to attract new business ventures to the area.;;The effort continues into the present with new city government leadership.;Shipbuilding began to make a major comeback in Mobile with the founding in 1999 of Austal USA, a joint venture of Australian shipbuilder, Austal, and Bender Shipbuilding.;;

Culture
Mobile is home to an array of cultural influences with its French, British, Spanish, African, Creole and Catholic heritage distinguishing it from all other cities in the state of Alabama.
