Michael Shawn Hickenbottom; (born July 22 1965),;; better known by his ring name Shawn Michaels, is an American professional wrestler. He performs on the ''Raw'' brand of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Currently, Hickenbottom is one of the senior performers in WWE, having joined in 1987. He is one of only two wrestlers (the other being The Undertaker) to have appeared on the very first episode of ''Monday Night Raw'' who are still with the company today.;Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.251); While continuing to make on-screen appearances, he was inactive from in-ring competition from 1998-2002 due to a legitimate severe back injury.;

Before coming to WWE, Hickenbottom began his career in Mid-South Wrestling in 1984. He then went on to Texas All-Star Wrestling. He made his national debut with the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1986. He signed with World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1987 while still under contract with the AWA. He returned to the AWA, only to go back to WWF in 1988.;

Hickenbottom is a four-time world champion: a three-time WWE Champion, and a one-time World Heavyweight Champion.;;;; He was also the winner of the 1995 and 1996 ''Royal Rumbles'';;;; and the first Grand Slam Champion.;; 

Career
=Early career=
Hickenbottom was born on July 22 1965 in Chandler, Arizona. The last of four children - Randy, Scott and Shari. He was raised in a military family and spent a brief part of his early years in Reading, Berkshire, England, but grew up in San Antonio, Texas. He knew he wanted to become a professional wrestler at the age of 12. Hickenbottom was already an athlete; his career began at the age of 6 when he started playing football. He was a stand-out Linebacker at Randolph High School;Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.30); and eventually became Captain of the football team.; After graduating, Hickenbottom attended Texas State University–San Marcos|Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, but soon realized that college life was not for him. Then he began pursuing the career of a professional wrestler. 

He was then trained by Mexican professional wrestler Jose Lothario and debuted in 1984 in Mid-South Wrestling and later with Texas All-Star Wrestling (TAW) promotion. During his time with TAW, Michaels and Paul Diamond were awarded the TAW Tag Team Championship by Chavo Guerrero, Sr.;;

Hickenbottom also worked for Central States Wrestling. There, he and tag team partner Marty Jannetty defeated The Batten Twins for the Central States Tag Team Championship, later losing it back to the Battens.;; Hickenbottom also made several appearances in the Dallas, Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling throughout 1985.

=American Wrestling Association (1986-1988)=
Michaels made his national-level debut in 1986 for the American Wrestling Association (AWA), once again teaming with Jannetty. The pair was billed as &quot;The Midnight Rockers&quot; and won the AWA World Tag Team Championship twice.;; They also appeared in the Mid-South on loan at this point. In a raid of AWA talent in 1987, The Rockers were signed by a competing promotion: the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). However, they were fired from the WWF two weeks later for &quot;partying too hard&quot; (a misunderstanding, according to Michaels' autobiography). They then returned to the AWA, but were re-signed by the WWF a year later.

=World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1988-1998, 2002-present)=
1988-1991

They redebuted for the World Wrestling Federation at a house show on July 7 1988.;Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.133); Due to WWF chairman Vince McMahon's desire to have his performers carry WWF-exclusive monikers, they were repackaged as simply &quot;The Rockers&quot;.

The team proved popular with both children and women, as well as 'List of professional wrestling slang#S|smart' fans who appreciated technical wrestling. The team was a mid-card stalwart of TV and pay-per-view (PPV) shows for the next two years, but never seemed to get a fair chance at the WWF's Tag Team Championships.

Belatedly, in October 1990, their chance came when The Rockers were scheduled to win the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Hart Foundation; Jim Neidhart, half of the championship team, was in the process of negotiating his release from the company.;; The match was taped with The Rockers List of professional wrestling slang#C|cleanly winning the belts, but soon after, Neidhart came to a stopgap agreement with management and was rehired.; The belts were returned to the Harts, while the title change was never broadcast or even acknowledged on TV. When news spread, WWF explained that the original result was void due to a collapsed turnbuckle in the ring during the bout. A buckle had indeed broken, but not to a noticeable or dangerous extent during the match. The Rockers plodded along, eventually splitting on December 2 1991 during an incident on Brutus &quot;The Barber&quot; Beefcake's televised &quot;Barber Shop&quot; talk show segment. Michaels superkicked Jannetty and threw him through a glass window on the &quot;shop&quot; set.;; Jannetty vanished from the WWF and Michaels List of professional wrestling slang#T|turned heel as &quot;The Boy Toy&quot;.

1992-1993
At the suggestion of Curt &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; Hennig, Michaels' ring name was changed to The Heartbreak Kid.;; Along with his new name came a new List of professional wrestling slang#G|gimmick as a vain, cocky heel. He was put together with mirror-carrying manager &quot;Sensational&quot; Sherri, who, according to the storyline, had become infatuated with him.;; Sherri even sang the first version of his new theme music &quot;Sexy Boy.&quot;; During that period, Michaels normally wrestled during the first half of house shows, and his departure was announced with the words &quot;Shawn Michaels has left the building&quot; (alluding to the phrase &quot;Elvis has left the building&quot;).;;

Michaels failed to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship from Bret Hart in July 1992, even losing the WWF's first ever Ladder match against him at a House show.;Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.161);;Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.162); Still, Michaels was beginning to List of professional wrestling slang#G|get over as a heel. He won the WWF Intercontinental Championship from &quot;The British Bulldog&quot; during ''Saturday Night's Main Event'' on October 27 1992.;; Shortly thereafter, he was in a PPV main event for the first time, facing — and losing to — future nemesis Bret Hart, for the WWF Championship at the 1992 Survivor Series.;; They were moved to the main event after The Ultimate Warrior suddenly departed from the WWF, leaving his tag-team match with Randy Savage against Ric Flair and Razor Ramon hanging. The new main event of &quot;Champion vs. Champion&quot; stole the show. 

Michaels and Sherri split at this point, and Jannetty quickly reappeared, leading to several memorable matches. Michaels went onto lose the Intercontinental Championship to Jannetty on ''Monday Night Raw'' on May 17 1993.;; He then regained it on June 6 1993 with the help of his debuting &quot;bodyguard&quot; (and off-air friend) Diesel.;

After a much-hyped but ultimately disappointing feud with Mr. Perfect, Michaels quit the WWF in September 1993. It was announced that Michaels had failed to defend his belt enough times during a set period; in reality, he had been suspended for testing positive for steroids — a charge that Michaels denies to this day. After turning down WCW's advances, Michaels returned to the WWF and made several appearances in the United States Wrestling Association during a WWF/USWA cross-promotion. He returned to WWF television for November's Survivor Series PPV, substituting for the arrested Jerry Lawler in a match pitting himself and three of Lawler's &quot;Knights&quot; against Bret, Bruce, Keith, and Owen Hart.;;

1994-1995
He soon entered a feud with Razor Ramon, who had won the vacated Intercontinental Title during Michaels' absence. Since Michaels had never been defeated in the ring for the title, he claimed to be the rightful champion and even carried around his old title belt. This feud culminated in a ladder match between the two at WrestleMania X. Michaels lost the match, which featured both his and Ramon's belts suspended above a ladder in the ring.;; This match won &quot;Match of the Year&quot; awards from ''Pro Wrestling Illustrated'';; and the ''Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter''. It also earned Michaels a reputation of being the &quot;Innovator of the Ladder Match&quot; when, in reality, it was Bret Hart who brought in the idea two years previously from his experience in Stampede Wrestling where the Ladder Match had been used since the 1970s.

Michaels battled various injuries over the next few months and soon launched the &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; TV talk show segment, mainly shown on ''WWF Superstars''.;Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.190);

On August 28 1994, Michaels and his ever more popular sidekick, Diesel, captured the WWF World Tag Team Championship from The Headshrinkers. During their brief time as a tag team, they used a variation of the Headshrinkers' finishing move, where Michaels finished off their opponent by climbing on Diesel's shoulders and professional wrestling aerial techniques#splash|splashed their opponents. The next day, at SummerSlam, Diesel lost the Intercontinental Title to Ramon when Michaels accidentally Superkicked his bodyguard.; This triggered a Michaels-Diesel split, a storyline that was drawn out until the Survivor Series that November due to Michaels' hand injury.;; Michaels went on to win the 1995 Royal Rumble, where he was the first Royal Rumble participant to win the match from the No.1 spot.;; This set up a championship grudge match at WrestleMania XI against Diesel. Michaels recruited Sid as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match,;; and was attacked (kayfabe) by Sid the following night. After this, Michaels took time off.

He returned to the ring as a 'babyface' in June 1995 and defeated Jeff Jarrett at July's In Your House#In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks|In Your House pay-per-view to win his third Intercontinental title.;; This led to a title defense against Razor Ramon at SummerSlam, in a Ladder Match, which Michaels won.;; Around this time, Michaels became the alleged leader of a backstage group known as The Clique. Others perceived the group to have sufficient clout with WWF owner Vince McMahon, becoming dominant wrestling figures in WWF for several years in the mid-1990s. Michaels disputes the perception, saying that McMahon pushed only deserving wrestlers.;;;Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.206);;Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.207);;Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.208); Michaels' fan base was later nicknamed &quot;The Kliq&quot; as an inside reference to the real &quot;Clique.&quot;;;

In October 1995, he was legitimately attacked by several men outside a bar in Syracuse, New York.; Shortly afterwards, at the In Your House#In Your House 4: Great White North|In Your House: Great White North PPV, Michaels forfeited the Intercontinental title to rival Dean Douglas because he was, according to the WWF, unable to compete. However, Douglas lost the title immediately to Clique member Razor Ramon.;; Douglas maintained that Michaels could have wrestled that night and simply did not want to List of professional wrestling slang#P|put him over.

The next month, during a match with Owen Hart on an episode of ''Raw'', Owen nailed Michaels with an Professional wrestling attacks#Enzuigiri|Enzuigiri kick to the back of Michaels' head. They continued to wrestle, but Michaels collapsed in the ring, supposedly because he had suffered a concussion in the Syracuse incident.;; The concussion was a work, skillfully kept from most fans at the time.;

After teasing a retirement, Michaels announced that he would be returning to the WWF at the 1996 Royal Rumble match, which he won for the second year in a row.;; Around this time, Jose Lothario, Michaels' original trainer, became his on-screen manager.

Michaels won his first WWF Championship at WrestleMania XII in March 1996, pinning Bret Hart in the 'sudden death' overtime of their a sixty minute Iron Man match, which had ended in a 0-0 tie.;; As WCW gained momentum due to the signings of Michaels' friends Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, Michaels soldiered on as champion for most of the year, notably overcoming Mankind,;; Vader,;; and The British Bulldog;; in pay-per-view battles. 

Michaels' title reign ended at the 1996 Survivor Series in November, where he lost to Sycho Sid, his former bodyguard, at Madison Square Garden in a face vs. face match. This match was notable for the New York fans cheering for Sid when he hit both Michaels and Jose Lothario with a television camera and cheering again when he won the match and championship.;; A flu-ridden Michaels recaptured the belt from Sid in January at the 1997 Royal Rumble in front of his hometown fans in San Antonio.;; 

On a special episode of ''Raw'', dubbed ''Thursday RAW Thursday'',;; Michaels vacated the WWF title;;; he explained to the fans that he was informed by doctors that a knee injury was bad enough that he had to retire. His speech was regarded as controversial, as Michaels was allegedly unwilling to lose to Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13 (since it was noted that he was going to have a rematch with Hart at WrestleMania). Michaels contemplated thoughts of retirement and stated that he &quot;had to find his smile again&quot;, which he had &quot;lost&quot; somewhere down the line.;

After knee surgery by Dr. James Andrews, Michaels returned a few months later, briefly teaming with Steve Austin to win the WWF Tag Team Titles.;; Michaels reveals in his autobiography, about his real-life feud with Bret Hart, claiming that Bret did interviews on live television claiming that he [Michaels] was faking his whole injury.;;;;

At SummerSlam 1997, Michaels officiated the WWF title match between WWF Champion The Undertaker and Bret Hart. The match ended in controversial fashion, with Michaels nailing Undertaker with a chair (unintentionally, as he was aiming for Bret after he spat in his face). Michaels was then forced to award the title to his nemesis, Bret Hart. At WWF One Night Only, held in Birmingham, England in September, Michaels defeated The British Bulldog to capture the WWF European Championship.;; The fans at the event were so appalled at the result of the match they almost rioted and booed Michaels out of the building to the extent that they littered the ring with rubbish.;; Michaels' striking of the Undertaker with a chair began a feud between the two men. In October, at WWE Bad Blood#1997|In Your House: Badd Blood, Michaels and Undertaker participated in the very first Hell in a Cell match, which saw Michaels falling off the side of thehigh structure through a table. Michaels won the match with the help of the Undertaker's brother Kane, who made his debut.;;

In the summer, Michaels joined forces with real-life friend, Hunter Hearst Helmsley and Hunter's then-girlfriend, Chyna to form the stable, D-Generation X (DX). The group engaged in rebellious behavior, such as using the DX slogan &quot;Suck it!&quot;, in addition to the D-Generation X#Crotch chop|crotch chop towards other wrestlers, and sometimes the fans. Moving away from the family-oriented product, this marked the beginning of the History of professional wrestling#Monday Night Wars .281990s.29|WWF Attitude Era. Michaels also began re-feuding with Bret Hart's reformed The Hart Foundation#The (New) Hart Foundation|Hart Foundation, which was now a pro-Canada stable. Michaels taunted The Hart Foundation and Canada by engaging in acts, such as blowing his nose with and humping the Canadian Flag. In his book, ''Heartbreak &amp; Triumph'', Michaels claims the flag desecration was Bret's idea.;;

Michaels' feud with the Hart Foundation culminated in a title shot at the 1997 Survivor Series against Bret Hart, in what is thought to be the most controversial match in wrestling history. Michaels came out of this match, dubbed by fans the &quot;Montreal Screwjob&quot;, as the WWF World Champion.;; Michaels thus became the only wrestler to hold both the World Championship and the European Championship at the same time. However, Triple H pinned him in December during a farcical match, making Hunter the European Champion.;;

1998-Injury
In 1998, Michaels received a back injury in the List of professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Casket match against The Undertaker at the Royal Rumble;;; Michaels took a back body drop to the outside of the ring and smashed his lower back on the casket, causing him to herniate two discs and crush one completely. This forced Michaels into retirement after List of professional wrestling slang#D|dropping the WWF Championship to Steve Austin at WrestleMania XIV.;; 

Michaels returned to the WWF on November 23 1998, but not as a wrestler; instead, he replaced Sgt. Slaughter as the List of authority figures in professional wrestling#Commissioners|WWF Commissioner, joining Vince McMahon's Corporation List of professional wrestling slang#S|stable as a heel.;;;; Throughout late 1998 and early 1999, Michaels made regular TV appearances, booking matches, throwing around his authority, and sometimes even deciding the outcome of matches.;;;;;;;; In early 1999, Michaels turned face and re-joined D-Generation X,;; but disappeared from WWF television for a few months, and by the time he had returned, DX had broken up.

Michaels made occasional appearances on WWF television as a face commissioner during the spring and summer of 1999.;;;;;;;;;; It appeared as that he would once again turn heel during the premiere episode of WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|''SmackDown!'' on August 26 1999 when, while serving as a special guest referee, he superkicked The Rock, allowing Triple H to retain the WWF Championship.;;;; However, after this referee appearance, Michaels was absent from WWF television until May 21 2000 when he returned as a face to officiate the Iron Man match between the Rock and Triple H.;; One month later, Michaels briefly reappeared to hand over the role of commissioner to Mick Foley and afterwards was absent from WWF television for nearly a year.;;

At the time being, knowing that his wrestling career was over, Michaels was inspired to train individuals who were interested in wrestling. He saw potential in using his name and opening The Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy, after his lawyer, Skip McCormick, suggested the idea. However, hardships and challenges made Michaels have enough of the academy.

2002-Return to ''RAW''
In 2002, Michaels returned to wrestling, and was brought into the nWo by Kevin Nash as a new member of the stable.;; After the nWo was disbanded, Triple H appeared to want to make amends with Michaels. This was solidified when Michaels beseeched Triple H to return to ''Raw''. Later on, they came down to the ring sporting their D-Generation X music and attire. When the pair was about to perform their trademark &quot;Suck It&quot; taunt, Triple H nailed Michaels with his finisher Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|The Pedigree.;; Continuing the angle, a week later, Triple H attacked Michaels from behind in a parking lot and put his head through a car window.;; In response, Michaels challenged Triple H to &quot;a fight&quot; (a non-sanctioned match) at SummerSlam 2002, which Triple H accepted. 

Michaels returned to the ring to wrestle the match against Triple H at SummerSlam, laying the foundation for a feud that lasted for years. This match was noted for Michaels' emotional in-ring return after more than four years on the shelf. Michaels won at SummerSlam but was attacked by Triple H with a sledgehammer after the match.;;

At Survivor Series 2002, Michaels won the World Heavyweight Championship from Triple H in the first-ever Elimination Chamber match, which also featured Rob Van Dam, Kane, Chris Jericho, and Booker T. Michaels eliminated both Jericho and Triple H to win the match.;; This title win also marked the first time in WWE history that a wrestler won a World Championship in any type of List of professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match.

On the December 26 2005 edition of ''Raw'', Vince McMahon lauded Michaels for his part in the Montreal Screwjob. Michaels said he was only being loyal to his company, but said he had moved on and McMahon should move on as well.

During the 2006 Royal Rumble, to which Michaels entered twenty fifth, he eliminated MNM and Shelton Benjamin in succession to make it into the final six. At that point, Mr. McMahon’s music hit, and the Chairman made his entrance.

At Cyber Sunday, DX took on Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton).

Entrance music
*The song ''Sexy Boy'' was originally written for Michaels by Jimmy Hart. Hart thanked Michaels personally for continuing to use the song as his entrance music when he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005. Michaels' entrance music was originally performed by Sherri Martel until she became a babyface,; and then the second version was performed by Michaels himself with traces of Sherri in the chorus portion of the song. The current version of the song in use today is the version Michaels sung himself.
*Since the return of D-Generation X|DX, Michaels mostly used the DX entrance ''Break It Down,'' by The Chris Warren Band, even when wrestling in singles competition, but then went back to using ''Sexy Boy''.

Personal life
Growing up, Hickenbottom was never called &quot;Michael&quot; because he hated the name, so his family and friends just called him &quot;Shawn&quot;. Ever since, he has been referred to as Shawn. Additionally, Hickenbottom moved around frequently since his father was in the military. He relates in his autobiography how he dreaded the first day at his many new schools, when the teacher would call roll and announce his surname of &quot;Hickenbottom&quot; to the class, which would evoke giggles and teasing because of its unusual sound.;Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.18);

In 1996, Hickenbottom posed in a non-nude layout for ''Playgirl'' magazine. It was not until after he posed that he discovered that ''Playgirl'' has a mostly homosexual readership, which was seen as humorous by his fellow wrestlers.;Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.233);

Hickenbottom's marriage to his first wife, Theresa, was brief and ended in divorce, but was amicably settled.;Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.194); He is now married to former WCW Nitro Girl, Whisper (Rebecca Curci). They were married on March 31 1999 at the Graceland Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada.;Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.296); It was a very small wedding ceremony. The only people present were Hickenbottom, Rebecca Curci, and an Elvis impersonator. Hickenbottom and Curci have a son, Cameron Kade (born on January 5 2000);Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.304); and a daughter, Cheyenne Michelle (born on August 19 2004);Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.329);

Hickenbottom has several tattoos. He has a tattoo of a heart with a sword through it with what appears to be a snake around it in the shape of an &quot;S&quot;.;; He has one on his wedding finger, that has an ''R'' for his wife Rebecca. Another in his left wrist, it's a bracelet design that says &quot;Cameron&quot; for his son.;; On his left leg he has a picture of his wife,;; the other leg has a picture of the state of Texas.; Finally, he has a small broken heart with the letters &quot;HBK&quot; above it, tattooed on his right hip.;;

Hickenbottom is cross-dominance|ambidextrous.;Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story; This caused him problems as a boy playing football, as he had trouble differentiating between his right and left directions. He uses his right hand to draw and color and his left hand to write. He typically uses his right leg to deliver Sweet Chin Music.

Hickenbottom is a born again Christian. He was raised as a Roman Catholic, but became a non-denominational Christian under the influence of his wife Rebecca. His ring attire often incorporates cross symbols, and while on the way to the ring, he normally gets down on his knees and mouths a prayer while his pyrotechnics go off. He has been seen in the congregation during a televised service of Cornerstone Church in his hometown of San Antonio. Hickenbottom is a Bible teacher in his church of Cornerstone.; Hickenbottom also appeared on a Trinity Broadcasting Network program along with Sting.;;;;;;

Hickenbottom is a fan of the San Antonio Spurs NBA team. He was also a sportscaster for San Antonio local news for a short time during his retirement from wrestling. He has been seen wearing Spurs merchandise and attending Spurs games. JBL made a reference to Hickenbottom being a season ticket holder during the ''2007 Royal Rumble''.;;
