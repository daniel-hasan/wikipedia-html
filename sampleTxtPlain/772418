''Return of Saturn'' is the fourth album by American third wave ska band No Doubt, released by Interscope Records in April 2000 (see 2000 in music).After touring for two and a half years to promote its breakthrough album ''Tragic Kingdom'', No Doubt wrote several dozen songs for its follow-up and eventually settled on working with producer Glen Ballard.Creating the album became a tumultuous process lasting two years, during which there was dissension amongst band members and between the band and its label.The album was completed after the band returned to the studio and recorded what became two of the album's singles.

The album maintains the New Wave, ska and reggae themes of the band's previous work.It is influenced by alternative rock and mixes several other styles such as funk, cabaret, and hip hop music.The lyrics describe singer Gwen Stefani's pining for a more domestic life, contrasting that with her commitment to a music career.

Upon release, ''Return of Saturn'' received mixed reviews from music critics.It debuted at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200 but was unable to measure up to the sales of ''Tragic Kingdom''.The album produced four singles, only one of which charted on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.At the 43rd Grammy Awards, ''Return of Saturn'' album was nominated for Best Rock Album.

Composition







The music of ''Return of Saturn'' further explores the No Doubt's New Wave influences, while adding an alternative rock feel and maintaining some of the band's ska and reggae sounds.Adrian Young's drum part on &quot;Simple Kind of Life&quot; was mixed through low fidelity filters to give it the sound of a lo-fi music|lo-fi power ballad.;Montoya, Paris and Lanham, Tom.''The Singles: 1992-2003'' (liner notes).Interscope Records.November 25, 2003.;&quot;Marry Me&quot; is a reggae-influenced song featuring a staccato bassline and a horn part.;[http://www.channel4.com/music/music-core/album.jsp?albumId=369082 &quot;Return Of Saturn&quot;].Channel 4.Retrieved August 21, 2007.Inactive as of October 12, 2007.;&quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and &quot;Staring Problem&quot; were described as a more self-aware return to the band's earlier material, a combination of work by New Wave band Missing Persons and hard rock band Van Halen.;Walters, Barry.[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nodoubt/albums/album/229542/review/5944400/return_of_satur &quot;No Doubt: Return of Saturn : Music Reviews&quot;].''Rolling Stone''.April 27, 2000.Retrieved April 6, 2007.;

The album's lyrics depict Stefani's maturation and femininity, reflected by images of oral contraceptives, a wedding cake and makeup on the album cover, as well as her romantic relationship with Rossdale.Her lyrics drew comparisons to the bitter, confessional styling of Hole frontwoman Courtney Love.;;[http://www.nme.com/reviews/2119.htm &quot;Return Of Saturn&quot;].''NME''.Retrieved August 22, 2007.;&quot;New&quot; was written while the band was touring about the excitement of meeting Rossdale and her infatuation with him.;Later compositions, however, discuss the problems that the two had maintaining a long-distance relationship.&quot;Ex-Girlfriend&quot; discusses a failing relationship and, in &quot;Suspension Without Suspense&quot; and &quot;Home Now&quot; detail feelings of resentment, loneliness, and indecision.;On &quot;Simple Kind of Life&quot;, she confesses to hoping for a mistake with her birth control and a desire to leaving music for a domestic life.;She contrasts this, however, with her need for independence:


Reception
The album received mixed reviews from music critics.''Entertainment Weekly'' characterized the album as filled with &quot;smoother, layered mid-tempo ballads as creamily textured as extra-thick mille-feuille|napoleon pastries&quot; but stated that Stefani's lyrics were too much of a throwback to the alternative rock scene of the early 1990s and contrasted with the boom of teen pop.;Browne, David.[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,64630,00.html &quot;Return of Saturn | Music Review&quot;].''Entertainment Weekly''.April 10, 2000.Retrieved September 4, 2007.;Robert Christgau, writing for ''The Village Voice'', described the emotions Stefani expressed as shallow,;Christgau, Robert.[http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=No+Doubt &quot;Where the Action Isn't&quot;].''The Village Voice''.November 2000.Retrieved September 4, 2007.; and the ''NME'' stated that her preoccupation with Rossdale was distracting and weakened the intense, Madonna-like character she had established on ''Tragic Kingdom''.;[http://www.nme.com/reviews/2119.htm &quot;Return Of Saturn | Reviews&quot;].''NME''.Retrieved September 4, 2007.;All Music Guide, however, gave it four and a half stars, calling it &quot;a terrific, layered record that exceeds any expectations set by ''Tragic Kingdom''&quot;.;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:5tf6zf01ehak~T1 &quot;Return of Saturn >; Review&quot;].All Music Guide.Retrieved April 6, 2000.;Barry Walters of ''Rolling Stone'' referred to it as &quot;a superstar follow-up that not only betters its predecessor but also radically departs from it.&quot;;''Slant Magazine'' commented that although the album did not have any successful singles, ''Return of Saturn'' was &quot;a solid album and proof of a healthy, genre-breaking future for No Doubt.&quot;;Cinquemani, Sal.[http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=145 &quot;Music Review: No Doubt: Return Of Saturn&quot;].''Slant Magazine''.2002.Retrieved October 7, 2007.;
