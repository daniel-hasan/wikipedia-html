Balboa High School, colloquially known as Bal, is an American public high school located near the Excelsior District in the Mission Terrace neighborhood of San Francisco, California.;
 
;
Balboa serves grades nine through twelve as part of the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD).

Balboa is a comprehensive school located in an urban working class district.It historically educates a greater proportion of the city's disadvantaged and minority students relative to other city high schools.Mirroring conditions in the areas it serves, the school has a history marked by periods of violence, controversy, and low academic performance. 

The school motto is &quot;First on the Pacific&quot;.The campus is the first and only historic landmark school in the district and the only one operating in the city.Following the dismissal of the entire Faculty (university)#North American usage|faculty, in 1999, it became the first school in Northern California to embrace and convert its curriculum to the concept of small learning communities. It was the first in California to start a school-based student health clinic.In response to the AIDS pandemic, it was the first school in California to distribute free condoms to students.In the last decade, Balboa has experienced a turnaround and has improved its reputation and academic performance.;

History
Balboa High School, main classroom building|302px
Balboa High School is named after 16th century Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa. Founded in 1928, campus construction was completed in 1931.

In the spring of 1952, students at Balboa invented a variation on a conga line dance which inspired bandleader and songwriter Ray Anthony to compose an accompanying hit song with the same name, &quot;The Bunny Hop&quot;.;
 
;

In 1986, Balboa converted its metal shop into the first school-based health clinic in California: the Balboa Teen Health Center. The clinic provides basic medical and mental health services. The clinic has improved access and the health habits of a disadvantaged student population that might otherwise have gone without professional health assistance.;
 
;
In an effort to prevent the spread of AIDS, Balboa became the first school in California to distribute free condoms to students in May 1992.;
 
;
This program and the clinic's other family planning and sexually transmitted disease efforts have featured somewhat controversially in a number of research papers and debates.;
 
;;
 
;;
 
;

Balboa became embroiled in controversy over a hazing incident on February 22, 1994 in which three JROTC cadets were assaulted by other team members under orders from senior commanders. Ultimately one cadet was rendered partially deaf from a punctured eardrum.;
 
;
The resulting litigation from this incident exposed a culture and history of JROTC hazing at Balboa and several other SFUSD schools extending into the 1980s.;
 
;
This Jrotc#Controversy|controversy has been cited by JROTC opponents in efforts to eliminate the program at all SFUSD schools.;
 
;

=Academic resurgence=
In 1996, frustrated by high turnover and low performance on the part of the educational staff, the SFUSD dismissed the entire faculty in a desperate move to turn the school around.;
 
;

During the 1999-2000 academic year, Balboa shifted its entire academic program to the concept of Small Learning Communities (SLC). These communities would form a &quot;school-within-a-school&quot; in an effort to turn around past poor academic performance. To support the formation of SLCs, Balboa was the recipient of funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in 2004 and 2005 through the [http://www.ecclf.org Every Child Can Learn Foundation] Secondary Redesign Initiative.;

Frustrated by poor conditions such as insufficient textbooks and dilapidated facilities during the late 1990s, students at Balboa became members of the class-action lawsuit ''Williams v. California''.;
 
;
Filed in 2000 by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against the State of California, the suit alleged a failure to provide adequate facilities, textbooks, and teachers for the poorest schools in the state.;
 
;;
The case was named after Eliezer Williams, a middle school student age 12 at the time, who would go on to graduate from Balboa.;
 
;
The lawsuit was resolved in 2004, with the administration of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger agreeing to provide US$138 million for instructional material, US$50 million for critical facility repairs at nearly 2,400 state schools, and to reimburse school districts for future repairs of deficient facilities. Estimates indicate California may be liable for up to US$1 billion in reimbursements over several years.;
 
;

Building on an effort started in 2001 to increase scores by providing breakfast before tests, Balboa initiated a pilot program in 2005 called &quot;Grab N Go&quot;.;
 
;
A first for Northern California, the program has increased the number of disadvantaged students receiving breakfast. Using magnetic swipe cards, eligible students can pick up a pre-bagged meal as they enter the building and can eat the meal during the first ten minutes of their first class.;
 
; 
Previously, students would have to arrive up to 30 minutes before classes started and finish the meal in the cafeteria. Prior to 2001 participation in the free or reduced-fee meal program averaged under 40% of eligible enrollment.Since the pilot program started, breakfast participation has averaged over 55%.;Credited with increasing academic performance, the program was nominated by Nancy Pelosi for and subsequently received a Victory Against Hunger Award from the [http://hungercenter.org Congressional Hunger Center] in 2006.;
 
;
Balboa was one of four schools nationwide to receive part of a grant from the [http://www.gotbreakfast.org got breakfast?] campaign in March 2007 to support the program.;

Campus
Aerial image of the entire Balboa High School campus|200px
=Location=
The school campus is located a few blocks away from major thoroughfares including Mission Street.The campus is close to Balboa Park, Balboa Park Station, and Interstate 280.San Francisco Municipal Railway transit lines J, K, M, 9X, 14, 14L, 14X, 26, 29, 43, 49, and 54 provide nearby service.

The Balboa campus is part of a larger SFUSD academic complex that includes neighboring James Denman Middle School and the San Miguel Child Development Center.Balboa is close to City College of San Francisco, the private Lick-Wilmerding High School, and Catholic Archbishop Riordan High School. Sited at the bottom of a valley, parts of the campus are built over a former river and lake.;
 ;

=Landmark=
Balboa is the only historic landmark school currently operating in San Francisco.The campus became city historic landmark number 205 by proclamation signed on January 20, 1995 by mayor Frank Jordan.;
 
;
Balboa is regarded as one of the better architected and visually engaging schools within the SFUSD.;
 
;
San Francisco architect John Reid Jr. designed the first campus buildings in the Spanish Colonial Revival Style with a prominent center courtyard, mission style roof tiles, and arcades.

Although originally designed with a distinctive red mission tile roof, all campus buildings had their roofs replaced in 1998 with seismically stable materials.An original roof tile is housed in Balboa's Hall of History.;
 
;

=Facilities=
The main entrance along the eastern side of the campus quadrangle is dominated by the three-story main classroom building.The library building to the north of the quad equals the height of the main building.Distinct bridges on all three levels connect these two buildings. Vocational and cafeteria facilities form the eastern side of the campus quad.

Arts and athletic facilities dominate the southern half of the campus.Facilities along this side of the quad include the gymnasium, tennis courts, track, and football field.Balboa's auditorium, theater, and music rooms are also on the southern side of the campus quad. In 2004, the theater was refurbished with the help of charitable funding from theatrical producer Carole Shorenstein Hays.;
 
;

In partnership with PG&amp;E, Balboa will be one of seven SFUSD schools to participate in the district's &quot;Solar Schools&quot; program. Solar panels will be installed on the roof to benefit from and raise awareness of alternative energy.;
 
;

Demographics
Gymnasium arcade|135px
Balboa historically has a school population of primarily ethnic minorities. Since 1993, the White population at Balboa has consistently totaled less than 7% of yearly enrollment. Up to 2003, the predominant ethnic groups at the school alternated between Hispanic (24-30%) and African American (19-24%). During this time Filipino students also figured prominently in the ethnic distribution (19-30%) briefly becoming the majority ethnic group between 1997 and 1999. American Indians have always comprised less than 1%, and Pacific Islanders less than 3% of the school population.;

Starting in 2004, the school's increasing academic stature combined with citywide demographic changes attributable to gentrification radically changed the student demographic at Balboa.;
 
;;
 
;
Asian students became the predominant ethnic group (34-39%) previously accounting for less than 20% of the school population. Hispanic and Filipino students followed with declining majorities. The largest decline was in the number of African American students, accounting for only 11.4% of the school population through the 2006-2007 school year.;;

Coinciding with the academic turmoil of the late 1990s, the dropout rate at Balboa experienced a spike of over 230 students (16.8%) leaving in 1998. The year 2000 saw a sharp decline in the dropout rate, with no students leaving that year. The rate has averaged 2-6% since then.;

The demographic composition of certificated Faculty (university)#North American usage|faculty over the last decade has consisted primarily of White teachers (32-54%) with approximately similar distributions of staff reporting Asian (6-15%), Filipino (9-19%), or Hispanic (11-19%) ethnicity.African American staff accounted for the remaining 8-11%.The number of staff over the last decade has averaged between 55 and 91 members.;

Curriculum
Library building entrance|160px
;
Balboa participates in the SFUSD's admissions lottery in which students from the entire city can indicate a preference to attend any of the district schools regardless of geographical location. Based on this preference and certain socioeconomic factors, students are then assigned to schools per district policies and goals.

=Small learning communities=
Academic instruction at Balboa High School is centered on the concept of SLCs. Each community has a thematic focus that encourages individualized learning, an awareness of the future, and personal responsibility.;
 
;
Teachers and students work in a shared thematic collaboration to integrate lessons from their classes. The same sets of students are present in each of the classes, fostering the learning community. Some teachers will follow their students into successive grade levels to enhance continuity.;
 
;

In their first two years, communities of approximately 60-120 students experience focused core literary and mathematics instruction, with emphasis on community citizenship, and an exploration of career paths. Academies or pathways are chosen by students at the end of the 10th grade for the second half of their school career with the goal of preparation for career and college. A few exceptions are noted below.

Every community or academy has several goals in common. Students are educated in preparation for their future career or post-secondary education.All communities provide the University of California &quot;A-G college prep&quot; coursework necessary for university admissions eligibility.;
 
; All 11th and 12th grade academies have a common goal of combining coursework with external experiences through field trips, internships, or a mentorship with local business entities or the community at large.These external events are used to raise career awareness.Students in all communities will develop a personal portfolio or résumé.
