The 1918 Swan by-election was a by-election for the Division of Swan in the Australian House of Representatives, following the death of the sitting member Sir John Forrest. Held on 26 October 1918, the by-election not only led to the election of the youngest person ever to be elected to the Parliament of Australia, Edwin Corboy, but saw the conservative vote split by the Country Party and the Nationalist Party, directly prompting the introduction of instant-runoff voting in Australia.

Background

Sir John Forrest, who had been the first Premier of Western Australia, was elected to the Australian House of Representatives for the Division of Swan at the first federal election on 29 March 1901.

On 6 February 1918, Forrest was offered a place in the British peerage (he was to be created Baron Forrest of Bunbury), though the relevant letters patent had not at the time been issued. Forrest set out for England to accept the offer and take up his place in the House of Lords, but he died en route on 2 September 1918, off the coast of Sierra Leone, from cancer. Thus, a by-election was called to replace Forrest as the representative for Swan.

=Electoral system and political parties in Australia=

By 1909, Australia had a stable two-party system at the federal level, with the conservative Commonwealth Liberal Party and the progressive Australian Labor Party alternating terms in power. This system was upset in November 1916, when the Labor party split over the issue of conscription; then Prime Minister Billy Hughes and his pro-conscription supporters leaving the Labor party and forming a minority government as the &quot;National Labor Party&quot;, before merging with the Liberals in February 1917 to form the Nationalist Party of Australia with Hughes as their leader.;;

However, Hughes was distrusted by some on the conservative side of politics for his past involvement in socialist politics as Labor leader, and disaffected conservative farmers were moved to support the new Country Party, now known as the National Party of Australia, which had been formed in Western Australia in 1913 (and would be formed federally in 1922 from an amalgamation of state-based parties).;

At the time of the 1918 Swan by-election, Australia used a &quot;first past the post&quot; voting system, as was used in the United Kingdom, in all elections at the federal level.; Under this system, the winner was simply the candidate with the greatest number of votes.

Election

Candidates from both the conservative parties contested the election — William Hedges from the Nationalist Party and Basil Murray from the Country Party — against Edwin Corboy from Labor and independent candidate William Watson. Hedges was previously a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Fremantle, from 1906 to 1913.;;

=Results=

In the end, the Nationalist and Country candidates split the conservative vote, Hedges achieving 29.6% and Murray gathering 31.4% of the total; however, both were beaten by the Labor candidate Corboy, who received 34.4% of the total vote.;; Corboy was duly elected as the member for Swan.










Consequences

Corboy, who at the time of the by-election was just twenty-two years and two months old, remains the youngest person ever to be elected to either house of the Parliament of Australia.;;;;

Shocked by the loss of a previously safe Nationalist seat to Labor, the Nationalist government was moved to initiate electoral reform and replace the first past the post system with instant-runoff voting (typically referred to as preferential voting in Australia), as part of a rewrite of the electoral legislation with the ''Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918''.;; While preferential voting had already been introduced at the state level in Western Australia (1907) and Victoria (1911), and had been considered at the federal level by Sir Joseph Cook's government (1913-1914), it was only these &quot;considerations of partisan advantage [and not] the finer points of electoral theory&quot; which provided the impetus for the change.;;

Preferential voting was first put to use in the Corangamite by-election, 1918|Corangamite by-election for the Victorian seat of Corangamite two months later, where Labor candidate and future Prime Minister James Scullin topped the primary vote, only to be defeated after distribution of preferences by William Gibson of the Victorian Farmers Union.; The preferential voting system remains in place to this day, and has helped to support a fairly stable three-party system, albeit with the non-Labor parties (presently the Liberal Party of Australia and the since-renamed National Party) regularly forming coalition governments.;

At the 1919 election, Corboy once again polled the highest percentage of the primary vote, with two conservative candidates again splitting the conservative vote; yet with the introduction of preferential voting, Corboy was easily defeated by John Prowse of the Farmers' and Settlers' Association on preferences.;;

In a twist of fate William Watson, who finished a distant fourth in this by-election with just 4.6% of the vote, was successfully elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Fremantle at the 1922 election on the back of preferences from Nationalist candidate William Hedges, the same man who had also contested this by-election, and who had previously been the member for Fremantle.;;
