The ''Audacious'' class aircraft carriers were a class of ship proposed by the British government in the 1930s - 1940s. The ''Audacious'' class was originally designed as an expansion of the ''Implacable'' class with double storied hangars. However, it was realised that the hangar height would not be sufficient for the new aircraft that were expected to enter service, so the design was considerably enlarged.
 
Four ships of were laid down between 1942 and 1943 during World War II as part of the British naval buildup - HMS ''Africa'' (D06), HMS ''Ark Royal'' (91), HMS ''Audacious'' (D29) and HMS ''Eagle'' (94). At the end of hostilities ''Africa'' and ''Eagle''were cancelled. Work on the remaining two was suspended.

As the builds of ''Eagle'' and ''Ark Royal'' progressed they differed so much that they became the lead (and sole) ships of each of their own classes. They formed the backbone of the postwar carrier fleet, and were much modified.
