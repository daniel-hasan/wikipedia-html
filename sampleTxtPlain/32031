The University of Texas at Austin (often referred to as The University of Texas, UT Austin, UT, or Texas) is a doctoral/research university located in Austin, Texas. It is the flagship#University campuses|flagship;;;;;;;;;; institution of The University of Texas System. The main campus is located less than a mile from the Texas State Capitol in Austin. According to ''The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities'' (2001) by Howard and Matthew Greene, The University of Texas at Austin is one of America's &quot;Public Ivy&quot; institutions of higher education, defined by the authors as a public institution that &quot;provides an Ivy League collegiate experience at a public school price.&quot; Founded in 1883, the university has had the fifth largest single-campus enrollment in the nation as of fall 2006 (and had the largest enrollment in the country from 1997&amp;ndash;2003), with nearly 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and 16,500 faculty and staff.; It currently holds the largest enrollment of all colleges in the state of Texas. 

The university also operates various auxiliary facilities aside from the main campus, most notably the J. J. Pickle Research Campus. Texas is a major center for academic research, annually exceeding $380 million in funding. In addition, the university's athletic programs were recognized by ''Sports Illustrated,'' which dubbed UT &quot;America's Best Sports College&quot; in 2002.

History


The first mention of a public university in Texas can be traced to the 1827 constitution for the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas. Although an article promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, no action was ever taken by the Mexican government. After Texas obtained its independence from Mexico in 1836, the Congress of Texas adopted the Constitution of the Republic, which included a provision to establish public education in republic, including two universities or colleges. On January 26, 1839, Congress agreed to eventually set aside fifty leagues of land towards the effort; in addition, forty acres in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated &quot;College Hill.&quot;
The University's old Main Building in 1903.
In 1846, Texas was annexed into the United States. The state legislature passed the Act of 1858, which set aside $100,000 in United States bonds towards construction. In addition, the legislature designated land, previously reserved for the encouragement of railroad construction, toward the universities' fifty leagues. However, Texas's secession from the Union and the American Civil War prevented further action on these plans.

The passing of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act in 1862 facilitated the creation of Texas A&amp;M University, which was established in 1876 as the Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College of Texas.;[http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/TT/kct8.html Texas A&amp;M University] ''Handbook of Texas Online.'' Accessed 29 July 2006.; The Texas Constitution of 1876 mandated that the state establish a university &quot;at an early day,&quot; calling for the creation of a &quot;university of the first class,&quot; The University of Texas. It revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858 but appropriated one million acres (4000 km²) in West Texas. In 1883, another two million were granted, with income from the sale of land and grazing rights going to The University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M. 
At , the University of Texas Tower was designed by Paul Philippe Cret in 1931.;[http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/99newsreleases/nr_199909/nr_tower990909.html UT Austin Tower information guide];

In 1881, Austin was chosen as the site of the main university, and Galveston was designated the location of the medical department. On the original &quot;College Hill,&quot; an official ceremony began construction on what is now referred to as the old Main Building in late 1882. The university opened its doors on September 15, 1883.

The old Victorian-Gothic Main Building served as the central point of the campus's forty acre site, and was used for nearly all purposes. However, by the 1930s, discussions rose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.

Constitutional restrictions against funding building construction hampered expansion. However, the funds generated by oil discovered on university-owned grounds in 1923 were put towards its general endowment fund. This extra revenue allowed the university to pay down its debt, and pass bond in 1931 and 1947, funding the necessary expansion after the enrollment spike following World War II. The university built 19 permanent structures between 1950 and 1965, when it was given the right of eminent domain. With this power, the university purchased additional properties surrounding the original forty acres.

On August 1 1966, Charles Whitman, a former U.S. marine and architectural engineering major at the university, barricaded himself on the observation deck of the tower of the Main Building with a Remington 700 6 mm rifle and various other weapons. In the ensuing 96-minute stand-off, Whitman killed 14 people and wounded an additional 31 before himself being killed by police who stormed the observation tower.;; Later, the observation deck was closed until 1968 and closed again in 1975 following a series of suicide jumps. During the time of the shooting, the tower was open to the public. However, in 1998, after the installation of security and safety measures, the observation deck reopened to the public available by weekend tours.;[http://www.utexas.edu/student/txunion/ae/towertours/?tours=schedule Tower Tours Schedule Fall 2005] ''The Texas Union.''

=Admission=

As a state public university, UT is subject to Texas House Bill 588 (HB 588, popularly known as the top ten percent law). HB 588 states that a Texas resident graduating in the top 10% of their senior class from an accredited Texas high school will be guaranteed ''admission'' when they submit a complete application by the deadline.However, HB 588 guarantees admission into the university only; it does not guarantee acceptance into a particular major, nor does it guarantee any scholarship or other form of tuition assistance (except for those who are class valedictorian; a pre-existing law guarantees these students a full 'tuition only' scholarship for their first year of college).

Students outside of top ten percent will be reviewed holistically and compete for admission. Things that are not taken into consideration are the high school they attend and the level (AP courses, honors) of the curriculum they are taking.;http://bealonghorn.utexas.edu/freshmen/admission/factors/academic/index.html;

Their selectivity is deemed as &quot;More selective&quot; according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching;;. In fall 2006, a total of 27,315 applications were received and 13,305 were admitted. In fall 2007, 27,232 applications and 13,781 students were admitted.;;

=Faculty and research=
As of 2004, the university employed 2,271 faculty members. Approximately 51.1% were tenured, while an additional 17.8% were tenure track. The university's faculty includes winners of the Nobel Prize, the Pulitzer Prize, the National Medal of Science, the National Medal of Technology, and numerous other awards. Over 1,000 faculty positions are endowed by private funds. Since 1984, more than forty $1 million-endowed chairs have been created at The University of Texas to recruit distinguished faculty and facilitate research in the sciences and engineering.

The university exceeds $446 million in annual research funding;http://www.utsystem.edu/news/fastfacts.html;, and its facilities house more than 90 research units. UT has earned more than 400 patents since its founding. In 2005, Texas secured $417 million in awards and grants, a new university record. In addition, Texas earned $5 million in licensing revenue and capped a six-year funding increase of 48%. The university has also reached out to establish partnerships with other facilities, including The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, The University of Texas Health Science Center, the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center of NASA, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and the International Center for Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials.;[http://www.utexas.edu/research/about/2005report/ Report on Research 2005] ''The University of Texas Office of the VP for Research.''

=Endowment=


The university receives income from an endowment known as the Permanent University Fund (PUF), with $11.6 billion (List of U.S. colleges and universities by endowment|fourth-largest in the United States) in assets as of November 2005,;; of which 30 percent is dedicated to the university.;As required by the Texas Constitution[http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001800.html], the UT System gets two-thirds of the Available University Fund, the annual distribution of PUF income. A regental policy[http://www.utsystem.edu/OGC/RegentalPolicies/AUFspend.htm] requires that ''at least'' 45 percent of this money go to UT Austin for &quot;program enrichment.&quot; By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, we get 30 percent which is the ''minimum'' amount of AUF income that can be distributed to UT Austin under current policies. The Regents, however, can and do decide to allocate additional amounts to UT Austin. Also, the majority of the UT System share of the AUF is used for debt service of UT System bonds, some of which were issued for the benefit of UT Austin[http://www.utsystem.edu/CONT/REPORTS/LARs/AUFLAR-102704.pdf]. One should note that the Regents are free to change the 45 percent minimum of the UT System share going to UT Austin at any time, although doing so might be difficult politically.; Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of this fund. At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas's two university systems, The University of Texas System and Texas A&amp;M University System|the Texas A&amp;M University System; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10percent of the universities' annual budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion to the University's total endowment value.
