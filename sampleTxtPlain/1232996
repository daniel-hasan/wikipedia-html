Derry City Football Club (, ) is an Irish football club based in Derry, Northern Ireland. It plays in the FAI Premier Division, the top tier of league football in the Republic of Ireland, and is the only participating club from Northern Ireland. The club's home ground is the Brandywell and the team wears red and white striped shirts from which its nickname, the Candystripes, derives.;[http://www.albionroad.com/clubs_details.aspx?id=210 Derry City], ''Albion Road'', 2007. Retrieved on 8 June 2007.;Others refer to the club as the Red and White Army or abbreviate the name to Derry or City.;&quot;[http://www.gettogether.at/derry/index.php/content/view/175/101/ Derry City 4-0 Sligo Rovers]&quot;, ''GetTogether.at'', 17 October 2006. Retrieved on 8 June 2007.;

The club, founded in 1928, initially played in the Irish League, the domestic league in Northern Ireland, and won a title in 1964&amp;ndash;65. In 1971, security concerns related to unrest in Northern Ireland meant matches could not be played at the Brandywell. The team played &quot;home&quot; fixtures 30 miles away in Coleraine. Security forces withdrew their objections to the use of the Brandywell the following year, but in the face of insistence from the Irish League that the unsustainable arrangement continue, the club withdrew from the league. After 13 years in junior football, they joined the League of Ireland's new First Division for 1985&amp;ndash;86. Derry won the First Division title and achieved promotion to the Premier Division in 1987, and have remained there since. The club went on to win a domestic treble in 1988&amp;ndash;89 and the Premier Division again in 1996&amp;ndash;97.

Founded in 1928, the club decided against using the official title of the city — Derry-Londonderry name dispute|Londonderry — in their name,;Nationalists generally refer to the city as &quot;Derry&quot;, while unionists often term it &quot;Londonderry&quot;. In 1928, however, the name dispute was not as politicised as it is today.

Retrieved on 2007-04-30.; As the republican locality surrounding the Brandywell saw some of the worst violence, numerous unionist-supported clubs were reluctant to play there. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) ruled the zone unsafe for fixtures and with the use of no other local ground feasible, Derry had to travel to the majority unionist town of Coleraine, over 30&amp;nbsp;miles away, to play their &quot;home&quot; games at the Showgrounds. This situation lasted from September 1971 until October 1972 when, faced with dwindling crowds (most Derry fans were unwilling to travel to Coleraine due to the political situation and the longer journey) and dire finances, the club formally requested permission to return to the Brandywell. Despite a new assessment by the security forces concluding that the Brandywell was no longer any more dangerous than any other league ground and a lifting of the security ban, football rivalies were seen as echoing of the wider sectarian nature of Northern Irish society and Derry's proposal fell by one vote at the hands of their fellow Irish League teams.; Continuing without a ground was seen as unsustainable and on Friday 13 October, 1972 Derry withdrew from the league amidst a perception that they were effectively forced out while a complex of victimisation and marginalisation developed within the nationalist community behind the club.;;;;;

The club continued as a junior team during the 13-year long The Wilderness Years (Derry City F.C.)|&quot;wilderness years&quot;, playing in the local Saturday morning league, and sought re-admission to the Irish League.; Each time, the club nominated the Brandywell as its chosen home-ground but the Irish League refused re-admission. Suspecting refusal was driven by sectarianism,; and believing they would never gain re-admission, Derry turned their attentions elsewhere.;

Plans of Derry City's to purchase a pitch fell through after their formation due to the tight time-scale between their birth in 1928 and the season's beginning in 1929 and so the Londonderry Corporation (now the Derry City Council) was approached for the use of the Brandywell which had been used for football up until the end of the 19th century. They agreed and the club still operate under the constraints of the Honourable the Irish Society charter limitations which declare that the Brandywell must be available for the recreation of the community. In effect, the club do not have private ownership and, thus, cannot develop by their own accord with that discretion or whether to sell being left to the Derry City Council.;;;i); &quot;[http://www.eleven-a-side.com/premier/irish_soccer_detail.asp?newsid=16140 Derry fans make stadium plea]&quot;, ''Eleven-a-side.com'', 2005-02-22.

Derry City supporters in the Brandywell.
Derry City's first game at the Brandywell was a 2&amp;ndash;1 loss to Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran on 22 August, 1929.; In 1933, the purchase of Bond’s Field in the Waterside was mentioned, but it was thought to be too far away from the fan-base which had built up on the Cityside, especially in the Brandywell area. They also had first option on Derry Celtic’s old ground, Celtic Park, but hesitated on a final decision and the Gaelic Athletic Association bought it ten years later. They also decided against buying Meenan Park for £1,500.; 

Because of Northern Ireland's volatile political situation during the Troubles and security fears for Protestants and those of the unionist tradition visiting the mainly nationalist city of Derry, the Brandywell has not always been the home ground of Derry City. In 1970 and 1971, Derry had to play their &quot;home&quot; ties against Linfield at Windsor Park in Belfast &amp;mdash; the home-ground of Linfield. From September 1971 until October 1972 Derry were forced to play all their &quot;home&quot; games at the Showgrounds in mainly Protestant Coleraine, over 30&amp;nbsp;miles away, as police ruled the republican Brandywell area as too unsafe for visiting unionists. The Brandywell did not see senior football for another 13 years as the Irish Football League upheld a ban on the stadium and Derry decided to leave the league as a result.; Only greyhound meetings and junior football were held during this time.; Derry's admission to the League of Ireland in 1985 saw a return of senior games.

Derry City FC currently bans the display of national flags at all games in the Brandywell. This rule in particular extends to away fans from the south of the border who are not permitted to display tri-colours with team slogans etc on them as they would at other Eircom League grounds. However, this does not apply to European competition when Derry City FC openly displays the national flag of Ireland as representatives of the Football Association of Ireland.

In popular culture

The single cover for ''My Perfect Cousin'' by The Undertones featuring a Derry City figurine.
Derry City have made numerous appearances in popular culture. In the world of music, the club were given exposure by Derry punk band, The Undertones, who had the cover of their 1980 hit single, ''My Perfect Cousin'', feature a Subbuteo figure sporting the colours of Derry City. The song's video saw the group's front-man, Feargal Sharkey, kick and leap to head a ball while wearing the red and white jersey.;Bradley, Michael. &quot;[http://derrycityfc.net/club/folklore/myperfectcousin.php The Undertones Connection]&quot;, ''CityWeb'', 1991-11-07. Retrieved on 2007-04-30.; Similarly, on the cover of their second ever single, ''Get Over You'', the words &quot;Derry City F.C.&quot; can be seen.;;

The club have also featured on popular television. Due to the fact that they are a club based in Northern Ireland playing in the league of the Republic of Ireland they often receive the attention of broadcasters in both jurisdictions. In the BBC documentary series ''Who Do You Think You Are?'' shown the night before Derry's clash with Paris St. Germain in the 2006&amp;ndash;07 UEFA Cup's First Round, it was highlighted that Archie McLeod, the grandfather of David Tennant, the ''Doctor Who'' actor, was a Derry City player. Derry had supplied a lucrative signing-on fee and had enticed him over from Scotland.;Barratt, Dr. Nick. &quot;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory/get_started/wdytya_celeb_gallery_04.shtml Who do you think you are? (Third series): David Tennant]&quot;, ''BBC History'', 2006-09-27. Retrieved on 2007-04-30.; Likewise, features about the club were run by ''Football Focus'' prior to and after the same UEFA Cup game. Irish television has also featured the club. Derry City played in the first League of Ireland match ever to be shown live on television when they visited Tolka Park to play Shelbourne during the 1996&amp;ndash;97 season. The game was broadcast on RTÉ|RTÉ's Network 2 and finished 1&amp;ndash;1 with Gary Beckett scoring for Derry.

Another medium to play host to the club has been the radio. On 20 April, 2005, Derry City featured in an audio documentary ''The Blues and the Candy Stripes'' on RTÉ Radio 1|RTÉ Radio 1's ''Documentary on One''. The documentary was produced in the aftermath of the historic friendly game between Derry and Linfield that took place on 22 February, 2005 — the first between the two teams to occur since a game on 25 January, 1969 during which Linfield's fans had to be evacuated from the Brandywell by police at half-time due to civil unrest and ugly scenes within the ground.;&quot;[http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/1044693.html The Blues and the Candy Stripes]&quot;, ''RTÉ.ie'', 2005-04-20. Retrieved on 2007-04-30.; The 2005 match was organised as a kind of security test in the run-up to the likely possibility that both teams, with socially polar fan-bases, would qualify for and be drawn against one another in a near-future Setanta Cup competition.;

The connection is rooted mainly in geography, as well as social, cultural and historical circumstances, as opposed to the club or its fans pushing towards the creation of a certain identity.; The club has a small minority of supporters of a Protestant upbringing.
