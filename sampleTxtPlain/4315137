''Kiwa hirsuta'' is a crustacean discovered in 2005 in the South Pacific Ocean&amp;nbsp;;;. This decapod, which is approximately 15&amp;nbsp;cm (6&amp;nbsp;inches) long, is notable for the quantity of silky blond setae (resembling fur) covering its pereiopods (thoracic legs, including claws). Its discoverers dubbed it the &quot;yeti lobster&quot; or &quot;yeti crab&quot;&amp;nbsp;;;.

''K. hirsuta'' was discovered in March 2005 by a group organised by Robert Vrijenhoek of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Monterey, California and Michel Segonzac of the Ifremer., using the submarine DSV ''Alvin'', operating from RV ''Atlantis''&amp;nbsp;;;. The discovery was announced on the 7th of March, 2006. It was found 1,500&amp;nbsp;km (900&amp;nbsp;miles) south of Easter Island in the South Pacific, at a depth of 2,200&amp;nbsp;m (7,200&amp;nbsp;feet), living on hydrothermal vents along the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge&amp;nbsp;;;. Based on both morphology and molecular data, the species was deemed to form a new genus and family (Kiwaidae). The animal has strongly reduced eyes that lack pigment, and is thought to be blind.

The 'hairy' pincers contain filamentous bacteria, which the creature may use to detoxify poisonous minerals from the water emitted by the hydrothermal vents where it lives. Alternatively, it may feed on the bacteria, although it is thought to be a general carnivore&amp;nbsp;;. Its diet also consists of green algae and small shrimp.

Although it is often referred to as the &quot;furry lobster&quot; outside the scientific literature&amp;nbsp;;, ''Kiwa hirsuta'' is not a true lobster but is more closely related to squat lobsters and hermit crabs. The term &quot;furry lobster&quot; is more commonly used for the genus ''Palinurellus''.

Etymology
Macpherson ''et al.'' named the genus ''Kiwa'' after &quot;the goddess of the shellfish in the Polynesian mythology&quot;, although Kiwa is a male guardian of the sea in Maori mythology&amp;nbsp;;;. ''Hirsuta'' means &quot;hairy&quot; in Latin.
