History
The team has played indoor and outdoor soccer since 1986, have been National Indoor Champions on two occasions, in 1986 and 1989, and have gone through numerous incarnations and name-changes during their 20 year history. The club was originally known as Garland Genesis and was a founding member of the SISL based in Garland, Texas. The team moved to Arlington, Texas during their first season and changed their name to the Addison Arrows. The team was renamed North Texas United after their move to Dallas/Fort Worth area prior to the 1990 outdoor season. They then merged with the Waco Kickers and became the Fort Worth Kickers before the 1990/91 indoor season, became the Dallas Kickers for the 1991/92 indoor season, and then the Dallas Americans before the 1992 outdoor season. They were renamed the Dallas/Fort Worth Toros in 1993, and remained as such until 1996, when they were renamed the Dallas Toros for the 1997 outdoor season. They became the Texas Toros in 1999, and the Texas Rattlers for the 2000 season. Upon their move to the Premier Development League for 2001 they changed their name, and were bought by the Texas Spurs, which they maintained until 2003, when the Spurs club sold the team to the owner of the Euless Texas indoor facility, they finally took their current name, the DFW Tornados, beginning in 2004.
