Leopard syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant,;Coppin BD, Temple IK: Multiple lentigines syndrome (LEOPARD syndrome or progressive cardiomyopathic lentiginosis). J Med Genet 1997 Jul; 34(7): 582-6; multisystem disease caused by a mutation in the protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 gene (PTPN11). The disease is a complex of features, mostly involving the skin, skeletal and cardiovascular systems, they may or may not be present in all patients. The nature of how the mutation causes each of the condition's symptoms is not well known, however research is ongoing.Related to Noonan syndrome, Leopard syndrome is caused by a different missense mutation of the same gene. Leopard syndrome may also be called multiple lentigines syndrome, cardiomyopathic lentiginosis, Gorlin's syndrome II, Capute-Rimoin-Konigsmark-Esterly-Richardson syndrome, or Moynahan syndrome. Noonan syndrome is fairly common, affecting 1:1000 to 1:2500 live births, Neurofibromatosis 1 (once thought to be related to Leopard syndrome) is also common affecting 1 in 3500 individuals, however no epidemiologic data exists for Leopard syndrome.;Tullu MS, Muranjan MN, Kantharia VC, Parmar RC, Sahu DR, Bavdekar SB, Bharucha BA.

Diagnosis
Three-quarter facial view, first generation patient showing slight prognathism and low set ears.
Thirty seven year old, second generation patient, exhibiting hypertelorism, broad nasal root, slight ptosis
The name of the condition is a mnemonic, originally coined in 1969,;Gorlin, R. J.; Anderson, R. C.; Blaw, M. E. :
Multiple lentigines syndrome: complex comprising multiple lentigines, electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary stenosis, abnormalities of genitalia, retardation of growth, sensorineural deafness, and autosomal dominant hereditary pattern. Am. J. Dis. Child. 117: 652-662, 1969.
PubMed ID : 5771505; as the condition is characterized by some of the following seven conditions, the first letters of which spell leopard, along with the characteristic &quot;freckling&quot; of the skin, caused by the lentigines that is reminiscent of the large cat.
* Lentigines - Reddish-brown to dark brown macules (surface skin lesion) generally occurring in a high number (10,000+) over a large portion of the skin, at times higher than 80% coverage. These can even appear inside the mouth (buccal), or on the surface of the eye (scleral). These have irregular borders and range in size from 1 mm in diameter to caf√©-au-lait spot's, several cm's in diameter. Also, some areas of vitiligo-like hypopigmentation may be observed.

* Electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities: Generally observed on an electrocardiograph as a bundle branch block.

* Ocular hypertelorism: Wideset eyes, which lead to a similar facial resemblance between patients. Facial abnormalities are the second highest occurring symptom after the lentigines. Abnormalities also include: broad nasal root, prognathism (protruding lower jaw), or low-set, possibly rotated, ears.

* Pulmonary stenosis: Narrowing of the pulmonary artery as it exits the heart. Other cardiac abnormalities may be present, including aortic stenosis, or mitral valve prolapse.

* Abnormal genitalia: (usually cryptorchidism (retention of testicles in body) or monorchism (single testicle). In female patients, this presents as missing or single ovaries, much harder by nature to detect. Ultrasound imaging is performed at regular intervals, from the age of 1 year, to determine if ovaries are present.

* Retarded growth: Slow, or stunted growth. Most newborns with this syndrome are of normal birth weight and length, but will often slow within the first year.

* Deafness: Sensorineural (nerve deafness).

The presence of all of these hallmarks is not needed for a diagnosis. A clinical diagnosis is considered made when, with lentigines present there are 2 other symptoms observed, such as ECG abnormalities and ocular hypertelorism, or without lentigines, 3 of the above conditions are present, with a first-degree relative (i.e. parent, child, sibling) with a clinical diagnosis.

There is a genetic test for this disease. In a study of 10 infants with clinical indications of Leopard syndrome prior to their first birthday, 8 (80%) patients were confirmed to have the suspected mutation. An additional patient, with the suspected mutation was subsequently found to have NF1, following evaluation of the mother.;Digilio, M. C.; Sarkozy, A.; de Zorzi, A.; Pacileo, G.; Limongelli, G.; Mingarelli, R.; Calabro, R.; Marino, B.; Dallapiccola, B. :
LEOPARD syndrome: clinical diagnosis in the first year of life. Am. J. Med. Genet. 140A: 740-746, 2006;

There are 5 identified allelic variants responsible for Leopard syndrome. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=176876&amp;a=176876_AllelicVariant0005 Y279C], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=176876&amp;a=176876_AllelicVariant0006 T468M], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=176876&amp;a=176876_AllelicVariant0020 A461T], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=176876&amp;a=176876_AllelicVariant0021 G464A], and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=176876&amp;a=176876_AllelicVariant0022 Q510P] which seems to be a unique familial mutation, in that all other variants are caused by transition errors, rather than transversion.

History
Torso of thirty seven year old, second generation patient, exhibiting lentiginosis.
Zeisler and Becker first described a syndrome with multiple lentigines, hypertelorism, pectus carinatum (protruding breastbone) and prognathism (protrusion of lower jaw) in 1936.;[http://www.emedicine.com/DERM/topic627.htm Drs Sergiusz Jozwiak, Robert A. Shwartz, et al.];Sporadic descriptions were added through the years. In 1962, cardiac abnormalities and short stature were first associated with the condition.;Moynahan, E. J. :
Multiple symmetrical moles, with psychic and somatic infantilism and genital hypoplasia: first male case of a new syndrome. Proc. Roy. Soc. Med. 55: 959-960, 1962; In 1966, three familial cases were added, a mother, her son and daughter.;Walther, R. J.; Polansky, B.; Grots, I. A. :
Electrocardiographic abnormalities in a family with generalized lentigo. New Eng. J. Med. 275: 1220-1225, 1966.
PubMed ID : 5921856 ; Another case of mother to two separate children, with different paternity of the two children, was added in 1968.; Matthews, N. L. :
Lentigo and electrocardiographic changes. New Eng. J. Med. 278: 780-781, 1968.
PubMed ID : 5638719 ; It was believed as late as 2002;[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2006/MB_cgi?mode=&amp;term=LEOPARD+Syndrome&amp;field=entry National Library of Medicine MeSH:	C05.660.207.525]; that Leopard syndrome was related to Neurofibromatosis 1, also known as von Recklinghausen syndrome. In fact, since both ICD9 and ICD10 lack a specific diagnosis code for Leopard syndrome, the diagnosis code for NF1 is still sometimes used for diagnostic purposes, although it has been shown that the gene is not linked to the NF1 locus.;Edman Ahlbom, B.; Dahl, N.; Zetterqvist, P.; Anneren, G. :
Noonan syndrome with cafe-au-lait spots and multiple lentigines syndrome are not linked to the neurofibromatosis type 1 locus. Clin. Genet. 48: 85-89, 1995.
PubMed ID : 7586657 ;

Epidemiology
Various literature describes it as being &quot;rare&quot;;[http://www.emedicine.com/DERM/topic627.htm Drs Sergiusz Jozwiak, Robert A. Shwartz, et al.]; or &quot;extremely rare&quot;.;[http://www.rarediseases.org/search/rdbdetail_abstract.html?disname=LEOPARD%20Syndrome NORD]; There is no epidemiologic data available, regarding how many in the world population suffer from the syndrome, however there are slightly over 100 cases described in medical literature.

Additional symptoms
Hand of thirty seven year old patient showing interdigital webbing
*additional dermatologic abnormalities (axillary freckling, localized hypopigmentation, interdigital webbing, hyperelastic skin)
*Mild mental retardation is observed in about 30% of those affected with the syndrome
*Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), seizures, or hyposmia (reduced ability to smell) has been documented in a few patients
*In 2004, a patient was reported with recurrent upper extremity aneurysms that required surgical repairs.;Yagubyan M, Panneton JM, Lindor NM, et al: LEOPARD syndrome: a new polyaneurysm association and an update on the molecular genetics of the disease. J Vasc Surg 2004 Apr; 39(4): 897-900;
*In 2006, a Leopard syndrome patient was reported with acute myelogenous leukemia.;Ucar C, Calyskan U, Martini S, Heinritz W: Acute myelomonocytic leukemia in a boy with LEOPARD syndrome (PTPN11 gene mutation positive). J Pediatr Hematol Oncol 2006 Mar; 28(3): 123-5; 

Unfortunately, due to the rarity of the syndrome itself, it is hard to determine whether certain additional diseases are actually a threat of the syndrome. With a base population of possibly less than one thousand individuals, one or two outlying cases can skew the statistical population very quickly.

Prognosis and treatment
Thirty seven year old patient demonstrating hyperelasticity
In itself, Leopard syndrome is not a life threatening diagnosis, most people diagnosed with the condition live normal lives. Obstructive cardiomyopathy and other pathologic findings involving the cardiovascular system may be a cause of death in those whose cardiac deformities are profound. 

It is suggested that, once diagnosed, individuals be routinely followed by a cardiologist, endocrinologist, dermatologist, and other appropriate specialties as symptoms present.

Prevention and management
Leopard syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, although it can also arise due to spontaneous mutation.
21 month old, third generation patient, confirmed by genetic tests as [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=176876&amp;a=176876_AllelicVariant0005 Y279C], exhibiting ocular hyperteliorism, cephalofacial similarity.
It is recommended that those with the syndrome who are capable of having children seek genetic counseling prior to deciding to have children. As the syndrome presents frequently as a forme fruste (incomplete, or unusual form) variant, an examination of all family members must be undertaken.;[http://www.emedicine.com/DERM/topic627.htm Drs Sergiusz Jozwiak, Robert A. Shwartz, et al.]; As an autosomal dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child, that they will also be born with the syndrome. This does not take into account the possibility of the gene mutating, on its own, in a child of a Leopard syndrome patient who does not inherit the gene from the affected parent. Since the syndrome has a variable penetrance and expression, one generation may have a mild expression of the syndrome, while the next may be profoundly affected.

Once a decision to have children is made, and the couple conceives,the fetus is monitored during the pregnancy for cardiac evaluation. If a gross cardiac malformation is found, parents receive counseling on continuing with the pregnancy.

Other management is routine care as symptoms present:
# For those with endocrine issues (low levels of thyrotopin [a pituitary hormone responsible for regulating thyroid hormones], follicle stimulating hormone) drug therapy is recommended.
# For those who are disturbed by the appearance of lentigines, cryosurgery may be beneficial. Due to the large number of lentigines this may prove time consuming. An alternative treatment with tretinoin or hydroquinone creams may help.
# Drug therapies for those with cardiac abnormalities, as those abnormalities become severe enough to warrant the use of these therapies. ECG's are mandatory prior to any surgical interventions, due to possible arrythmia.;[http://www.emedicine.com/DERM/topic627.htm Drs Sergiusz Jozwiak, Robert A. Shwartz, et al.];

Molecular mechanics
In the two predominant mutations of Leopard syndrome ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=176876&amp;a=176876_AllelicVariant0005 Y279C] and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=176876&amp;a=176876_AllelicVariant0006 T468M]) the mutations cause a loss of catalytic activity of the SHP2 (a variant name for PTPN11) protein, which is a previously unrecognized behavior for this class of mutations.;Tartaglia, M.; Martinelli, S.; Stella, L.; Bocchinfuso, G.; Flex, E.; Cordeddu, V.; Zampino, G.; van der Burgt, I.; Palleschi, A.; Petrucci, T. C.; Sorcini, M.; Schoch, C.; Foa, R.; Emanuel, P. D.; Gelb, B. D. :
Diversity and functional consequences of germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations in human disease. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 78: 279-290, 2006.
PubMed ID : 16358218; This interferes with growth factor and related signalling. While further research confirms this mechanism,;Hanna N, Montagner A, Lee WH, et al: Reduced phosphatase activity of SHP-2 in LEOPARD syndrome: consequences for PI3K binding on Gab1. FEBS Lett 2006 May 1; 580(10): 2477-82;;Kontaridis MI, Swanson KD, David FS, et al: PTPN11 (Shp2) mutations in LEOPARD syndrome have dominant negative, not activating, effects. J Biol Chem 2006 Mar 10; 281(10): 6785-92; additional research is needed to determine how this relates to all of the observed effects of Leopard syndrome.
