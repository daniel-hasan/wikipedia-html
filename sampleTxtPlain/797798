''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' (''Biohazard 2'' in Japan) is a 2004 action horror film sequel to the 2002 film ''Resident Evil''. The film stars Milla Jovovich, Sienna Guillory, Oded Fehr and Mike Epps and was released in the United States on September 10, 2004 and in Japan on September 11, 2004.

The film was written by Paul W. S. Anderson and directed by Alexander Witt. Anderson could not direct the film due to his work on ''Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator'', but was involved in the film's pre- and post-production phases. A third film in the trilogy, ''Resident Evil: Extinction'', was released on September 21, 2007. ''Apocalypse'' borrows elements mainely from ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', and ''Resident Evil: Code Veronica''. 
 
Plot summary
The film begins with Alice (Milla Jovovich) recalling the key events from the first film. On September 29, 2002, exactly thirteen hours after the T-Virus outbreak in The Hive, the Umbrella Corporation sends in a research team to re-open the complex. The team enters The Hive through a secret insertion point beneath Raccoon City. Shortly after entering the research facility, the entire team is then slaughtered by the T-Virus zombies that had been sealed within the complex. With the entrance now open, Umbrella realizes that the highly infectious zombies will make their way to the surface and begin a full-scale outbreak on Raccoon City.

Some four hours later, much of Raccoon City lies in devastation after the outbreak. Umbrella has established a security perimeter around the city to keep the zombies in the quarantine area. As civilians reach the local checkpoints around the city, Umbrella operatives check them for infection. Soon, the infection reaches the quarantined gates, and Major Timothy Cain (Thomas Kretschmann), Umbrella's security general, orders all checkpoints closed for good, leaving no exceptions. All civilians are ordered to return to the city or Umbrella will open fire on them. 

Meanwhile, Alice wakes up in a downtown hospital, and recalls her recent memories. After surviving The Hive, Alice was recovered by Umbrella and used for experimentation. She has gained superhuman powers because the T-virus bonded with her on a cellular level. Outside, she sees the devastated streets and makes her way to a police car and after a quick search finds a shotgun and grabs it to face the coming apocalypse.

Elsewhere, Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and two other Umbrella soldiers link up with multiple S.T.A.R.S. (Resident Evil)|S.T.A.R.S. units and attempt to hold against an onslaught of zombies in the street. There are too many zombies to handle and they are eventually overrun. Carlos and his team fall back, but one is bitten and the group realize Umbrella had betrayed them.

Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) (a Raccoon S.T.A.R.S. unit member) together with Terri Morales (a news reporter) and Peyton Wells retreat to a church, where they are attacked by Lickers. They are saved by Alice, who informs them that Umbrella's next step will be to nuke Raccoon City to stop the infection and silence any survivors. They decide to join together to try and escape the city. 

Nemesis
Umbrella immediately sends their latest project, Nemesis to kill all S.T.A.R.S. operatives. He encounters L.J. (Resident Evil)|L.J. (Mike Epps), a cab driver, and thirteen other members of S.T.A.R.S, who begin to attack it. Nemesis shrugs off their small-arms fire and easily kills them all, but spares L.J. when he drops his weapons.

Dr. Charles Ashford, a key Umbrella scientist and creator of the T-virus, has refused extraction by Umbrella until he has located and rescued his daughter Angela. He hacks into Raccoon City's network of security cameras, and determines that she is at a school building. He also notices Alice and her group and contacts them, offering to arrange for an evacuation in exchange for rescuing Angela. Inside the school, the group encounters Carlos and his men, who have been given the same offer. After various encounters with List of Resident Evil creatures#Cerberus or Zombie Dog|zombie dogs and infected children who eventually kill Terri, Carlos becomes the last survivor of his men and Alice loses an ally as well, but they manage to find Angela, and the remaining survivors escape the school. 

Ashford gives them the location to the evacuation helicopter. Unfortunately Major Cain has been aware of the plan, and captures them, killing Ashford and sends Nemesis to fight Alice. She defeats Nemesis, but realizeshis true identity (her former friend, Matt Addison) and refuses to deliver the killing blow. Her mercy appears to rekindle a trace of Nemesis's former humanity, and they join forces and attack the Umbrella troops. Nemesis is killed in the ensuing fight, and Alice and the others escape in the helicopter, leaving Major Cain (unable to commit suicide because he has used up the available rounds in his handgun fending off the zombies) to be eaten just before the city is nuked.

The helicopter is caught up in the blast radius and crashes into the Arklay Mountains. Alice is impaled by a loose metal pole, presumably fatally, but she is found and recovered by Umbrella. She is taken to another Umbrella research station, where, after several weeks, she awakens in a giant water tank, completely healed of her injuries. Led by Umbrella scientist Dr. Isaacs, the doctors release and begin to question her. At first, she appears to have no memory, but soon a rapid series of images of recent events come flashing back in her mind, and she states with contempt &quot;''My name is Alice… and I remember everything.''&quot; She fights her way out of the facility showing some of her darkest powers yet, only to be surrounded by dozens of armed guards. Suddenly, Jill, Carlos, and L.J. pull up in a SUV, disguised as Umbrella employees. Carlos shows the guards a written order placing her in his custody. They allow Alice to go, and as she enters the waiting vehicle, she sees Angela in the back seat. As they drive away, Angela asks Alice if she is alright. Alice doesn't respond, and Dr. Isaacs is shown saying, &quot;Program Alice Activated.&quot; A close-up of her eye shows a flashing Umbrella logo as the film comes to an end.

Production
= Pre-production=
''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' was first discussed and hinted by both Milla Jovovich and Paul W. S. Anderson whilst promoting the first film. Paul stated that he began writing the screenplay for the second film after completing the first film, he also revealed character details of including the character of Jill Valentine meeting up with Alice,;
; however this idea was later scrapped as he wanted two separate stories occurring at the same time.;
; Paul also revealed that the film would only go ahead if the first film was a success and promised that ''&quot;the sequel will be even better, stating that there is so much more to the story that has yet to be told&quot;''.;
; The sequel was officially greenlit by Sony in mid 2002,; however Paul Anderson chose not to direct but rather stay on as the film's producer and writer due to commitments to ''Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator''.;;; 

Alexander Witt was later hired by Sony to direct the sequel.;; Milla Jovovich confirmed her character would return in the sequel if the first film was successful.; When the film was officially announced, Milla signed on to return as Alice.;
In March 2002, Eric Mabius (who played Characters in the Resident Evil films#Matt Addison|Matt Addison in the first film), confirmed that the story would revolve around his character becoming Nemesis. He also revealed he would portray the character and study his movements whilst playing ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', however before production began he pulled ;
; It was also previous reported that Gina Philips would appear as Claire Redfield and Natasha Henstridge as Jill Valentine, however both actresses left before production began.;; Sienna Guillory was later cast to portray Jill Valentine and Oded Fehr was cast as Carlos Olivera,;; while Claire Redfeild's role was scrapped after Emily Bergl was cast but later dropped the role.;; The role was later offered to Ali Larter in the film's sequel ''Resident Evil: Extinction|Extinction''. Jason Isaacs was originally intended to return and portray Dr. William Birkin,;; however passed on the role and the characters name was changed to Characters in the Resident Evil films#Dr. Isaacs|Dr. Isaacs as a homage with Iain Glen being cast to portray the role.

Jack Noseworthy was originally rumored to portray STARS members in Resident Evil#Brad Vickers|Brad Vickers, however was later proven to be only a rumor.;; 2 weeks before production began, Jared Harris was cast as a new character called Characters in the Resident Evil films#Dr. Ashford|Dr. Ashford who actually developed and produced the T-Virus.;;

In March 2002, it was revealed that the film would borrow plot elements from ''Resident Evil 2'' and ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', as the film's subtitle was revealed as being ''&quot;Resident Evil: Nemesis&quot;''.; It was also revealed the film would include characters from both the film series and the video game series such as Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, Carlos Olivera, Dr. William Birkin and Nemesis.;;;; In April 2003, it was confirmed that the story would begin minutes after the ending of the first film, where Alice is a survivor lurking amongst the ruins of Raccoon City.;;
The film itself borrowed numerous element from the game series including: the viral outbreak in Raccoon City, the Arklay Mountains incident, inclusion of numerous video game characters and the origins of the T-Virus. ;;

=Filming and Post-production=
''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' was filmed on location in Canada with the film entering pre-production stages in mid 2003 with principal photography to originally begin in July 2003; before being bumped up to August 6, 2003.;
; The film was shot in Ontario, Canada; with Toronto and its surrounding suburbs being a stand-in for Raccoon City. Toronto City Hall and Exhibition Place (namely the National Trade Centre) were used as Umbrella's worldwide headquarters, while the logos of Canada's largest banks feature prominently in the skyline shots of the city, and the Prince Edward Viaduct was used to represent Ravens Gate.;; It was originally feared that production would be shut down due to fears of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome#Canada|2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto;; however production resumed with filming ending in October 2003.;; 

=The Monsters=
Prior to filming, just as in the first movie, actors playing zombies were trained at a zombie &quot;boot camp.&quot; Actors were coached to act as zen-zombies (a creature that relentlessly follows its target) and ''liquid'' zombies. Anderson and other crew members were tempted to make the zombies move faster but decided that it would be breaking with a fundamental element of the games. 

Nemesis was an actor in a suit, Matthew G. Taylor, with only special-effects applied to certain parts of the characters body (such as the eye of the creature). Despite Taylor being 1.98 metres (approx. 6 feet, 6 inches) in height he was still considered too short, to hide this the character wears large boots and in many scenes the Nemesis was stretched to appear taller.

The same dog-team was used for the zombie-dogs as in the first. The look of the dogs was achieved through a combination of make-up and computer-effects. Due to the dogs' reluctance to dive through a sugar-glass window as they had done before, the window in the scene was done in CGI. 

The List of Resident Evil creatures#Licker|Lickers were fully computer-generated this time, though the use of physical puppets was considered for a while. To avert the problems faced during the production of the first film, the CGI work of the lickers began early in production.

=Marketing and Release= 
The film was originally planned for a October 31, 2003 release;; before being pushed back. 

The ''Regenerate'' &quot;commercial&quot;, directed by Marcus Nispel, was a teaser trailer for the second ''Resident Evil'' movie, and can be seen in the movie on a TV screen in the female scientist's house. It is reminiscent of the Olay product ''Regenerist'' advertisements.

''Regenerate'' is a skin care product (and registered trademark) of the Umbrella Corporation (motto: Our business is life itself), using the T-Virus to reanimate dead cells and make you more youthful looking. 

An ad similar to the Regenerate can be seen in ending credits. The ad states that the film is &quot;a product of the Umbrella Corporation.&quot; It ends with &quot;Some Side Effects may occur.&quot; The Women using the product then promptly turns into a zombie.

The teaser trailer is available from Sony Pictures in both RealMedia;http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/residentevilapocalypse/video/trailer/trailer_high.ram; and Windows Media formats.;http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/residentevilapocalypse/video/trailer/trailer_high.asx;

Reactions

''Apocalypse'' received even more negative reactions from the critics than the first film. The film appears only 20% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes (22 out of 112 reviews are counted fresh).;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil_apocalypse/; Tim Cogshell from the ''Box Office Magazine'' stated that ''Apocalypse'' is ''&quot;superior to the original film.&quot;'' Robert Dominguez, from ''New York Daily News'' stated that the film ''&quot;should please the target audience.&quot;'' Walter Chaw from ''Film Freak Central'' states that ''Apocalypse'' is ''&quot;An awful sequel to an awful film.&quot;''

Film critic Victoria Alexander (from FilmsInReview.com) said “If you like tough chicks killing zombies, RE:A is for you,” although she nonetheless noted that “Screenwriter Paul W.S. Anderson doesn’t bog down the film with philosophical subtext or explain the zombies,” which she acknowledges are probably not “questions ...suitable for the demographics targeted.”;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil_apocalypse/;

Critic Sean Axmaker gave the film a grade of C+, and said that the director’s “headlong pace that favors action over spectacle... helps distract from all but the most contrived and absurd turns of Anderson's slapdash script.” Critic Dragan Antulovbigger gave the film 5/10. He noted the more spectacular setting (made possible by the bigger budget than the initial film), “deadlier weapons...[an] increased number of explosions[, and an] increased body count.” He said that despite the “shallowness of the content” there was “interesting production design and energetic direction.”;

Reviewer Roger Ebert gave the film one half of a star, calling it an “utterly meaningless waste of time”, “a dead zone, a film without interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and special effects.”Chris Alexander of Rue Morgue Magazine said that “RE2 is a dreary, incoherent mess of a movie, failing on almost every conceivable level and having the dubious distinction of rendering hordes of shambling, screaming cannibalistic zombies boring.” Alexander stated that the director “Witt can’t stage an action sequence,” said that the lead actress “looks bored,” called the score “useless” and said that the “effects are more like defects.”;

Film critic Rob Blackwelder called&quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; “inept, unoriginal, [and] asinine”, and stated that it is “on the Worst of 2004 list.” Blackwelder criticized the film as a
a “braindead disaster” with “pathetic... leaden mindlessness,” with “impossibly stupid and nonsensical plot defects.” He stated that the film was “overflowing with off-the-shelf action-hack staples” and “tiresome stereotypes,” and directed with a lack of “narrative or cinematic sense.”;

Walter Chaw of Film Freak Central, who gave the film half a star out of four, criticized the “shoddiness of the make-up” and the lack of “critical biographical/geographical details.” He states that the editing seems like it was “edited with a weed whacker.” Chaw notes that “an entire sequence” was “lifted whole from La Femme Nikita.” While Chaw admits to loving genre films, he states that films like this “lowe[r] the conversation even lower than it already is.” In all, Chaw says “no artistry[–] it ain't good.” Reviewer Anthony Del Valle calls the film “yawn of the dead,” and laments “how little the writer develops the idea, and how the director turns his back on every opportunity to creatively exploit the situation.;

=Box office=
The film grossed $23,036,273 on its opening weekend (September 10-12 2004). The film gained $51,201,453 domestically and $129,394,835 worldwide.; 

The film's success spawned one sequel, ''Resident Evil: Extinction|Extinction'', the official web-site of which claims it will be the last film in the series, although a fourth film is rumoured if Extinction does well at the box office.

Trivia

* The film's director Alexander Witt has a cameo in the film as the sniper on top of Raccoon City Hall.
*Ben Moody, former lead guitarist of the alternative rock band Evanescence, makes a brief cameo appearance as a zombie in the film, which is mentioned in the DVD audio commentary.
*The word &quot;zombie&quot; is never mentioned, following the example of the first film.
*Jills dead partner is Leon S. Kennedy which is mentioned in a newspaper

Game connections

The Arklay Mountains overlooking Raccoon City.
Introduction Scenes
* ''Apocalypse'' re-enacts certain scenes from the games (particularly the intro scenes):
:* The car crash scene that leaves Angela Ashford stuck in Raccoon City is reminiscent to the intro of ''Resident Evil 2'' , which forces Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield to separate on their way to the police station.
:* The scene where Alice runs through the building with an Umbrella helicopter firing at her, up to the point where she drops her gun, falls, re-grabs it and fires, is reminiscent to the intro scene of ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica'' in which Claire Redfield does the same thing.
:* The scene in which Raccoon City is being overrun by zombies, and the police and Umbrella mercenaries are fighting back, up to the point in which a zombie reflects off a fallen police helmet, is reminiscent to the intro scene of ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.'' The launching of the missile to complete sanitation is also a scene similar to that of one in the game.

Resident Evil
* The crash site of the helicopter is located in the Arklay Forest near the Arklay Mountains, where the ''Resident Evil'' series first began.
* In the abandoned church and school, Jill moves and points the gun the exact same way she does in the game.
* Terri's death is similar to Kenneth's death (''RE1'' remake) which is also recorded, though the latter was mauled by the zombie, not children.
* A white goddess statue can be seen in the church. Artwork of goddesses has a large role within the puzzles in the ''Resident Evil'' series.
*On the ''Arklay Overpass'', Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford may just be watching them on the cameras, as if the whole thing were some sort of sick game. ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' is, of course, an adaptation of a series of games and the fixed camera perspective in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective.
* The scene were Jill finds a gun under the church is mirroring when you play the game you find ammo or guns in certain areas

Resident Evil 2
* Alice's visit to the gun shop at the start of ''Apocalypse'' is a reference to ''Resident Evil 2'', where Leon takes shelter in a gun shop.
* The character Angela Ashford may be a concept borrowed from Sherry Birkin, as they are both children, dressed in school uniforms, in need of rescue. Both of their fathers are also researchers working for Umbrella. The Ashford name, however, comes from the founders of Umbrella revealed in ''Resident Evil : Code Veronica''.

Resident Evil 3: Nemesis
* Jill wears the same outfit from ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'' with only minor changes.
* Like his video game counterpart, Nemesis only speaks one word (&quot;S.T.A.R.S.&quot;). Unlike his video game counterpart, he only speaks this line once whereas in the game, Nemesis speaks this line constantly during every encounter.
* The graveyard scene is a reference to the ''Resident Evil Remake'', ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', and ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica'', where zombies also pop out of their graves.
* The nuclear weapon approach and explosion is a shot-for-shot recreation of the equivalent scene in the videogame's finale.
*There is, what seems to be a clocktower in the background in the movie. This could possibly be linked to the clocktower that is seen in the game.

Game and Movie Differences

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|- bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;
! Movie !! Games
|- 
| Jill was suspended from S.T.A.R.S. after events unknown. They are never explained. In the novelization Jill was suspended due to her report on zombies in the forest, but this is not canon.
| Jill resigns from S.T.A.R.S. after all attempts to expose the events at the mansion are ignored or blocked by R.P.D. Chief Brian Irons (who subsequently disbanded the unit), on William Birkin's payroll. She resigns to investigate Umbrella's doings in Raccoon City full time.
|- 
| Raccoon City is nuked by Umbrella in an effort to cover up the outbreak. With Umbrella's marketing and economic muscle, they are able to manipulate the media into reporting it as an incident at the nuclear plant.
|The US government orders a missile strike on Raccoon City after a group of Tyrants defeated elements of the armed forces in a battle near an abandoned factory on the outskirts of the town (the aftermath of this battle can be seen in ''Resident Evil 3''). Despite the political maneuvering of Umbrella, who wanted to study the effects of the city-wide infection, the strike is initiated. Later on in ''Resident Evil 4'', it is known that the US government suspended the activities of Umbrella.
|-
|The T-Virus can be used for medical applications. It helped Angie to walk.
|In the games the virus is said to regenerate body cells, but it is unknown whether it works correctly to all body cells and can actually create a 'cure' for (muscle) disease, and if it can be controlled by an anti-virus. The only proven application of the T-Virus is to create bioweapons. 
|-
|Lickers are created by injecting the T-Virus directly into living tissue. When they taste fresh blood, they mutate.
|Lickers are created when people infected by the T-Virus are exposed to a second dose. These creatures are accidental and were created due to the circumstances of the outbreak. They do not mutate after tasting blood.
|-
|Nemesis is killed after defending Alice from gunfire. It might be possible that the damage it received wasn't bad enough to make it mutate, but this is only a suggestion from the game. Though itsmutations from Nemesis did not really show.

|Nemesis is killed after being dodged by Jill for a majority of the outbreak. After a series of battles, the Nemesis is reduced to a nebulous blob finally put to rest by one shot from the &quot;Paracelsus Sword&quot; weapon, a fixed magnetic coil gun brought in by US armed forces to fight off a squad of Tyrants; and if so chosen by the player, five rounds from Jill's magnum revolver.
|-
|Nemesis does not have tentacles, but does have a Gatling Gun and Rocket Launcher.
|Nemesis uses his T- infected tentacles (Actually the 'roots' of the Nemesis-parasite coming out through the host's body) to attack enemies as well as a Rocket Launcher. S.T.A.R.S. member Brad Vickers was killed with his tentacles, and later resumed animation as a zombie (only to be killed by either Leon S. Kennedy or Claire Redfield).
|-
|The outbreak in Raccoon occurred as a result of Umbrella researchers re-opening the Hive. The city is infected within hours.
|The outbreak occurs as a combination of monsters left over from the mansion incident and an assassination attempt on William Birkin for his G-Virus sample. As the assassin escaped with his work, Birkin injects himself with the G-Virus and wreaks havoc. In the process, the T-Virus is spilled and the rodent population in the sewer are infected, slowly spreading the virus to the citizens. The city is infected in less than a week.
|-
|The T-Virus is said to cause uncontrolled mutation.
|The G-Virus is the only virus that mutates uncontrollably and it cannot be passed by bites, but according to Anette Birkin (William Birkin's wife) &quot;it is able to revitalize cellular functions&quot;. It requires direct inoculation or embryos implanted on a genetically compatible host. However in ''Resident Evil 2'' the T-Virus is described as &quot;a mutagenic toxin&quot;, and even though most of its victims turn into zombies, other creatures such as the lickers, the Tyrant and (possibly) Nemesis, giant spiders, mutated sharks, and oversized lampreys are products of infection. No positive effects of the T-virus have been observed in the games.
|-
|The Umbrella Corporation publicly flaunts their wealth and power. They funded the construction of Raccoon City and have great power worldwide.
|The Umbrella Corporation is a powerful company, yet they deal mostly in secret. Though their contributions have led to the development of Raccoon City, they do not flaunt their international power openly. To the public, they're known as a simple medical/health corporation, akin to Pfizer.
|-
|Nemesis was created as part of the &quot;Nemesis Program&quot;, a project to create the ultimate bioweapon. It was created in America. It was unleashed by Umbrella within Raccoon City to test its abilities such as wiping out S.T.A.R.S.
|The Nemesis was an experimental bio-weapon created by the European branch by implanting a new kind of parasiticorganism into an ordinary mass-produced Tyrant. In the first game it is revealed that the real reason for S.T.A.R.S involvement in the mansion incident was Albert Wesker's intention to test the bioweapons against &quot;realistic targets&quot; (armed, trained paramilitaries/military personnel). Nemesis takes time to train and perfect, since they are programmed to hunt specific targets. In ''Resident Evil 3'', its mission was to hunt down and kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. due to their involvement in the &quot;Mansion Incident.&quot;
|-
|Alice is forced to battle the Nemesis as a final &quot;test&quot; by Major Timothy Cain to determine which bioweapon is the most powerful.This takes place before the Nemesis' death while trying to save Alice and the survivors after decidingly revolting against his creators.
|Jill Valentine is forced to defeat the Nemesis, now a gelatinous blob of organs, as it is preventing her to escape the factory towards the finale of the game.After being severely weakened by the &quot;Paracelsus Sword&quot; rail gun, Jill empties her Magnum into it, finishing it off completely.
|-
|Jill, Carlos, Angie, and L.J. free Alice from Umbrella headquarters after the Raccoon City nuking.
|Jill and Carlos escape from Raccoon (with or without Barry's help, depending on the ending). Where they head is unknown, but it seems they still intend to meet up with Chris Redfield in Europe.
|-
|Nicholai was a heroic, somewhat naive mercenary, eventually killed by two zombie dogs in the movie.
|Nicholai is a double-crossing, secret Umbrella agent, who is either killed by Nemesis, escapes in a helicopter or is shot down in a helicopter by Jill depending on the player's choices throughout the game. 
|-
|Nemesis is computer-controlled and can be programmed with commands remotely from a laptop.
|Nemesis is autonomous, and follows his pre-set commands to wipe out S.T.A.R.S.
|-
|Carlos' uniform shows his last name spelled &quot;Olivera.&quot;
|Carlos' last name is Oliveira.
|-
|The S.T.A.R.S. team consists of at least 25 operatives during the Raccoon City incident. Members include Jill Valentine, Peyton Wells, Commander Ryan Henderson and other unnamed characters. Chris and Barry (and other character from the games besides Jill) are nowhere to be seen.
|The S.T.A.R.S. team first consists of 11 members (excluding pilot Kevin Dooley), divided into two separate teams which were S.T.A.R.S.#Alpha Team|Alpha and S.T.A.R.S.#Bravo Team|Bravo. During their investigations of the Mansion incident, most of the team was killed off and reduced to 5 members when they escaped (without taking Wesker's revival into account). During the events of ''Resident Evil 3'', however, Brad Vickers, the pilot of Alpha Team, is killed by Nemesis in front of the R.P.D. Precinct.S.T.A.R.S. was disbanded by Chief Irons after the Arklay Mountain incident and the armed elite officers fighting the zombies were actually members of the newly created Raccoon Police Department#Select Police Force|Select Police Force.
