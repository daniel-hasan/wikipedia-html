The Golden Film is an initiative by the Netherlands Film Festival and the government-subsidized Netherlands Film Fund, with the support of Film Investors Netherlands, to increase the public's awareness of Dutch films in the Netherlands. The Golden Film recognises box office achievements to encourage positive publicity for a film after the initial media attention surrounding its release has begun to wane. The award is similar to the Dutch music industry's Golden Record, that is awarded after selling 40,000&amp;nbsp;singles, 35,000&amp;nbsp;popular music albums, or 15,000&amp;nbsp;classical music albums.; ;; ;

The Golden Film awards are presented during small press ceremonies throughout the year and shortly after a film has reached the audience criterion. The trophies are presented by the director of the Netherlands Film Festival or sometimes by a member of the crew or cast of the film itself.; ;; ;; ; Two trophies are presented for each film: one to the producer and the director, representing the film crew, and the other to the lead actors, representing the cast of the film.;

The trophy is a thick square frame, that contains a small square still from the receiving film.; ; The frame is made from milled wood, which has a plate attached to it, on the first line enscribed with the text &quot;Gouden Film&quot;, three squares, and the year, and on the second line with the film title.; ;

The Netherlands Film Festival and the Netherlands Film Fund announced the Golden Film on September 4, 2001 as an award for films from the Netherlands that had been seen by a paying audience of, at that time, 75,000 or more. The Platinum Film was introduced at the same time, for films with paying audiences of 200,000 or more. The first Golden Film was awarded on September 28, 2001 to ''I Love You Too'' (2001),; ; and by the end of 2002 a total of 10 Golden Films had been awarded.

Within 18 months of the award's introduction, the public's interest in Dutch films in the Netherlands had increased. The audience for Dutch films as a percentage of the total cinema audience in the Netherlands was 5.5% in 1999 and 5.9% in 2000. After the introduction of the award, audiences increased to 9.5% in 2001 and to 10.5% in 2002.;

In 2003, the criterion for the award was changed in an effort to further stimulate the Dutch film industry. Films released after January 1, 2003 had to reach paying audiences of 100,000 to qualify for the Golden Film and 400,000 for the Platinum Film.; All films that had received a Golden Film before 2003 would also have received a Golden Film under the new criterion.; ;; ; From 2003 until 2006, the percentage of cinema visitors who watched a Dutch film was between 9.20% and 13.26%.;

Since its introduction, the Golden Film has been awarded to &amp;nbsp;films. In 2004, nine films were awarded the Golden Film, the highest number to have received the award in a single year. Most of the films that are awarded the Golden Film have taken a week or more to reach the target audience figure. Only ''Full Moon Party'' (2002) and ''Black Book'' (2006) have reached the criterion, for respectively 75,000 and , during their opening weekends.; ;; ;

Response to the award
Dutch newspapers, such as ''Algemeen Dagblad'',; ; ''De Telegraaf'',; and ''NRC Handelsblad'',; report about films receiving the Golden Film. When the film ''De Scheepsjongens van Bontekoe'' (2007) had drawnto the cinema, the Dutch news agency Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau said the film had reached &quot;the magical threshold of 100,000&quot;.;

Recipients consider the Golden Film to be an indication for a film's success. Director Martin Koolhoven said, when ''Schnitzel Paradise'' (2005) received the award, that he did not expect his film to be such a success. ''Schnitzel Paradise'' was his first commercially successful film.; ; Fifteen-year-old Sem Veeger, lead actress in the film ''Keep Off'' (2006), said she knew that many people had seen the film, but she did not expect it to receive a Golden Film.; ;

Critics of the award have said that films which have sold only 75,000 orcannot be considered successful. In 2002, film journalist Ronald Ockhuysen said about the Golden Film:
;;A good idea â€“ in itself. (...) A positive signal towards the people. But it is doubtful whether the masses pick up the signal. 75,000&amp;nbsp;visitors makes a meagre, a poor appearance. Especially for films solely made for the masses, like Full Moon Party. Johan Nijenhuis, the director of Full Moon Party, has admitted outright that he considers only 300,000&amp;nbsp;visitors a failure.;;; Ockhuysen also wrote that the Golden Film is a &quot;child of our time&quot; because it tries to reduce the value of a film to its commercial success, and it is supporting films that already have large publicity budgets instead of smaller and more vulnerable productions.; Film producer Rob Houwer has said that he believes the Golden Film is the prize for a flop. In 2005, when the criterion for the award had already been increased from 75,000 to 100,000&amp;nbsp;visitors, he said in an interview:
;;It is really nothing at all. A failure. It starts to be something for a producer when 350,000 or more cinema tickets are sold. It is incomprehensible why there are media reporting about this award. Why does everybody accept this nonsense?; ;;;

Since the introduction of the Golden Film, the only Dutch film produced by Rob Houwer was ''Het Woeden der Gehele Wereld'' (2006), which sold only 4,000 cinema tickets.;

Notes
;
:* The phrase &quot;the magical threshold of 100,000&quot; is a translation of the Dutch phrase &quot;de magische grens van 100.000&quot; that was used by the ANP.;
:* The original quotation of Ronald Ockhuysen in Dutch: &quot;Een goed idee - op zichzelf. (...) 'Een positief signaal naar de mensen toe.' Alleen is het twijfelachtig of het grote publiek dat signaal wel oppikt. 75 Duizend bezoekers heeft iets schraals, iets armoedigs. Zeker als een film, zoals Volle Maan, louter en alleen is gemaakt voor een massapubliek. Johan Nijenhuis, regisseur van Volle Maan, heeft ruiterlijk toegegeven dat hij 300 duizend bezoekers als een mislukking beschouwt.&quot;;
:* The original quotation of Rob Houwer in Dutch: &quot;Dat is echt helemaal niks. Een mislukking. Pas vanaf zo'n 350 duizend verkochte bioscoopkaartjes begint het voor de producent ergens op te lijken. Het is onbegrijpelijk dat de media over die prijs berichten. Waarom slikt iedereen deze ongein voor zoete koek?&quot;;
