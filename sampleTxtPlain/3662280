Humphreys started his career with Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday in 1996. Whilst with the club, he was loaned out to Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United and Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City. He left the club in 2001 and joined Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United for a short period, after which he joined current club Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United. He joined Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale on loan in 2006.

Childhood and early career
Humphreys was introduced to football from an early age, his grandfather, Ernest Humphreys, played for Millwall F.C.|Millwall, Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell and St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren. His dad, John Humphreys, also had trials with Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United.;;

Humphreys grew up as a Sheffield United fan and joined their academy, which he described as a &quot;dream come true&quot;. However, they released him when we he was 13.;; 

Humphreys then played for the Sheffield Boys and was one of their few players who did not play for a professional club. However, that soon changed when Humphreys was scouted by a Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday scout and he joined their centre of excellence.;;

Sheffield Wednesday
In 1995, after leaving Newfield Secondary School, Humphreys became part of Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday’s youth squad. For the youth squad Humphreys played as a Midfielder#Winger|left winger and was offered a professional contract.;; Due to the injuries of strikers David Hirst and Mark Bright, Wednesday manager David Pleat gave Humphreys the opportunity to go on Wednesday’s Season_%28sports%29#Pre-season|pre-season tour of the Netherlands.;;
 
Humphreys played the first game and scored twice. He then played in the second game against FC Utrecht and scored again. Johan Cruijff was the guest of honour for that game and he praised Humphreys and said he was the next Marco van Basten.;;;; Humphreys pre-season form earned him a full league debut in Wednesday’s opening match against Aston Villa. In this match Humphreys scored a goal that was recorded at 95.9mph, one of the hardest goals in the history of football.;; Humphreys also scored in the following match against Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United. Two games later, Humphreys scored a much talked about goal when he went on a 50 yard run and scored a spectacular chipped goal against Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City.;;;; Humphreys was seen as the driving force behind Sheffield Wednesday's shock early lead at the top of The Premiership.;;

His form linked him to a £4 million transfer to Leeds United.;; However Humphreys remained at Sheffield Wednesday and played 34 games for them in the 1996-97 in English football|1996&amp;ndash;97 season. His performances earned him a place in the England team for the 1997 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Malaysia.;; Humphreys wore the much coveted Number_9#In_sports|number 9 shirt for that tournament. 

For the next two seasons, after Sheffield Wednesday signed an influx of foreign players such as Paulo Di Canio and Benito Carbone, Humphreys failed to hold down a regular place and he only played a total of 31 games in those two seasons.;;;;;; Humphreys was then sent on loan to Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff where he played 11 matches, scoring twice.;;;; He was then sent on loan to Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United in August 1999,;; where he played six matches and again scored twice.;; After a brief return to the Wednesday side for the 2000-01 in English football|2000&amp;ndash;01 season, Humphreys decided to leave Wednesday in order to play more first team football was allowed to join Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United on trial.;; Humphreys impressed on trial scoring 3 goals in 7 games and it looked likely that Cambridge manager Roy McFarland was going to offer him a contract. However, Humphreys' trial was cut abruptly after he broke his foot.;; After the sacking of Roy McFarland, new Cambridge manager John Beck was reluctant to offer Humphreys a new contract until he had seen him play.;;

Hartlepool United
Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United manager Chris Turner (footballer b. 1958)‎|Chris Turner then offered Humphreys the chance to train with the club. Shortly after Humphreys signed a new contract with the club, much to the dismay of Cambridge fans who wanted him to stay and described him as &quot;a big loss&quot;.;; Humphreys started the 2001-02 in English football|2001&amp;ndash;02 season partnering Kevin Henderson up front for the first 9 league games. However after a bad run Humphreys was dropped and replaced by new signing Gordon Watson. However, Humphreys would force his way back into the team and replace Henderson to partner Watson instead, these two players were already familiar with each other from their days at Sheffield Wednesday.;; Despite not scoring many goals Hartlepool manager Chris Turner was pleased with his performances.;; Humphreys was then moved into central midfield due to the injury of Tommy Widdrington and after impressing played there for the remainder of the season.;; Ritchie Humphreys is consoled by team mates after his play-off semi final penalty miss against Cheltenham Town F.C.|CheltenhamHumphreys' first season at the club would end in disappointment as he missed the decisive penalty in the The_Football_League#The_Play-Offs|play-off semi final defeat to Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town, which cost Hartlepool a place in Division Two. The penalty struck the woodwork twice and stayed out.;; Humphreys' miss would send him to tears and he was photographed by Frank Reid, a photograph that would prove to be one of the most memorable images of Reid and Humphreys' career.;; After his miss Humphreys was devastated but he was cheered up by Chris Turner and the players who rang him and told him to keep his head up.;; Humphreys also received lots of letters of support from the Hartlepool fans.;

When Humphreys returned to pre-season training for the following season, he was playfully teased over his penalty miss.;; Humphreys took the motto &quot;that anything that doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger&quot; and was determined to come back stronger. Humphreys started the 2002-03 in English football|2002&amp;ndash;03 season with a goal against Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle on the opening day of the season.;; Throughout the course of the season, Humphreys would be played prominently as a left winger. Humphreys finished the season as an ever present in the Hartlepool squad, adding 11 goals to his name in the process and helped Hartlepool gain promotion to Division 2. His performances won him the Player of the Season award from the supporters.;;;; During this season it was revealed that Humphreys had been writing a diary, which he published and named it &quot;From Tears to Cheers2, in reference to his tears at Cheltenham.;;

The following two seasons once again saw Humphreys as an ever-present in the Hartlepool side under new manager Neale Cooper. In the 2003-04 in English football|2003&amp;ndash;04 season, Hartlepool once again made the play-offs, only to go out after conceding two last minute goals to Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City, a memory which Humphreys described as more painful than Cheltenham.;; Due to the injuries of Micky Barron, Humphreys began regularly captaining the side.;;

In the 2004-05 in English football|2004&amp;ndash;05 season, Humphreys helped Hartlepool once again make the play-offs. During the play-off semi-final against Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere, Humphreys had the task of taking a penalty for Hartlepool in Sudden_death_%28sport%29#Football_.28soccer.29|sudden death. This was the first time Humphreys had taken a penalty since his crucial miss at Cheltenham. This time he scored and sent Hartlepool through to the Play-Off final against his old club Sheffield Wednesday.;; This helped to erase the memories of Cheltenham.;; However, Hartlepool lost the play-off final to Sheffield Wednesday. Humphreys believes that of all the play-off defeats he has suffered that the controversial loss to Wednesday was the hardest to take.;; Before the end of the season Humphreys extended his contract by a further two years.;; 

The following season, 2005-06 in English football|2005&amp;ndash;06, saw Humphreys become the first player to make 200 consecutive league appearances for Hartlepool.;; For this season Humphreys' moved to left back due to Hugh Robertson being injured. Unfortunately Hartlepool and Humphreys suffered relegation. Despite this Humphreys was named theSupporters and Players' Player of the Season as well as the North East Football Awards Football League Player of the Season.;; 

For the 2006-07 in English football|2006&amp;ndash;07 season, Danny Wilson was appointed the new manager, Wilson had previously managed Humphreys at Sheffield Wednesday. On 22 August 2006, Humphreys was dropped for Hartlepool’s match against Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United. After making 230 consecutive appearances, this was the first time Humphreys had not played since October 2001. Shortly after that match, Humphreys joined Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale on a month's loan.;; This was the third time that Danny Wilson had loaned Humphreys out during his career, the only times Humphreys had ever been loaned out. Port Vale tried to extend Humphreys' loan deal by at least another month,;; but Hartlepool refused and Humphreys returned. Humphreys later stated that he had no intentions of leaving Hartlepool.;; 

After a bad start to the season, Hartlepool were struggling near the lower reaches of the table. However, this changed against Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley when Humphreys scored a spectacular last minute winner.;; This sent Hartlepool on 23 match unbeaten streak. During that streak, Humphreys scored another spectacular goal against Walsall F.C.|Walsall to give Hartlepool the lead in a victory that sent them into second place.;; Hartlepool would remain in the top two for the remainder of the season and secured promotion, narrowly missing out on the title. Humphreys performances earned him a place in the League Two PFA Team of the Year.;; Humphreys was also awarded the Monkey Business Achievement Award for this contribution to the season.;; However these awards proved small in comparison to when Humphreys was honoured by the Queen for making a &quot;significant contribution to local and national life&quot; earlier on in the season.;;
