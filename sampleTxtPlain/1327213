Discontinued players
= NOMAD Jukebox Zen series=
NOMAD Jukebox Zen players feature easily replaceable batteries

The first models branded as a &quot;Zen&quot; were then released under the now-defunct NOMAD line, and have an anodized aluminium case. The 2.5-inch Fujitsu hard drives range from a 20 (NOMAD Jukebox Zen), 30 (Zen NX, Zen Xtra), 40 and 60&amp;nbsp;GB (Xtra). Unlike the earlier NOMAD Jukebox players, which looked like CD players, these ones have the appearance of a cassette player.

NOMAD Jukebox Zen
Announced on October 14, 2002, the NOMAD Jukebox Zen was the first player to include the &quot;Zen&quot; branding. It had the ability to connect via USB 1.1 or FireWire, while subsequent releases had connectivity to USB 2.0. Up to 14 hours of continuous audio playback is achieved by the rechargeable battery, and an optional wired remote gives the player an FM tuner and microphone.

NOMAD Jukebox Zen NX
The Zen NX, as it was later called, was released on August 20, 2003,;[http://reviews.cnet.com/mp3-players/creative-nomad-jukebox-zen/4505-6490_7-30468951.html]; is an upgrade to the old NOMAD Jukebox Zen, with a removable battery and a slightly smaller size. Included with the player was MediaSource, the music management software that would be used with subsequent Zen players.
NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra

NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra
The NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra, or the Zen Xtra (renamed by Creative for commercial reasons) was released simultaneously with the Zen NX.;[http://reviews.cnet.com/mp3-players/creative-nomad-jukebox-zen/4505-6490_7-30571468.html]; The player was presumably named Xtra, thanks to the larger screen. The package includes the player, a leather case with belt-clip, a lithium ion battery, a USB cable, and a pair of standard earbuds. Complaints against the Xtra have included failures of the firmware, headphone jack, and the hard drive. The Xtra can have problems with keeping track of very large numbers of music files.;; The equalizer is somewhat broken in at least one firmware version.;;, and is slightly larger than the ZEN Micro with a 20&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive capacity. The ZEN, however, has a magnesium back-casing and the battery is unremovable. This model was initially available in the Asia-Pacific region, but soon became available in the US through Cambridge SoundWorks, a subsidiary of Creative.
ZEN Neeon

= ZEN Neeon=
The ZEN Neeon was released on May 17, 2005.;[http://www.dealtime.co.uk/xPF-Creative-Labs-Zen-NEEON-5-GB]; It is a throwback to the old Zen Xtra, but in a much smaller size. The 5&amp;nbsp;GB model has an Signal-to-noise ratio|SNR of 98 dB and a battery life of 16 hours (19 hours with new firmware version). The front has a piano black finish, and the back is anodized aluminium that comes in ten colors. and the LCD screen has a 7 color backlight.

The Creative ZEN Neeon was criticized highly at the time of release for having a slow interface, more specifically slow start-up, menus and song switch. As well, the first released models came with a virus that could infect your computer.;[http://news.com.com/Virus-infected+Creative+Zen+MP3+players+found/2100-7349_3-5845499.html Virus-infected Creative ZEN MP3 Players found]CNet News.com - September 1, 2005; This affected the popularity of the product and though the hardware and style of the ZEN Neeon was very good, the software seemed to let the product down. The firmware update released latter provided a much quicker start-up time and interface. If released with the player, it might have been more popular on the market.

Like its Micro brother, this unit also has an FM tuner and a microphone, but also has a line in record function. This model does not use Creative specialized USB drivers; it is a standard USB mass storage device.

On November 17, 2005, the microdrive player was updated to 6&amp;nbsp;GB and a new flash range was launched in capacities of 512&amp;nbsp;MB, 1&amp;nbsp;GB, and 2&amp;nbsp;GB.;[http://creative.com/press/releases/welcome.asp?pid=12260]; The device is now equipped with a dual-tone Organic light-emitting diode|OLED screen.

To fix the lack of bass with the ZEN Micro, Creative also implemented a Bass Boost feature, now available in most subsequent players. The 8&amp;nbsp;GB player is available in the same colors of the Micro and is advertised to store &quot;thousands of JPEGs&quot; or &quot;4,000 songs&quot;. Due to its larger battery, the player can play up to 15 hours of continuous playback, 3 hours longer than its predecessor.;; Unlike the Micro, it does not have any problems with the headphone jack. The MicroPhoto is the first of many subsequent players with expanded customization, with the ability to use a picture as a custom wallpaper, with color themes to change the tones of it, and six color schemes.

The player was first announced at the Consumer Electronics Show#2005|2005 Consumer Electronics Show, where it won the G4TV Best of CES award in the Audio To Go category.; On November 2005, the player was the CNET Editor's Choice award on CNET.com.

There are some features of the ZEN Vision which require compatibility with certain operating systems, e.g require users to have access to Microsoft Windows XP (SP1 or higher).

Hardware
Most models are built with Texas Instruments's TMS320DA25xARM architecture and digital signal processor that makes up the CPU. The peripheral circuits take care of all media decoding without any accelerator chips. The touchpads are managed by Synaptics controllers.

The newer Creative ZEN#ZEN|ZEN players uses SigmaTel's STMP3700 ARM, described to be &quot;designed specifically for portable devices&quot;.;; The operating system used is Nucleus RTOS.;;

Marketing campaign
In November 2004, Creative Labs announced a $100 million marketing campaign to promote their digital audio products, including the ZEN range of MP3 players. In particular, the company was heavily publicizing the Zen Touch and ZEN Micro. These two products had been featured in an increasing number of television commercials, print ads, and urban billboards.

Many celebrities were seen with the ZEN Micro, including Paris Hilton, pop group Maroon 5 and Aerosmith's Steven Tyler.

Legal issues
Creative Labs, the American subsidiary of Creative Technology, was awarded a patent on a music management interface (now commonly seen on audio players, including the Apple Inc.|Apple iPod) by the US Patent and Trademark Office on August 25, 2005;;, after applying for it on January 5, 2001.;; Apple filed for a similar patent on October 22, 2002 but was rejected.;; Along with the launch of the Vision:M, Creative announced that it will &quot;aggressively pursue&quot; respect of its patents, addressing &quot;all manufacturers that use the same navigation system.&quot;;; So far, Creative has only addressed Apple's infringement of its patent. Creative announced on May 15, 2006, that it has launched a lawsuit against Apple for the infringement of the ZEN patent;; (Creative also asked the US Trade Commission to investigate whether Apple was breaching trade laws by importing iPods into the US.;;), which was then counter-sued by Apple on the same day, filing two lawsuits for infringing ''their'' patents.;; Since then, Apple and Creative have reached a settlement, with Apple paying $100 million, and Creative joining the &quot;Made for iPod&quot; accessory program.;;
