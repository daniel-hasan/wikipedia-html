Madness is a British pop/ska band from Camden Town, London, that formed in 1976.;Retrieved on June 5, 2007.; As of 2007, the band has continued to perform with their most recognised lineup of seven members, although their lineup has varied slightly over the years. They were one of the most prominent bands of the late-1970s 2 Tone ska revival.; Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.Retrieved on June 19, 2007.; ;

Madness achieved most of their success in the 1980s.Both Madness and UB40 spent exactly 214 weeks on the UK singles charts over the course of the decade, holding the record for most weeks spent by a group in the 1980s UK singles charts.However, Madness achieved this in a a shorter time period (1980-1986).;Rice 1990. p286;;For Madness, the figure of 214 weeks does not include the 4 weeks on the charts by spin-off band &quot;The Madness&quot;.For UB40, the 214 weeks does not include the 8 weeks spent on the charts by &quot;Reckless&quot;, credited to &quot;Afrikaa Bambaataa and Family with UB40&quot;.;;Retrieved on June 10, 2007.;

Career
=1976–1978: Formation=
The core of the band formed as The North London Invaders in 1976 (although their name was often shortened to The Invaders), and included Mike Barson (Monsieur Barso) on keyboards and vocals, Chris Foreman (Chrissy Boy) on guitar and Lee Thompson (Kix) on saxophone and vocals.; They later recruited John Hasler on drums and Cathal Smyth (better known as Chas Smash) on bass guitar. Later in the year, they were joined by lead vocalist &quot;Dikron&quot;.;

rightThis six-piece lineup lasted until part way through 1977, when Graham McPherson (better known as Suggs) took over the lead vocals after seeing the band perform in a friend's garden.;Retrieved on June 5, 2007.; Smyth, who was poor on bass guitar, was replaced by Gavin Rogers, an acquaintance of Barson.; McPherson was kicked out of the band for too often choosing to watch football instead of rehearsing.;Retrieved on June 5, 2007.; Thompson left the band after Barson criticised his saxophone playing.; 

By 1978, the band had allowed McPherson to return, after filling in temporarily for Hasler (who had taken over vocals when McPherson was removed).; Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson, and Daniel Woodgate (Woody) and Mark Bedford (Bedders) also joined the band, on drums, replacing Garry Dovey, and bass guitar, replacing Gavin Rogers, respectively.; After briefly changing their name to Morris and the Minors, the band renamed itself as Madness; paying homage to one of their favourite songs by ska/reggae artist Prince Buster.;Retrieved on June 5, 2007.; The band remained a sextet until late 1979, when Chas Smash rejoined and officially became the seventh member of Madness as a backing vocalist and trumpet player.;

=1979–1981: Early success=







In 1979, the band recorded the Lee Thompson composition &quot;The Prince&quot;.; The song, like the band's name, paid homage to their idol, Prince Buster. The song was released through 2 Tone Records, the label of The Specials founder Jerry Dammers.; The song was a surprise hit, peaking in the UK music charts at number 16.; A performance of &quot;The Prince&quot; on popular UK music show ''Top of the Pops'' helped Madness gain public recognition. Madness then toured with fellow 2 Tone bands The Specials and The Selecter, before recording their debut album, ''One Step Beyond...'', which was released by Stiff Records.; The album included a re-recording of &quot;The Prince&quot; and the band's second and third singles: &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; and &quot;My Girl&quot;. The title song was a cover of the B-side of the 1960s Prince Buster hit &quot;Al Capone&quot;. ''One Step Beyond...'' stayed in the British charts for 37 weeks, peaking at number 2.;Retrieved on July 30, 2007.;; After the release of &quot;My Girl&quot;, the band felt that they had exhausted the material from ''One Step Beyond...'', and did not want to release any more singles from the album.; However, Dave Robinson, head of Stiff Records, disagreed.; Eventually, a compromise was made, and the band decided to release an EP featuring one album track and three new tracks.; The result was the ''Work Rest and Play'' EP, which was headlined by the song &quot;Night Boat to Cairo&quot;, from the ''One Step Beyond'' album.; The EP reached number 6 in the UK singles chart.;
 
The following year, the band's second album, ''Absolutely'' reached number 2 in the UK album charts.;Retrieved on June 19, 2007.; ''Absolutely'' spawned some of the band's biggest hits, most notably &quot;Baggy Trousers&quot;, which peaked at number 3 in the UK singles chart.; &quot;Embarrassment&quot; reached number 4 in the charts, and the instrumental song &quot;Return of the Los Palmas 7&quot; climbed to number 7.; Although the album reviews were generally less enthusiastic than those of ''One Step Beyond...'', they were mostly positive. Robert Christgau gave the album a favorable B- grade,; Christgau, Robert.Retrieved on August 1, 2007.; but Rolling Stone Magazine awarded the album just one out of five stars.; Marcus, Greil.Retrieved on August 1, 2007.; Rolling Stone was particularly scathing of the ska revival in general, stating that &quot;''The Specials'' wasn't very good&quot; and Madness were simply &quot;the Blues Brothers with English accents&quot;.;

=1982–1984: Change of direction=




In 1981, the band's third studio album, ''7'' reached number 5 in the UK album charts and contained three hit singles.;Retrieved on June 19, 2007.; In an article in 1979, Chris Foreman explained that the band's music would move with the times, and change styles as time goes on.; (The full article was also included on the back cover of the ''Absolutely'' LP.); This was shown to be the case, as unlike the two ska-filled, fast-paced albums that preceded it, ''7'' was somewhat of a change in direction. Suggs' vocal performance changed significantly, and his strong Cockney accent from the previous albums had been watered down. The album strayed from the ska-influenced sound of ''One Step Beyond...'' and ''Absolutely'', and moved towards a more conventional and mature pop sound; a trend that continued with subsequent albums. Near the end of 1981, Madness released one of their most recognised songs; a remake of Labi Siffre's 1971 hit &quot;It Must Be Love&quot;.; The song climbed to number 4 in the UK, and in 1983, the song peaked at number 33 in the UScharts.;;Retrieved on June 19, 2007.; In 1982, Madness released their only number 1 hit to date, &quot;House of Fun&quot;; as well as their fourth studio album ''The Rise &amp; Fall''.;Retrieved on June 19, 2007.; The album was well received in the UK, but didn't get an American release. Instead, many of the albums songs were included on the US compilation ''Madness'', including &quot;Our House&quot;, which was their most internationally successful single to date. &quot;Our House&quot; reached number 5 in the UK music charts and number 7 in the US charts.;;Retrieved on June 19, 2007.; Many reviewers compared the ''The Rise &amp; Fall'' to The Kinks' ''Village Green Preservation Society'',; Woodstra, Chris.Retrieved on August 2, 2007.; and it is at times retrospectively considered a concept album. The album also featured &quot;Primrose Hill&quot;, which was more similar to The Beatles song &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, containing similar psychedelic imagery and a layered arrangement.; Mason, Stewart.Retrieved on August 2, 2007.;

In 1983, their single &quot;Wings of a Dove&quot; peaked at number 2 in the UK charts.;Retrieved on June 19, 2007.; Their following album, ''Keep Moving'', peaked at number 6 in the UK album charts, and several singles from that album reached the top 20 in the UK music charts.;Retrieved on June 19, 2007.; The album received some good reviews, with Rolling Stone Magazine giving the album four out of five stars, applauding the band's changing sound.; Puterbraugh, Parke. Retrieved on August 1, 2007.; This review was a vast improvement on the last album reviewed by the magazine, ''Absolutely'', which was heavily criticised.;

=1985–1988: Decline and breakup=
The ''Keep Moving'' album was Mike Barson's last contribution to the band, until their subsequent reunion.In October 1983, the band's founder, keyboardist and prominent songwriter Mike Barson decided to leave the band, partly because he had relocated to Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Retrieved on June 5, 2007.;He officially left the band in June 1984, following the release of &quot;One Better Day&quot;.;Retrieved on June 5, 2007, however finished live performance with the band in 1983,Paul Carrack took Barson's place whilst the band toured America in early 1984. .; The six remaining members left Stiff Records and formed their own label, Zarjazz Records, which was sub-label of Virgin Records.; In 1985, the label released the band's sixth album, ''Mad Not Mad''. Barson's keyboard parts were filled by synthesisers and Steve Nieve joined the band to take his place.In later years, frontman Suggs described the production as &quot;polished turd&quot;.; Clayden, Andy. [http://www.hilltop61.freeserve.co.uk/2tone/madness6.html&quot;The Madness Story: Chapter 6&quot;] Retrieved June 6, 2007; The album reached number 16 in the UK charts, which was the band's lowest position on the album charts to date. Despite the poor chart showing, the album was listed as number 55 in NME's ''All Time 100 Albums''.;Retrieved on June 2, 2007.; The singles for the album fared even worse, with &quot;Yesterday's Men&quot; peaking at number 18 in the UK charts. The subsequent singles, &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; and &quot;Sweetest Girl&quot;, failed to make the top 20, which was a first for Madness singles.

Madness then announced plans for a reunion concert, Madstock!, which was held at Finsbury Park, London on August 8 and 9 of that year.;Retrieved on June 5, 2007.; The original lineup reunited, performing together for the first time since Mike Barson left the band in 1984. Over 75,000 fans attended the weekend festival, and during &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;, the crowd danced so much they caused an earth tremor which measured over 4.5 on the Richter scale.; Radford, Tim.Retrieved on June 3, 2007.;; A subsequent live album was released, and the associated single, &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; (a cover of Jimmy Cliff's 1973 song) reached number 44 in the UK, with the album reaching number 22.;Retrieved on August 1, 2007.;

Madness performing as The Dangermen at Melkweg in Amsterdam in 2005.In 2004, the band played a series of low-key concerts as The Dangermen, performing covers of classic reggae and ska songs.

Collaborations

Madness collaborated with Elvis Costello in 1983 on a version of their song Tomorrow's (Just Another Day).It was released as a b-side to the single. In later years Mike Barson stated that Costello's 'Watching the Detectives' was the main influence on the song My Girl.For the Wonderful album in 1999,Ian Dury laid down vocals on the track Drip Fed Fred which was released as the last single from the album.Subsequently it was Ian's last recording before his death. Live, Madness have collaborated with artists such as UB40 and Prince Buster, notably at their first Madstock concert.

Lyrical themes
Although Madness were seen by some as somewhat of a humorous band with catchy, bouncy songs,;Woodstra, Chris.Retrieved on July 5, 2007.; they sometimes tackled, what were at the time, controversial issues in their lyrics. &quot;Embarrassment&quot; (from the ''Absolutely'' album) was written by Lee Thompson, and reflected the unfolding turmoil following the news that his teenage sister had become pregnant and was carrying a black man's child.;Duffy, Jonathan.Retrieved on June 5, 2007.; The band discussed animal testing in the song &quot;Tomorrow's Dream&quot;.; Thompson, Lee.Retrieved on June 5, 2007.; The band criticized the National Health Service in &quot;Mrs. Hutchinson&quot;, which told the story of a woman who, after several misdiagnoses and mistreatment, became terminally ill. The story was based on the experiences of Mike Barson's mother.;Barson, Mike.Retrieved on June 5, 2007.; Madness' final single prior to disbanding, &quot;(Waiting For) The Ghost Train&quot;, commented on apartheid in South Africa.;

Skinhead controversy
Early in their career, Madness were linked to skinheads; members of a British working class subculture that the media often stereotyped as racist (although many skinheads, including the original generation, are Anti-racism|anti-racist).;;Retrieved on June 25, 2007.; Not only were Madness, along with other 2 Tone bands, popular with skinheads, but it was said that the band members themselves were associated with the subculture. The band's relationship with the skinheads varied at times.Mike Barson was particularly displeased with the band's skinhead association, often finding it disappointing that so many were present at performances. Prior to becoming a full member of the band, Chas Smash had been involved in fights with skinheads at performances. In one particular incident on November 18, 1979, Madness were supported by &quot;Red Beans and Rice&quot;, who featured a black lead singer, and the band were prevented from completing the performance due to the racist chants from certain members of the skinhead filled audience. Suggs later came on stage to show his displeasure at their behaviour, but this didn't stop much of the audience from Nazi saluting at the end of the show.;

In a 1979 ''NME'' interview, Madness member Chas Smash was quoted as saying &quot;We don't care if people are in the NF as long as they're having a good time.&quot; This added to speculation that Madness was a racist band supporting the National Front, although the band members denied those allegations, and Chas Smash responded to the ''NME'' article in the song &quot;Don't Quote Me On That&quot;.; Eventually, band members denied their skinhead roots, which disappointed much of their skinhead fan base.; Pateman, John.Retrieved on June 5, 2007.;

Awards
The band's first notable musical award came in 1983 when they won an &quot;Ivor Novello Award&quot; for ''Best Song'' for the international hit &quot;Our House&quot;.;; They received another &quot;Ivor Novello Award&quot; 17 years later for an &quot;Outstanding Song Collection&quot;.;;Retrieved on June 19, 2007.; In 2005, they were awarded the Mojo Magazine &quot;Hall Of Fame&quot; award, notably for being 'an artist's artist'.;Retrieved on June 10, 2007.;As of 2007, a campaign is taking place by fans of Madness for the band to be awarded a Brit award.;Retrieved on June 10, 2007.; Many fans and critics feel they have been overlooked over their past 30 years in the music industry.;
