Gordon O'Connor is married and has two children, both of them are adults. He now lives in Kanata, Ontario where he has lived for over 20 years.

Cabinet Selection

Though somewhat muted by the higher profile issues in the naming of David Emerson and Michael Fortier to the cabinet, the posting of O'Connor to the position of Minister of National Defence by Prime Minister Harper was met with controversy.Harkening back to ethics and accountability issues including a promised crackdown on lobbying and reforms to lobbying legislation;[http://www.conservative.ca/media/20060113-Platform.pdf Stand up for accountability &amp;ndash; federal election platform 2006], (pdf). Conservative Party of Canada. Retrieved on 2007-08-23.; that Harper raised during the 2006 federal election, O'Connor's employment as a lobbyist for several major defence industry companies including some of the world's largest military contractors, such as General Dynamics, BAE Systems and Airbus as recently as 2004 was seen by many as peculiar. Some feared that with the posting the minister would often be dealing with the very companies for whom he advised for and assisted in soliciting defence contracts; seemingly putting him in constant peril of conflict-of-interest issues.;Adam Day, [http://www.legionmagazine.com/features/militarymatters/06-09.asp &quot;Gordon O'Connor: Minister of National Defence&quot;], ''Legion Magazine,'' September/October 2006. Retrieved on 2007-08-23.; 
However, the aim of the Accountability Act is to prevent people from moving from government to lobbying, and not the opposite as was the case with O'Connor (at least not this time, although in the past he went from General of the Canadian Forces to lobbyist)

There were potential conflict-of-interest issues early in his term as one of the first major issues the Conservatives pledged they would sort out is the replacement of the Forces 'tactical airlift' fleet. One of the most prominent companies bidding for the contract to replace the present fleet of C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules Turboprops is Airbus S.A.S. for whom O'Connor worked as a lobbyist until February 2004, lobbying the former Liberal government to purchase the airplane that would become the Airbus A400M for its tactical airlift fleet.;Romeo St. Martin, [http://www.politicswatch.com/defence-june27-2006.htm &quot;Military spending puts spotlight on O'Connor&quot;], ''PoliticsWatch,'' 27 June 2006.

Tenure As Minister Of Defence
As soon as Gordon O'Connor became Minister of National Defence, the Canadian Government decided to purchase 4 C-17 Globemaster IIIs, manufactured by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems for $3.4 billion,;[http://www.dnd.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1971 DND/CF News Release], 29 June 2006, Retrieved on 2007-08-23; 16 CH-47 Chinook medium lift helicopters, also from Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, for $4.7 billion,;[http://www.dnd.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1966 DND/CF News Release], 28 June 2006, Retrieved on 2007-08-23; 17 C-130Js from Lockheed-Martin for $4.9 billion,;[http://www.dnd.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1971 DND/CF News Release], 29 June 2006, Retrieved on 2007-08-23; 2300 Medium-Sized Logistics Trucks for $1.1 billion,;[http://www.dnd.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1962 DND/CF News Release], 27 June 2006, Retrieved on 2007-08-23; and $2.9 billion for 3 Joint Support Ships,;[http://www.dnd.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1959 DND/CF News Release], 26 June 2006, Retrieved on 2007-08-23; for a total of $17 billion.

O'Connor announced on May 30, 2006 that the Canadian Forces would be suspending usage of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class|Mercedes G-Wagon combat vehicle to on-base operations only, after a number of Canadian soldiers were killed while travelling in the lightly-armoured vehicle. However, three months later it was revealed that no such order was ever given, and the controversial vehicles were still being used in combat operations.;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060813/afghanistan_gwagons_0600813 &quot;O'Connor misspoke on G-wagons: gov't records&quot;], Canadian Press, 14 August 2006.

Controversy
=Afghanistan=



In May 2005, as Canada's policy of detaining people in Afghanistan and transferring them to units of the Afghan police known for torture, O'Connor told Parliament that the International Committee of the Red Cross: &quot;The Red Cross or the Red Crescent is responsible to supervise their treatment once the prisoners are in the hands of the Afghan authorities. If there is something wrong with their treatment, the Red Cross or Red Crescent would inform us and we would take action.&quot;

This statement was later denied by the ICRC, which stated that it was &quot;informed of the agreement, but ... not a party to it and ... not monitoring the implementation of it.&quot;The ICRC also advised that, in accordance with its normal operating procedure, it would not notify any foreign government (Canada included) of abuse found in Afghan prisons.;Paul Koring, [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070308.wdetainees07/BNStory/National/home &quot;Red Cross contradicts Ottawa on detainees&quot;], ''The Globe and Mail,'' 8 March 2007. Retrieved on 2007-08-23.;

On March 13, O'Connor travelled to Kandahar to meet with Abdul Noorzai of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, &quot;look the man in the eyes&quot;, and gain assurances that detainees were being supervised.;Joe Friesen, [http://www.afghanistannewscenter.com/news/2007/march/mar152007.html &quot;O'Connor meets with Afghan rights chief&quot;], ''The Globe and Mail,'' 15 March 2007. Retrieved on 2007-08-23.;

O'Connor subsequently acknowledged in an [http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=2217 official release] that his statement in Parliament was not true, and that the ICRC was not monitoring detainees and not informing Canada as he claimed.;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/03/19/afghanaplogy.html &quot;O'Connor sorry for misinforming House on Afghan detainees&quot;], CBC News, 19 March 2007. Retrieved on 2007-04-27.;

Additional controversy was generated in the week of April 23 when ''The Globe and Mail'' reported that 30 Afghan men formerly under Canadian custody alleged they had been tortured by their Afghan captors.;Graeme Smith,[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070423.wdetainee23/BNStory/International &quot;From Canadian custody into cruel hands&quot;], ''The Globe and Mail,'' 23 April 2007. Retrieved on 2007-08-22.; Two days later, another ''Globe'' story ran on a government report from which &quot;negative references to acts such as torture, abuse, and extra judicial killings were blacked out without an explanation.&quot;;Paul Koring, [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070425.DETAINEE25/TPStory/National &quot;What Ottawa doesn't want you to know&quot;], ''The Globe and Mail'' (subscription required), 25 April 2007.

Retrieved on 2007-08-23.; The difficulties faced by O'Connor were exacerbated after various government ministers and Stephen Harper himself gave apparently conflicting testimony on the existence and nature of the agreement with Afghan forces to supervise detainees.;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070425/afghanistan_abuse_070426 &quot;Cdns. have had access to detainees all along: Day&quot;], CTV News, 26 April 2007. Retrieved on 2007-08-23.;

Following these revelations, the opposition parties unanimously demanded O'Connor's resignation; a demand echoed by some press commentators such as Andrew Coyne. Stephen Harper has resisted all calls for O'Connor's dismissal.;Daniel LeBlanc, [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070425.wdetaineesreax25/BNStory/Afghanistan &quot;Harper stands by O'Connor as furor grows&quot;], ''The Globe and Mail'' (subscription required), 25 April 2007. Retrieved on 2007-08-23.;

An anonymous Conservative source was quoted as saying that despite losing Harper's confidence, O'Connor would not be dismissed lest his removal send the wrong message: &quot;If it's interpreted as us wavering, or any weakening of resolve that somehow we're on the wrong course, those questions would get asked... The Taliban would see it as a positive thing.&quot;;Brian Laghi, [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070426.DETAINEEANALYSIS26/TPStory &quot;PM stands by O'Connor &amp;ndash; but for the wrong reasons&quot;], ''The Globe and Mail'' (subscription required), 26 April 2007.
