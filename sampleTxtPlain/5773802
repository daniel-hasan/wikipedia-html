Patellar Tendon Rupture is an injury occouring in the knee.

=The Patella Tendon=

;

The patellar tendon attaches to the tibial tubercle on the front of the tibia just below the front of the knee, and is connected to the bottom of the patella, above which are attached to the quadriceps tendon, followed by the quadriceps muscle, large muscles on the front of the thigh. This structure allows the knee to flex and extend, allowing use of basic functions such as walking, running, etc.

=Rupture=

When rupture occours, the patella loses support from the tibia and moves toward the hip when the quadriceps muscle contract, hindering the leg's ability to extend. This means that those affected cannot stand, as their knee buckles and gives way when they attempt to.

=Diagnosis=

Through X-Ray scans, Patellar Tendon Rupture is diagnosed by recognising that the patella has moved upward along the thigh.

=Treatment=

Patellar Tendon Rupture must be treated through surgery.

Surgery

An incision is made in the skin over the rupture, the site of which is identified. The tendons are retracted so surgeons may inspect the femur. The tendon ends are then sewn together.

A cast or brace is then put over where the operation took place. The cast or brace remains for at least 6 weeks followed by an unidentified time of Physical_therapy|rehabilitation of the knee.

=Side Effects=

The usual risks of surgery are involved including: infection, stiffness, suture reaction, failure of satisfactory healing, risks of anesthesia, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, and persistent pain or weakness after the injury and repair.
