The Fokker F24 was a pre-war passenger airliner design by the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, Fokker.

History
Due to the success of Douglas' Douglas DC-3|DC-3, Fokker's role in the global market for passenger aircraft was severely diminished.Whereas KLM was historically an important customer to Fokker, even they turned to other suppliers.When in 1938 KLM ordered the Douglas DC-5 in the USA and showed interest in the Douglas DC-4|DC-4C, Fokker realised it had to come to terms with the new era. 

In an attempt to revive the glory days, Fokker finally adopted an all-metal approach with a new design, dubbed Model 193.Intended to replace the obsolete and outdated F22 and F36 models, Fokker had to use new technologies instead of designs based on wooden wings and few metal parts in the fuselage.Later on this model became known as the F24.

Whereas KLM was state-owned, Fokker used its political influence to force a sale from KLM.Finally in October 1939, KLM ordered four F24s.This sale was part of a broader package which also comprised of the Douglas DC-4C, the Lockheed 44 Excalibur and another Fokker design known as Model 180.

The F24 as it was proposed, was a short-range all-metal twin-engine passenger aircraft.It was supposed to be powered by two Wright Cyclone radial engines of 1600 hp each.Its fuselage was designed for 26 passengers.The single aisle cabin layout had eight rows of two abreast on the right and eight rows of a single seat on the left.A cargo bay was put between the passenger cabin and the cockpit.This cockpit had a layout for a crew of four.In the middle of the passenger cabin was a galley.At the aft side of the cabin was a toilet with another cargo bay.

Although KLM ordered four aircraft, the project never materialised as World War II broke out.During the war, design work was continued.After the war, Fokker could not deliver the planes on short notice as its factories were largely destroyed.Subsequently KLM turned to American suppliers like Convair and Douglas.The F24 design attracted no other airlines and the project ended as Fokker turned to more modern designs.

Retrospect
In retrospect the F24 was a direct predecessor of the Fokker F27 Friendship built from the 1950s on.Its basic design layout was similar with the engine type as the main difference as the F27 had turboprops whereas the F24 was designed to have radial engines.The F27 also was considerably larger.
