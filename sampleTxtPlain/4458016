The 5th Avenue Theatre is a landmark theatre located in Seattle, Washington, USA.It has hosted a variety of theatre productions and motion pictures since it opened in 1926.It is operated as a venue for nationally touring Broadway and original shows by the non-profit organization|non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre Association.;;The theatre, located at 1308 Fifth Avenue in the historic Skinner Building, has been listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places since 1978.;;

The 2,130 seat theatre is the resident home to the 5th Avenue Musical Theatre Company and employs over 600 actors, musicians, directors, choreographers, designers, technicians, stage hands, box office staff, and administrators, making it the largest theatre employer in the Puget Sound region.;;;Unique in the region, the theatre company survives almost exclusively on gate receipts, without subsidy.;; 

Architecture
Image:5th Ave Theater Entry (Seattle) 2007-08.jpg|thumb|right|Entry to theatre with decorative brackets above
Located in the Skinner Building, an historic office block ranging from five to eight stories with retail shops on the ground level, the theatre is surrounded on three sides, with its entry facing its namesake avenue.In addition to an auditorium with an original seating capacity of 3,000, thetheatre contains a grand entry hall, and a mezzanine that once featured a tea room in addition to a waiting room and women's lounge.;; 

The interior design of the 5th Avenue Theatre was modeled to reproduce some of the features of the most historic and well-known Beijing landmarks.The Norwegian artist Gustav Liljestrom executed the design based on his visit to China and the illustrated account of Ernst Boerschmann's travels there, ''Chinesische Architecktur'', published in 1925.;;

The ornate historical Chinese style of the theatre distinguishes itself from the Neo-Renaissance exterior of the Skinner Building.Only at the street entry under the marquee does the viewer get a preview of the interior design.Here, adorning the ceiling are plaster representations of wood brackets, beams, and carved reliefs painted in a wikt:polychromatic|polychromatic scheme and decorated with stenciled dragons and flower patterns.Carved cloud shapes screen light fixtures to create an indirect lighting effect as the viewer approaches the wooden, brass knobbed entry doors.The original central free-standing box office was replaced by the current box office located to the side of the entry as part of a 1979 renovation.;The original Imperial guardian lions (''Ruì Shī''), commonly called foo dogs or foo lions, originally located outside the entry were moved inside as part of the 1979 renovation. 

Image:5th Ave Theater FooDog (Seattle) 2007-08.jpg|thumb|100px|left| Male Imperial guardian lion.The interior architecture of the theatre is an &quot;excellent imitation of Chinese wooden temple construction&quot;.;The two story rectangular lobby features red, stenciled columns wrapped in plaster rising to a timbered roof structure of decoratively painted beams supporting a canopy of bamboo, also imitated in plaster.The original pair of guardian lions, both male, guard the stairway to a second level gallery that serves the theatre balcony.In addition to the Imperial guard lions, other original furnishings, light fixtures, and decoration remain intact.

The decorative details continue in the 2,130-seat auditorium, but the highlight and focal decorative feature is the octagonal caisson from which a sculpted five-toed Imperial Chinese dragon springs.A large chandelier of glass hangs from the dragon's mouth, in reference to the Chinese symbol of a dragon disgorging flaming pearls.;;One claim puts the size of this caisson at twice the size of the model on which it was based in the throne room of the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the Forbidden City.;The opening night program spoke effusively of it:

;... Its most imposing feature is the great dome...its symbolic themes borrowed from Chinese legends, its motifs from Chinese poetry.Coiled within an azure sphere and surrounded by glowing hues of cloud red, emblematic of calamity and welfare; blue of rain; green symbolic of plaque; black of flood; and gold of prosperity--is the Great Dragon, guardian genius of the place, his presence shadowed and multiplied in varying forms throughout the structure.On the huge beams surrounding and supporting the dome are five-clawed dragons--the Emperor's emblem--spitting fire in pursuit of the Jewel, rendered in the shape of a disc emitting effulgent rays, and symbolic of Omnipotence.;;

The dragon motif is repeated in the radial coffers of the caisson and the timbered coffers throughout the theatre.The Imperial dragon is accompanied by the symbol of the Empress, the Chinese phoenix ''(Fèng huáng)'', sometimes called Ho-Ho or Ho-Oh Bird from the Japanese.This personal symbol of the Empress is also repeated throughout the theatre, but most prominently in relief as part of the grills above false balconies that once screened organ pipes.In addition to these symbols, orange blossoms, chrysanthemums, and lotus flowers appear throughout the theatre.The highly decorated proscenium arch and safety curtain maintain the Chinese design influence.;

Beyond the decorative features of the building, the 5th Avenue Theatre also contained notable technical features when originally built.An ascending orchestra pit and independent Wurlitzer organ platform allowed the musicians to be raised up to main stage height or to orchestra pit level from the basement below.;; The ventilation system had thermostatic controls throughout the building, and allowed the air to be 'washed' prior to its introduction into the venue at outlets under every third seat.;

History
= Planning and construction=
The president and general manager of Pacific Northwest Theatres, Inc., Harry C. Arthur, believed Seattle to be a place of growing importance in the motion picture industry in the mid-1920s, and consequently as the place to invest for the long term.;;Arthur's company absorbed a competing chain of 40 theatres by 1926, and sought further expansion.A large holder of the theatre company's stock and debt was C. D. Stimson who sat on the board of directors of both Pacific Northwest Theatres and the Metropolitan Building Company, developer of what became known as the Metropolitan Tract.Stimson promoted the establishment of a theatre district like that which had developed around a theatre he had built in Los Angeles, California.;; The planned Skinner Buildingwith a theatre owned by Arthur's company would complete the Stimson development of the Metropolitan Tract.;;

The architect, Robert Reamer, had joined the Metropolitan Building Company after World War I and as their house architect designed the Skinner Building and the 5th Avenue Theatre.;;;In creating the 5th Avenue Theatre, Reamer was joined by his colleague, Joseph Skoog, of Reamer's office and Gustav Liljestrom, of the S. &amp; G. Gump Company of San Francisco.;

Construction began in October of 1925 with construction taking 11 months.;

=Grand opening=
Image:5th Ave Theater Grand Opening (Seattle) 1926-09.jpg|thumb|right| Opening night.The theatre celebrated its grand opening on September 24, 1926 with an opening unit program that included both film and live vaudeville performances.;;The opening program included the silent film ''Young April'', Fanchon and Marco's stage presentation ''The Night Club'', and Lipschultz and his Syncopated Soloists.;;The theatre organist for opening night was Oliver Wallace, a popular local musician and composer, who returned from Portland, Oregon where he played at the Broadway Theatre to play accompaniment.Wallace had been the first theatre organist in a Seattle motion picture house.;;

Opening night was also marked by festivities outside the theatre.Seven blocks of downtown Seattle around the theatre were closed to street car and automobile traffic.Lured by free street car, bus, and taxicab rides, thousands of people packed Fifth Avenue between Seneca Street and Pike Street, University and Union Streets.The Seattle Times reported,

;It is doubtful that any Friday night in Seattle's history saw more people circulating through all the downtown streets than were there last night.The density in the center of the activities was such that street cars were diverted...&quot;;;;

In the street outside the theatre a street carnival took place.Spotlights scanned the night sky, flares were shot from the roofs of nearby buildings, dance bands were placed at the closed intersections to provide entertainment, and using giant screens to project the words, a sing-along was orchestrated on Fifth Avenue in front of the theatre.An estimated crowd of between 50,000 and 100,000 people participated in the events.;

= Decline and restoration=
Following the grand opening, the theatre served as a venue for vaudeville and film, and following the decline of vaudeville as a movie palace until the 1970s. Facing severe financial difficulties, it was forced to close its doors in 1978 along with the nearby Orpheum theatre. A variety of re-use possibilities were proposed for the theatre including a Chinese restaurant, a triplex movie theater, an office building, or a shopping center.;;;;;

In 1979, 43 business leaders banded together and underwrote a US$2.6 million loan to save the theatre.

Several changes were made during the renovation.The orchestra pit and auditorium seating were rebuilt, the dressing rooms moved, and the technical systems updated.However, the furniture, fixtures and interior signage were retained. Even the paint was carefully restored to its original luster. 

June 16, 1980 marked the theatre’s rebirth and a new chapter in Seattle’s arts community.The 5th Avenue Theatre continues to thrive with the assistance of many generous donors and volunteers.;;

=Post-1980 history=
Since the renovation, the 5th Avenue Theatre has become one of Seattle's most established theatres. In 1989, The 5th Avenue Musical Theatre Company was established as the resident non-profit theatre company.;; Since 1980, The 5th Avenue Theatre has produced or presented more than 3,000 performances of nearly 100 productions, attended by over 5.5 million people.

Today, The 5th Avenue Theatre produces musical revivals, premieres of Broadway-bound shows, and presents touring Broadway musicals, amounting to approximately 150 live musical theater performances per year.It also hosts a variety of special events, and offers a number of education and outreach programs to school-age children and adults reaching over 55,000 students, professional performers, and audiences each year.The theatre attracts over 200,000 patrons annually;

Significance
Preceding Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, California, the 5th Avenue Theatre &quot;has been called the largest and most authentic example of traditional Chinese timber architecture and decoration outside of Asia.&quot;;In addition, its association with architect Robert Reamer, whose other notable works include the nationally known Old Faithful Inn in Yellowstone National Park, as well as many important buildings in the Art Deco style add to its significance. ;The Fifth Avenue Theatre was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on November 28, 1978.;
