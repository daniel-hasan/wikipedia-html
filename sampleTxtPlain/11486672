Kim Kibum (Hangul: 김기범; Hanja: 金起範; born August 21, 1987 in Seoul, South Korea), also credited as simply Kibum (Hangul: 기범; Hanja: 起範), is an actor and the second youngest member of K-pop boy band Super Junior. 

Background
Kibum was born in Seoul, South Korea but moved to Santa Monica, California, United States when he started high school. It was not until several years later when he was discovered by a talent agent from South Korea and was recommended to audition for the ''Starlight Casting System 2002''. Kibum soon signed under SM Entertainment and became their official trainee, being trained in areas of singing, acting, dancing, and other performing talents.

Career

Kim's first appearance and debut was on April 21, 2004 when he appeared on a Korean television drama ''April Kiss''. A year after, his talent agency announced that Kim would make a second debut as a member of a large all-boy group Super Junior. The group made their official debut on November 6, 2005, in SBS's ''Inkigayo'', performing Super Junior's first single, &quot;TWINS (Knock Out)&quot;. Kim is known for his English rapping ability in the group and remains as one of the lead rappers of Super Junior.

After his debut as a singer, he starred as the first male lead in ''Sharp #2'' in 2005 alongside Go Ah-Ra and fellow Super Junior member Kim Heechul. Later on, he had a minor role in ''Marrying a Millionaire''. He also starred in ''Rainbow Romance'' as the lead actor for 243 episodes along with Kim Heechul. During the fall of 2006, he reunited with Go Ah Ra once again to star in the SBS drama ''Snow Flower''. 

Aside from acting and singing activities, Kim is also seen in advertisements for ''KTF'', ''C&amp;C phone'', ''NF Sonata'', ''OLIVE'', ''My Chew'', ''Ottogi Noddle'' with bandmate Kim Heechul and co-star Go Ah Ra, and ''Elite Uniform'' with his SM senior BoA.
