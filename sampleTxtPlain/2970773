Profile
Huntelaar was born in Drempt, a village in the Achterhoek region of Netherlands, but moved to Hummelo when he was six weeks old.; ; He lived with parents Dirk-Jan and Maud Huntelaar, and his two brothers Niek and Jelle.; Like his two brothers, at the age of five Huntelaar joined the local football team v.v. H. en K. (football club Hummelo and Keppel) where he played for the next six years.; Huntelaar was scouted as a youth talent by Go Ahead Eagles, however, the distance required to travel prohibited him from joining the team from Deventer.; Soon after he was scouted by De Graafschap where on April 6, 1994 he signed his first youth contract, aged eleven.; During his first two years with De Graafschap, Huntelaar played as a left back, a left winger, an attacking midfielder, and even as a goalkeeper; only in his third year was he deployed as a striker.; In the 1997–98 season, the now 14 year old Huntelaar was the first striker for the C-team at De Graafschap, and scored 33 goals in 20 matches.; The following season saw him promoted to the B1 team, and in the 1999–00 season he became top scorer of the B1 league with 31 goals.; His goal-scoring abilities drew the attention of PSV Eindhoven, who signed him in June 2000.;

Huntelaar is a striker who plays as a centre forward, or an &quot;out-and-out&quot; striker, rather than as a supporting striker. He has a good technical ability and can score goals with either foot.; In an October 2007 interview Huntelaar stressed the importance of fitness to his game: ''&quot;You have to work on every area but I would say that physical fitness is absolutely essential, especially in big games. I need to stay sharp and keep my speed up over 90 minutes, from the kick-off right through to the final whistle. That's fundamental.&quot;'';; He has been compared in playing style to Marco van Basten and Fernando Morientes.;;; In January 2001, Huntelaar and his girlfriend Maddy became a couple.;

Career
=PSV=
In his first season at PSV, Huntelaar quickly established himself as a prolific goalscorer for their A1 youth team under coach Willy van der Kuijlen (the all-time top scorer in the Eredivisie with 311 goals), scoring 26 goals in 23 games to become top scorer in the youth league.; In his second season at PSV, Huntelaar was added to Guus Hiddink's senior team, but failed to secure a place in the starting line-up. He made his first team debut as a substitute for Mateja Kežman on November 23, 2002 in a 0–3 away win over RBC Roosendaal. This turned out to be his only Eredivisie appearance for the club.; ;;

=De Graafschap=
Having failed to establish himself in the PSV first team, Huntelaar was sent on loan to his old club De Graafschap. He made his senior debut for De Graafschap on February 8, 2003, coming on as a substitute for Hans van de Haar againstRBC Roosendaal.; ; He made his first appearance in the starting lineup on February 16, 2003 as De Graafschap were beaten 1–5 by his future employer SC Heerenveen.; ; He made his final appearance in the squad on May 29, 2003 as De Graafschap lost 2–1 to FC Zwolle, confirming their demotion from the Eredivisie.; ; In total, Huntelaar made nine Eredivisie appearances for ''the Super Farmers'' but failed to score, and De Graafschap decided not to extend his contract.; ;

=AGOVV=
At the start of the 2003–04 season Huntelaar was again sent on loan, this time to newly-promoted Eerste Divisie side AGOVV Apeldoorn under coach Jurrie Koolhof.; ; He was an instant success, scoring on his debut for AGOVV against TOP Oss.; ; In his second league game for AGOVV, Huntelaar scored a hat-trick against Heracles Almelo.; ; Huntelaar went on to score 26 times in his 35 league appearances and finished the season as the division's top goalscorer, and was named &quot;Player of the Year&quot; for the Eerste Divisie.; ;In 2007, AGOVV named one of the stands at Sportpark Berg &amp; Bos the &quot;Klaas-Jan Huntelaar stand&quot;.; ;

=SC Heerenveen=
After Huntelaar turned down the opportunity to sign a new contract with PSV, Frysian club SC Heerenveen moved in to sign him for a transfer fee of €100,000.; The player has since explained his decision not to renew his contract, saying ''&quot;I was there for two years and when I turned 18 I was loaned out to De Graafschap, where I'd played between the ages of 10 and 16, and then to AgoVV. When I went back to PSV the second time, I wasn't playing and the club didn't offer me anything specific. I just wanted to play and work on my game.&quot;''; Heerenveen chairman Riemer van der Velde described what the club expected from the player: ''&quot;He is a young, scoring striker who has undergone a good development last season. He will have to prove himself on a higher level, but I expect that he can benefit us greatly. If Huntelaar can score fifteen goals like Sibon did last season, we can't complain&quot;.'';Dutch: &quot;Het is een jonge, scorende spits die zich afgelopen seizoen goed heeft ontwikkeld. Hij zal zich op een hoger niveau moeten bewijzen, maar ik verwacht dat we een hoop plezier aan hem kunnen beleven. Als Huntelaar er net als Sibon vorig seizoen vijftien maakt mogen we niet klagen.&quot;; Huntelaar started the 2004-05 in Dutch football|2004–05 season well by scoring on his Eredivisie debut with Heerenveen against AZ.; ; Huntelaar also scored in his second game for Heerenveen, against Roda JC, and less than a month later scored a brace to lead Heerenveen to a 3–0 victory against NAC Breda.; ;; ; In October, Huntelaar scored two more braces, one against FC Utrecht, and one against FC Den Bosch.; ;; ; Huntelaar scored more goals against RBC Roosendaal and Willem II Tilburg to take his scoring tally to 10 goals in 17 games at the winter break.; ;; ; The striker continued to do well after the winter break, scoring in the first two games of 2005 against FC Den Bosch and NAC Breda.; ;; ; However, he could not continue his good start to the new year and hit a scoring drought; Huntelaar did not score in his next eight league games. It was only in late April that he continued his scoring form with a hat-trick against RBC.; ; Huntelaar finished the season in style, scoring in the two penultimate games, against FC Groningen and NEC.; ;; ; At the end of the season, Huntelaar had scored a total of 17 goals in 31 matches, and was a decisive factor in helping Heerenveen qualify for the UEFA Cup. 

Huntelaar was once again on target in the first league game of the Eredivisie 2005/2006|2005–06 season, against Vitesse.; ; Klaas-Jan scored again in his second and fourth game of the season, against Roda JC and Heracles, respectively.; ;; ; In October, Huntelaar scored a hat-trick in an away match against NAC Breda, Heerenveen winning 0–3.; ; November saw the striker score a brace against FC Groningen and the winning goal against Sparta Rotterdam.; ;; ; December, his final month for Heerenveen, would prove to be productive for Huntelaar as the player scored seven goals in four games, includingbraces against Willem II, FC Twente, and RKC Waalwijk.; ;; ;; ; Huntelaar's final game for the Frisian club was against AFC Ajax, his future employer. Huntelaar was again on target as Heerenveen beat Ajax 4–2.; ; By the winter break, he had scored 17 goals in 15 matches, which earned him a mid-season transfer to AFC Ajax. Heerenveen received €9 million plus future incentives for the player.;; A substantial sum went to rivals PSV Eindhoven as a result of a training compensation rule imposed by FIFA.

Celebrating victory in the Dutch Cup with Ajax
After transferring from Heerenveen during the winter break, Huntelaar struggled in his first month with Ajax. It was only in February, in his fifth match for Ajax, that he scored his first goal, in a Gatorade Cup tie against his old club Heerenveen.; ; Once he had broken his scoring drought, Huntelaar started scoring regularly. During the month of February, Huntelaar scored nine goals in seven matches for Ajax, including a header against F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan on his Champions League debut.;; Huntelaar continued his goal-scoring for the rest of the season, and ended as the Dutch league's top scorer, having scored sixteen goals in as many appearances for Ajax, bringing his total for the season to 33 goals in 31 matches.; ;As Ajax finished second in the Dutch league, they needed to win the European play-offs to secure a place in the third round of the Champions League.

=Netherlands national team=
Huntelaar participated in the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship for the Netherlands under coach Louis van Gaal. The striker scored two goals in the tournament before the Dutch were eliminated in the quarter finals by Egypt.;

Huntelaar in 2006.
Huntelaar was part of the preliminary Dutch squad prior to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but was not chosen in the squad for the tournament itself. Coach Marco van Basten explained that he felt Huntelaar would benefit from more experience and from playing at the UEFA U-21 Championship 2006|UEFA Under 21&amp;nbsp;football championships with Foppe de Haan's Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands U21 squad, going as far as to say that it was up to Huntelaar to &quot;show us there that by not selecting Huntelaar we did not do the right thing&quot;.; ; While Holland went on to score just three goals in four games goals at the World Cup in Germany, the youth side did a lot better in the U21 championship. Huntelaar was the top-scorer of the Under 21 tournament with four goals as the young Dutch were victorious in the tournament. He scored a powerful strike in the semi-final against France and a brace in the final against Ukraine.;; Huntelaar was named as one of the strikers in the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship#Player awards|UEFA Team of the Tournament.;;

Huntelaar's status as a rising star was confirmed when Marco van Basten decided to select the striker as his starting striker in the Dutch National squad's friendly against the Republic of Ireland on August 16, 2006. Huntelaar paid immediate dividends in his debut for the senior squad by scoring two goals, and making two assists, in Holland's 4&amp;ndash;0 victory.;; Huntelaar was the fist player to score on his debut for the Dutch national squad since Dick Nanninga did so in 1978.; However in his next seven caps he did not manage to add another goal, and due to the return of Ruud van Nistelrooy to the team and the presence of other strikers like Robin van Persie, Dirk Kuyt, and Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, his chances in the team have been limited. After being left out of the squad for a number of games, he was recalled to the squad in October 2007 for the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying games against Romania and Slovenia.;; Due to the suspension of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Huntelaar was in the starting line-up against Slovenia, scoring his first competitive international goal in a 2&amp;ndash;0 win.;;
