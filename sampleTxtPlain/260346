Neposedi () is a children's music group formed in Moscow, Russia in 1991 by Elena Pindzhoyan and Yuri Nikolaev. The title refers to children who are unable to sit indifferently in the same place; who are fidgety.

Yulia Volkova and Lena Katina of t.A.T.u were the most successful of the group. They were both members from 1997 until 1999. Volkova claims to have been banned for smoking, drinking and swearing ; Neposedi, however, deny this, stating she had graduated as many of the members do at a certain age. Lena (Lena Katina), of t.A.T.u., left Neposedi soon after Volkova. 

The group's first release was in 1997 titled ''Пусть миpом пpaвит любовь'' (Pust' Mirom Pravit Lyubov'; Let love rule the world). The album included 20 tracks, both in English and Russian, with covers of &quot;It's All Coming Back to Me Now&quot; and &quot;Can You Feel The Love Tonight.&quot; In the song &quot;Looking In&quot;, the voice of Lena Katina is prominent, and Volkova has a few lines in the song as well. 

Neposedi is still together today, with ever changing members, performing in Russia. They had a notable performance at the GTSKZ &quot;Russia&quot; on Children's Protection Day. They sang 19 new songs, and after the performance, a CD of these songs was released, including two bonus videos.

In 2006, the group released a CD titled &quot;To Us 15 Years!&quot;, a celebration of the group's 15 year anniversary, including a cover of the song &quot;Irresistible&quot; by Jessica Simpson.
