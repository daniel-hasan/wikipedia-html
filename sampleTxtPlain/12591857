Jangan Gu, established on July 1, 1988, is the northern district of the city of Suwon in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.

Geography
Jangan Gu lies in the north of Suwon. It is bordered by Uiwang to the north-west, Yongin to the north and east, Yeongtong Gu to the south-east, Paldal Gu to the south and Gwonseon Gu to the south west.

Jangan Gu's northern border, with Yongin, is the mountain of Gwanggyosan.At 582 metres above sea level,;http://www.koreasanha.net/san/gwanggyo.htm; this is Suwon's highest point.

Most of the streams passing through Suwon originate in Jangan Gu, on Gwanggyosan or other nearby peaks. Since Suwon is bounded to the east by other hills, the streams, chiefly the Suwoncheon, flow southwards through the city, eventually emptying into the Yellow Sea at Asan Bay. The entirety of Suwon is drained in this manner.
