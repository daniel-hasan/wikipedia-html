Eastwood is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Eastwood is located 17 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government areas of the City of Ryde and the City of Parramatta. Eastwood is also split between the Lower North Shore region and the Hills District.

Originally thought to have been inhabited by the Wallumedegal Aboriginal tribe, who lived in the area between the Lane Cove and Parramatta Rivers, the area was first settled by Europeans shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, from land grants to marines and N.S.W. Corps, and was named &quot;Eastwood&quot; by an early Irish free settler, William Rutledge. Today it is a large urban centre in the north of Sydney of over 14000 people, witha large shopping area. Over the past few decades Eastwood has become increasingly multicultural and has a large Chinese and Korean community. Eastwood is best known as the place of where the Granny Smith Apple was first grown.

Geography
Eastwood is located at the edge of the Hornsby Plateau with the suburbs of Dundas Valley and Denistone on its southern and western sides as the land falls away down to the Cumberland Plain. To the north, Eastwood is bounded by the transport hub of Epping and to its east Marsfield which shares the same postcode of 2122. The suburb is predominantly residential with the main shopping area of Eastwood centred between Rowe Street and Rutledge Street around the railway line.
History
Eastwood was named after the property of Irish free settler, William Rutledge. The area was originally heavily timbered. 
=Aboriginal Culture=
The Wallumedegal Aboriginal tribe lived in the area between the Lane Cove River and Parramatta River, which was known as Walumetta.

=European Settlement=
The area was first settled by Europeans shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788 and was part of the Field of Mars. 

The area of Eastwood was originally granted between the years of 1790 and 1803 to marines of the NSW Corps. John Love, a private was granted 90 acres here in 1794, described as ''North Brush, in the Field of Mars Common''. The land was then acquired by William Kent who already held land in what is now Epping. The land was purchased by William Rutledge for 288 pounds in 1835, who built Eastwood House in 1840. This house is now part of Marist College Eastwood. In 1863 Edward Terry purchased the estate and upon his death in 1905, the estate was sub-divided. 

In 1886, the railway line fromStrathfield to Hornsby was opened, with a station here originally called Dundas. This was changed a year later to Eastwood, named after the Eastwood Estate.

The commercial centre underwent a major upgrade in the early 1980s. Rowe Street, which originally ran across the railway line through a level crossing was turned into a mall between The Avenue and West Parade, and the 1940s bridge built in First Avenue for crossing traffic was replaced with a six-lane bridge. This bridge was to service the planned County of Cumberland Scheme &quot;County Road&quot; (linking Eastwood with Macquarie Park), a road project in the local area which has been controversial among locals.;Laybutt, Sam, ''[http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Special/Unbuilt/Eastwood/eastwoodcountyroad.htm &quot;Ozroads: Eastwood County Road&quot;]'', 2004-2007. Accessed 6 July, 2007.;.

Commercial Area
The Eastwood commercial district is located around Eastwood Railway Station. The Eastwood Shopping Centre is a shopping mall, which includes major retailer Woolworths, is located in the town centre and opens on to the Eastwood Plaza. The Plaza features a fountain and several cafes with outdoor seating. Eastwood is becoming well known as an Asian shopping precinct, with specialty stores, supermarkets and many restaurants run by Chinese, Korean, Sri Lankan, Vietnamese, Greek, Italian and Indian retailers.;Maher, Stephen, &quot;Goodbye to the Eastwood of old&quot;, ''Northern District Times'', 11 April, 2007, p. 14. Accessed via Factiva on 10 July, 2007.; The multicultural background of its residents has created a good collection of Chinese, Korean, Greek, Italian, Vietnamese and Singaporean restaurants and eateries in the area.

Housing
While most of Eastwood is residential, with one or two-storey buildings and villas, the area surrounding the town centre boasts buildings up to seven storeys high. In 2006 the City of Ryde developed a Control Plan for the Eastwood Town Centre, which includes the provision of buildings of up to ten storeys high in the shopping and railway areas.;City of Ryde, [http://www.ryde.nsw.gov.au/WEB/SITE/RESOURCES/DOCUMENTS/Planning/4.1_dcp06.pdf &quot;Development Control Plan - Part 4.1 Eastwood Town Centre&quot;], 2006, pp. 11â€“12.

Transport
Eastwood is relatively well served by public transport. Eastwood Railway Station is located on the Northern Line.
