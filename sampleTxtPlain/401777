Steve Roach (born 1955 in La Mesa, California) is a pioneering American ambient musician, composer and performer.

His approach to ambient music has typically been beatless, although his rhythmic and trance-based groove and tribal-ambient releases are nearly as numerous as his more atmospheric releases. Some recordings are strictly synthesizer based, whereas some recordings include ambient guitar experiments, and other releases cross over with more ethnic influences.

The core of his innovative world of sound has been nourished by years of intense [http://steveroach.com/Live/Live.html live concerts] in many extraordinary worldwide settings. Since his first release in 1982, his [http://steveroach.com/discography recorded output] has been prodigious. 

He was an early proponent of the didgeridoo's use in ambient music and learned to play it during his extended trips to Australia during the 1980s. Later work with Mexican musician Jorge Reyes would introduce a Prehispanic element, and these fusions would further establish Roach as one of the founders of the tribal-ambient sound. 

His ability to create organic time-altering soundscapes reached a high point on the 2003 four-CD opus ''[http://steveroach.com/Music/discography.php?albumID=247 Mystic Chords &amp; Sacred Spaces]'', and has continued since 2006 in his prodigious ''[http://steveroach.com/Music/discography.php?albumID=373 Immersion]'' series. Recent releases ''[http://steveroach.com/Music/discography.php?albumID=333 Possible Planet]'' and ''[http://steveroach.com/Music/discography.php?albumID=334 New Life Dreaming]'' show a return to a more open, breathing sound first heard on ''[http://steveroach.com/Music/discography.php?albumID=19 Structures From Silence]'' and ''[http://steveroach.com/Music/discography.php?item=47 Dreamtime Return]'', two benchmark reference points for the new age/ambient genre.Steve Roach has influenced a wide range of ambient artists, including Vidna Obmana, Biosphere, and Stars of the Lid.
