Plot

First-time crook Sonny Wortzik and his friend Sal rob a Brooklyn bank to fund Sonny's boyfriend's sex change operation, only to discover that the bank has no money. Unsure what to do, the two robbers camp out in the bank, holding all the workers hostage. The police are alerted that there is a robbery in progress. Detective Moretti and numerous officers set up a siege around the bank. When Moretti calls the bank to tell the lead robber, Sonny, that the police have arrived, Sonny warns that he and his armed accomplice, Sal, have hostages and will kill them if anyone tries to come into the bank. Detective Moretti acts as hostage negotiator, while FBI Agent Sheldon monitors his actions. Howard, the security guard, has an asthma attack, so Sonny releases him when Moretti asks for a hostage as a sign of good faith. Moretti convinces Sonny to step outside the bank to see how aggressive the police forces are. After a moment, Sonny starts his now-famous Dog Day Afternoon#References in popular culture|&quot;ATTICA!&quot; chant, and the civilian crowd starts cheering for Sonny.

After realizing they cannot make a simple getaway, Sonny demands transportation: a jet to take them out of the country. When a tactical team approaches the back door, he fires a shot to warn them off. Moretti tries to persuade Sonny that those police were a separate unit that he was not controlling. Later, Sonny incites the crowd by throwing money over the police barricades. Some overrun the barricade and a few are arrested. When Sonny's wife Leon Schermer (a transwoman) arrives, she reveals that Sonny is robbing the bank to pay for Leon's sex reassignment surgery and that Sonny also has a legal wife, Angie, and children.Leon refuses to speak with Sonny, even over the telephone.

As night sets in, the lights in the bank all shut off.Sonny goes outside again and discovers that Agent Sheldon has taken command of the scene. He refuses to give Sonny any more favors, but when hostage Mulvaney goes into a diabetic shock, Agent Sheldon lets a doctor through. While the doctor is inside the bank, Sheldon convinces Leon to talk to Sonny on the phone. The two have a lengthy conversation that reveals Leon had attempted suicide to &quot;get away from&quot; Sonny.She had been hospitalized at the psychiatric ward of Bellevue Hospital until the police brought her to the scene. Leon turns down Sonny's offer to join him and Sal, to wherever they take the plane. Sonny tells police listening to the phone call that Leon had nothing to do with the robbery attempt.

Sal ''(right)'' guards Mulvaney.
After the phone call, the doctor asks Sonny to let Mulvaney leave and Sonny agrees.Mulvaney refuses, instead insisting he remain with his employees. The FBI calls Sonny out of the bank again.They have brought his mother to the scene. She unsuccessfully tries to persuade him to give himself up and Agent Sheldon signals that a limousine will arrive in ten minutes to take them to a waiting jet. Once back inside the bank, Sonny writes out his will, leaving money from his life insurance to Leon for her sex change and to his wife Angie. 

When the limousine arrives, Sonny checks it for any hidden weapons or booby traps. When he decides the car is satisfactory, he settles on Agent Murphy to drive Sal, the remaining hostages and him to John F. Kennedy International Airport|Kennedy Airport. Sonny sits in the front next to Murphy while Sal sits behind them. Murphy repeatedly asks Sal to point his gun at the roof so Sal won't accidentally shoot him. As they wait on the airport tarmac for the plane to taxi into position, Agent Sheldon forces Sonny's weapon onto the dashboard, creating a distraction which allows Murphy to pull a pistol hidden in his armrest and shoot Sal in the head. Sonny is immediately arrested and the hostages are all escorted to the terminal. The film ends with Sonny watching Sal's body being taken from the car on a stretcher.

Historical event
The location of the actual event, 450 Avenue P, Brooklyn NY (1975 photo)
The movie was based on the story of John Wojtowicz and adheres to the basic facts of whathappened, according to the ''Life'' article &quot;The Boys in the Bank&quot;. With Sal Naturile, Wojtowicz held up a Chase Manhattan Bank branch in Brooklyn, New York on August 22 1972.;; 

Many details from the actual robbery are depicted in the film, such as the arrival of Ernest Aron (Leon Schermer in the film) at the scene and her refusal to meet with Wojtowicz, the robbers demanding pizza (although in the actual event it was delivered by FBI agents, not a delivery boy),;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Dailynews082472.2.jpg To Crooks, It's All Pies in Sky] for ''New York Daily News'' by Ellen Fleysher on August 24 1972. Retrieved May 3 2006.; and the gun that was hidden in the getaway car used to shoot Naturile.; The robbery and resulting hostage situation took 14 hours from beginning to end;; in the film it appears to take about the same time.

After being apprehended, Wojtowicz was convicted in court and sentenced to twenty years in prison, of which he served fourteen. ;;

Wojtowicz wrote a letter to the New York Times in 1975 out of concern that people would believe the version of the events portrayed in the film, which he said was &quot;only 30% true&quot;. Some of Wojtowicz's objections included the portrayal of his wife Carmen Bifulco, the conversation with his mother that Wojtowicz claimed never happened, and the refusal of police to let him speak to his wife Carmen (unlike what was portrayed in the film). He did, however, praise Al Pacino and Chris Sarandon's portrayals of him and his wife Ernest Aron as accurate.;[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC15folder/RealDogDay.html Real ''Dog Day'' hero tells his story] by John Wojtowicz from Jump Cut, no. 15, 1977, pp. 31–32. Retrieved March 13, 2007;

The film shows Sonny making out a will to give Leon his life insurance.Even if Sonny should be killed, Leon might still be able to pay for the operation. The real-life Wojtowicz was paid $7,500 plus 1% of the film's net profits for the rights to his story, $2,500 of which he gave to Ernest Aron to pay for her sexual reassignment surgery.; Aron became Elizabeth Debbie Eden;[http://www.gaycenter.org/resources/archive/collection/006 Liz Eden Papers] for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Center 1973–1986 (Bulk 1974).

''New York Daily News'' article, August 24 1972
The original inspiration for the film was an article written by P. F. Kluge and Thomas Moore for ''Life'' in September 1972. The article included many of the details later used in the film and noted the relationship which Wojtowicz and Naturile developed with hostages and the police. Bank manager Robert Barrett said, &quot;I'm supposed to hate you guys [Wojtowicz/Naturile], but I've had more laughs tonight than I've had in weeks. We had a kind of camaraderie.&quot; Teller Shirley Bell said,&quot;[I]f they had been my houseguests on a Saturday night, it would have been hilarious.&quot;;The novelization of the film was penned by organized crime writer, Leslie Waller.

The film has no musical score other than the Elton John song &quot;Amoreena&quot; (which first appeared on John's 1970 album ''Tumbleweed Connection'') in the opening credits. Although many scenes within the bank establish that it was quite hot during the robbery, some outdoor sequences were shot in weather so cold that actors had to put ice in their mouths to stop their breath from showing on camera.; Exterior shots were filmed on location on Prospect Park West between 17th and 18th Street in Windsor Terrace of Brooklyn.The interior shots of the bank were filmed in a set created in a warehouse.;[http://www.newsday.com/about/ny-ihiny060805story,0,7582518.htmlstory?coll=4thrail-bottom-promo ''Dog Day Afternoon'' &quot;It Happened in New York&quot;] for Newsday by Cynthia Blair.

During the confrontation with the police, Sonny shouts the word &quot;Attica&quot; in order to rile up the crowd of onlookers, and gain their support in opposition to the police.

There have been numerous allusions to ''Dog Day Afternoon'' through the quoting of &quot;Attica!&quot; in movies and television over the last 30 years, including:

In the movie ''Swordfish'', John Travolta's character suggests that if Pacino had handled the hostage situation in ''Dog Day Afternoon'' as Pacino had originally told police he would (by &quot;throwing bodies out the front door&quot; to show he meant business), the robbery would have proven far more successful.;''Swordfish'' directed by Dominic Sena for Village Roadshow Pictures and Warner Bros, released 2001.; The film is also referenced in the Spike Lee film ''Inside Man'', also a film about a bank robbery and the resulting police siege, which featured many references to Al Pacino films.;''Inside Man'' directed by Spike Lee for 40 Acres and a Mule Productions, Imagine Entertainment, and Universal Pictures. Released 2006.; A 2000 documentary ''The Third Memory'', directed by Pierre Huyghe, contrasted news footage of the actual robbery with ''Dog Day Afternoon'' and a contemporary retelling of the events by John Wojtowicz.

The 1994 film ''Airheadss plot is similar to ''Dog Day Afternoon'', with its hostage situation, winning over the crowd with anti-establishment attitudes (chanting &quot;Rodney King, Rodney King!&quot; instead of &quot;Attica!&quot;), and creating a live TV media circus.In The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, &quot;Dog Show Afternoon&quot; was the title of the 25th episode, where Monroe (the dog) enters a dog show, while Juniper looks for a magical creature that got into the arena.
