Governor Obidov's involvement in several political scandals lost him favor with President Karimov, who personally attended his impeachment proceedings. According to an anonymous source who spoke with ''EurasiaNet'' Obidov &quot;was the province's master ... businesses favored by the hokim got the green light for everything. All the entrepreneurs who enjoyed [Obidov's] patronage,&quot; including the 23 businessmen, &quot;grew rich.&quot; In late 2004 Karimov appointed Ikromkhon Nazhmiddinov, who succeeded Begaliyev as the Minister of Agriculture and Water, Governor of Ferghana province.;

The source said, &quot;Criminal proceedings were started against many of his [Obidov's] administration members. The new hokim also decided to re-divide the businesses in the province; he cracked down on the entrepreneurs who had been supported by Obidov. They were told to sell their businesses for a pittance either to him [Begaliyev] or his people, or face legal proceedings.&quot;;

Prior to the Andijan massacre the Samarqand clan maintained control over the Interior Ministry under the leadership of Zakir Almatov and the Tashkent clan controlled the National Security Service under the leadership of Rustam Innoyatov. Rustam Burnashev and Irina Chernykh of the Central Asia-Institute argue that rumors of Karimov's resignation due to ill-health prompted the two leaders to try to seize power. Both leaders considered coup d’états in 2004, early 2005, and in mid-2005.;[http://216.109.125.130/search/cache?p=resignation+Karimov+andijan&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;x=wrt&amp;u=www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/CEF/Quarterly/February_2007/Burnashev_Chernykh.pdf&amp;w=resignation+karimov+andijan&amp;d=MPllo_mdOfRN&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us Changes in Uzbekistan’s Military Policy after the Andijan Events] Central Asia-Institute Silk Road Studies Program;

During the unrest security forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defense acted as police forces. Ministry of Interior troops were abolished and counter-terrorism divisions were put under the command of the Ministry of Defense or the National Security Service, run by the Tashkent clan. Karimov fired Defense Minister Kadyr Gulyamov, Interior Minister Almatov, Head of the Joint Headquarters of the Armed Forces Ismail Ergashev, and Commander of the Eastern military district Kosimali Akhmedov. Karimov replaced Almatov with the deputy director of the Uzbek National Security Service, a member of the Tashkent clan. This greatly shifted control of security to the Tashkent clan which has traditionally controlled the National Security Service.;;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/08/970cdfca-adb7-4c9c-856b-526cef00273b.html Uzbekistan: Karimov appears to have political clans firmly in hand] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty; Analysts had previously suggested that the Interior Ministry, under Almatov's leadership, had organized the 1999 Tashkent bombings. Others have suggested the bombings were done by the SNB under the leadership of Rustam Inoyatov, who at the time led the Tashkent clan. Analysts suggested a series of bombings in 2004 in Tashkent and Bukhara may have been done by the SNB against the MVD.;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/04/51d08217-f03f-4906-9cc7-6224a3cff08b.html Uzbekistan: Islam Karimov vs. The clans] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty;
