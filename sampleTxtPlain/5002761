St John's College, Woodlawn is a Catholic systemic secondary school, located in the rural area of &quot;Woodlawn&quot; on the outskirts of Lismore, New South Wales, Australia.;

In the city of Lismore the four largest industries by employment are; retail sector, health care, education and agriculture. St John's College, originally an agricultural secondary school, has a major part in two of these sectors and of course participates indirectly in the others as well.;

The school's name is often shortened to &quot;Woodlawn&quot; rather than being named fully. After 75 years the name is a source of pride and honour throughout the local and educational communities. The School was founded by the Marists who continue to play a role in the running of the school. The first lay Rector (Principal) is Glenn Roff who holds the role currently.

History

''&quot;St John's Educational and Agricultural College at Woodlawn, on the outskirts of Lismore, and architectural jewel adorning the pastoral diadem of the North Coast, is destined to make history throughout all States of the Commonwealth. Its inspiration is eloquent tribute to the zeal, enthusiasm and practical outlook of that order of the Roman Catholic Church, the Marist Fathers.&quot;''

= The 75th Anniversary=
St John's College Woodlawn celebrated its 75th Anniversary in 2006. The College held many events throughout the year to celebrate, ranging from the first &quot;Woodlawn Race Day&quot;, to &quot;St John's Youth Day&quot; and formal ceremonies. The opening of the renovated Chapel was a central part of the ceremonies, with hundreds of Alumni returning to be apart of the celebrations. After the Woodlawn Race Day (also known as the Woodlawn Cup), the College executive in association with the Parents and Friends executive decided to hold the day annually.

The Ethos and Spirit of the College
= Mission Statement=
''St John's College, Woodlawn builds on its traditions as a welcoming family, based on the Catholic faith, and aims for its members to be touched by a Christian spirituality. 
Through inspired leadership, we endeavour to assist all our community to achieve their full potential. We aim to provide an education which is relevant to the 21st century, based on a harmony of the physical, academic, cultural and spiritual.''

=The College's Motto=
''&quot;Tenete Traditiones&quot;'', is taken from Saint Paul's second letter to the Thessalonians: &quot;God called you to this through the Good News we preached to you; He called you to possess your share of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. So then, our brothers, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions which we taught you, both in our preaching and our writing&quot;. (2 Thessalonians 2:14-15)

=The College's Crest=
St John's College Woodlawn's crest shows the three colours of Woodlawn (Red, Green and Gold), and also St John's Eagle in the upper right corner, with the Society of Mary's symbol shown in the lower left corner. With ''Tenete Traditiones'' below this completes the image of the holistic parts of the college.

=The College Patron=
St John's College ''Woodlawn is named after St John the Evangelist''. St John was one of the twelve apostles and tradition tells us that he was a close friend of Jesus. We celebrate his feast day at the beginning of the academic year. As John's gospel is said to provide a view of the life of Jesus from high above St John's symbol is the Eagle and therefore the eagle is held as an important symbol for the college. 'The Eagle' is also the title of the College annual magazine.
