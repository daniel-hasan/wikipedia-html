 is a Japanese animation film studio, and previously was a subsidiary of Tokuma Shoten. Its emotional anime films are widely praised all over the world. Its name derives from the nickname the Italians used for their Saharan scouting planes in the Second World War (and later for the AMX International AMX), which derived from the Libyan word for ''hot wind blowing through the Sahara Desert'' (also known as sirocco). Though the Italian word is pronounced with hard /g/, the Japanese pronunciation of the studio's name is'. The theory behind the name was that the studio was blowing a new wind into the Japanese anime industry. The company's logo features the character Totoro from the film ''My Neighbor Totoro''.

Anime created by Studio Ghibli that have won the Animage Anime Grand Prix award have been ''Castle in the Sky'' in 1986, ''My Neighbor Totoro'' in 1988, and ''Kiki's Delivery Service'' in 1989.

History
Founded in 1985, it is headed by the acclaimed director Hayao Miyazaki along with his colleague and mentor Isao Takahata, as well as the studio's executive managing director and long-time producer Toshio Suzuki. Its origins date back to 1983, with the film ''Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind'', which was popularized as a serialized manga in a publication of Tokuma Shoten's ''Animage'' magazine after the original screenplay was rejected. The film was eventually produced by Topcraft and the film's success spurred the formation of Ghibli. Much of Ghibli's works are distributed in Japan by the noted film distributor Toho. Tokuma is the parent company of Studio Ghibli, and it has provided the Walt Disney Company with the video rights to all of Ghibli's output that did not have previous international distribution, including the global, non-Japan distribution rights to ''Princess Mononoke'' and ''Spirited Away''. Miyazaki's latest film, ''Howl's Moving Castle'', was based on a book by British author Diana Wynne Jones, published in several countries including Canada and the United States. Composer Joe Hisaishi has provided the soundtrack for all of Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films.

The most famous and lauded film from the studio that was not directed by Miyazaki is ''Grave of the Fireflies'', directed by Isao Takahata, a sad film focusing on the lives of two war orphans towards the end of Second World War in Japan.This is the only film which Disney declined to distribute.

Over the years, there has been a close relationship between Studio Ghibli and the magazine ''Animage'', which regularly runs exclusive articles about the studio and its members in a section titled &quot;Ghibli Notes.&quot; Artwork from Ghibli's films and other works frequently graces the cover of the magazine. 

The company is well-known for its strict &quot;no-edits&quot; policy in licensing their films abroad. This has stemmed from the disastrous dubbing of Miyazaki's ''Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind'' when the film was released in the United States as ''Warriors of the Wind''. The film was heavily edited and Americanized, with significant portions cut and the plot rewritten. The &quot;no cuts&quot; policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein suggested editing ''Princess Mononoke'' to make it more marketable. In response, one of Studio Ghibli producers sent an authentic katana with a simple message: &quot;No cuts&quot;.;;

Miyazaki is currently working on a new film, ''Gake no ue no Ponyo'', literally &quot;Ponyo on a Cliff.&quot;;;It will be released in summer of 2008, while Takahata is currently working on a new film as well (with no title yet), that will be released in 2008 or 2009.
