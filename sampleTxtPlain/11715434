The Vatican Railway Station
Rail transport in Vatican City consists of two 300-metre sets of rail tracks within Vatican City, the shortest national railway system in the world.;Korn, Frank J. 2000. ''A Catholic's Guide to Rome: Discovering the Soul of the Eternal City''. Paulist Press. ISBN 080913926X. p. 49.; Access to Italian rail lines was guaranteed by the Lateran Treaty (1929), and tracks and station were constructed during the reign of Pope Pius XI.

Most railway traffic consists of freight good importation, although the railway has occasionally carried passengers, usually for symbolic or ceremonial reasons.;Walsh, Michael J. 2005. ''Roman Catholicism: The Basics''. Routledge. ISBN 0415263808. p. 95.;;Garwood, Duncan. 2006. ''Rome''. Lonely Planet. ISBN 1740597109. p. 141.;

History
Pope Gregory XVI had prevented the construction of railways in the Papal States, and was reputed to have said &quot;''chemin de fer, chemin d'enfer''&quot; (&quot;the iron road is the road to hell&quot;).;Pollard, John. 2005. ''Money and the Rise of the Modern Papacy''. ISBN 0521812046. p. 29.; Gregory XVI's successor, Pope Pius IX, began the construction of a rail line from Bologna to Ancona but the territory was seized by the armies of the Risorgimento in 1861 before it was completed.; That rail travel was a prerequisite for the mass pilgrimages of the 19th century, beginning with those at Lourdes circa 1858, and was one factor that softened opposition to such technology within the Roman Curia.;Alberigo, Giuseppe, and Komonchak, Joseph A. 2003. ''History of Vatican II''. Peeters Publishers. ISBN 9068317245. p. 76.;

The construction of a railway station in Vatican City and its linkage to the Italian rail lines was guaranteed by the Lateran Treaty of February 11 1929. The Directorate of New Railway Construction of the Ministry of Public Works of the Kingdom of Italy implemented this provision with construction beginning on April 3 1929 to establish earthworks 38 m above sea level (the height of the &quot;Roma - San Pietro&quot; station) between Piazza Santa Marta and the Palazzo del Governatorato.; The construction of the viaduct leading to Vatican City was paid for by the Italian government; the station within the Vatican was financed out of the ₤750 million indemnity agreed to in the Lateran Treaty's financial annex.;Reese, Thomas J. 1996. ''Inside the Vatican: The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church''. Harvard University Press. ISBN 0674932617. p. 203.;

The first locomotive entered the Vatican in March 1932. A Railway Convention was ratified between Italy and Vatican City on September 12 1934 and in October 1934 the Ministry of Public Works handed over the completed rail lines to Vatican City and Ferrovie dello Stato, respectively.;

''Legge sulle fonti del diritto'' (June 7 1929) made Italian railway legislation binding on Vatican-controlled railways.;

Route
The Vatican City State Railway branches off from the Rome to Viterbo railway line at the &quot;Roma - San Pietro&quot; station and crosses Gelsomino valley via a 143.12 metre long masonry viaduct of eight 15.30 metre arches (bearing the Fasces and the :Image:CoA fam ITA savoia.svg|Savoy Coat of Arms), which crosses Viale Vaticano (which it interrupts) and Via Aurelia. The Via delle Cave and the Via del Gelsomino are also interrupted by the viaduct and thus merge with the Via Aurelia.;

Before passing through the Vatican City walls and terminating in the Vatican Railway Station, the line passes under an arch decorated with the Coat of Arms of Pope Pius XI with a sliding two-piece 35.5 ton iron gate which slides into the recesses of the Vatican walls.;;

The Vatican Railway Station (later split into a Goods Office and numismatic and philatelic museum) was built approximately 20 m from the Entrance Gateway by architect Giuseppe Momo, opening in 1933.; Its simple white, Italian marble design was described by writer H.G. Morton as &quot;more like a branch of the Barclay Bank in London.&quot;;

Uses
The Vatican railway has been used primarily for importing goods (before automobile travel became more common and less expensive) into the Vatican and intermittently for ordinary passenger trains.

The planned papal train of Pius XI was never constructed and the Vatican has never employed any railway men or registered any rolling stock.; The official train of Pope Pius IX remains on display at the Museum of Rome in the Palazzo Braschi.;

Pope John XXIII on October 4 1962 became the first pope to use the Vatican railway during his pilgrimate to Loreto and Assisi one week before the beginning of Second Vatican Council using the Italian presidential train; the trip was broadcast on the Eurovision Network. Because Pope Pius IX had been both the last pope to visit Loreto (as the head of the Papal States) and the last pope to travel by train, the journey was viewed as a symbolic break from the &quot;burdens of the past.&quot;;Prusak, Bernard P. 2004. ''The Church Unfinished: Ecclesiology Through the Centuries''. Paulist Press. ISBN 0809142864. p. 271.; John XXIII also arranged for the remains of Pope Pius X to be transferred to Venice using the Vatican railway.;

Pope John Paul II used the railway a handful of times for symbolic purposes, as early as November 8 1979, but did not use the railway to leave Rome until January 24 2002.;Holy See Press Office. 28 January 2001. Trans. Glyn Williams. &quot;[http://www.sinfin.net/railways/world/vatican/vaticanrail.html The Vatican City State Railway].&quot;;

In late March 1944, at the height of the allied bombing of Rome in World War II, the Vatican discovered a German munitions train stopped on the line by the Vatican railway station.;Chadwick, Owen. 1988.
