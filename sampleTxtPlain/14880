The official logo of the ICC
The International Criminal Court (ICC or ICCt);International Criminal Court is sometimes abbreviated as ICCt to distinguish it from several other organizations abbreviated as ICC.However, the more common abbreviation ICC is used in this article.; was established in 2002 as a permanent tribunal to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, although it cannot currently exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression.;The Court came into being on July 1 2002 — the date its founding treaty, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, entered into force; — and it can only prosecute crimes committed on or after that date.;

As of January 2008, 105 states are members of the Court.;A further 41 countries have signed but not ratified the Rome Statute.;However, a number of states, including China, India and the United States, are critical of the Court and have not joined.

The Court can generally exercise jurisdiction only in cases where the accused is a national of a state party, the alleged crime took place on the territory of a state party, or a situation is referred to the Court by the United Nations Security Council.;The Court is designed to complement existing national judicial systems: it can exercise its jurisdiction only when national courts are unwilling or unable to investigate or prosecute such crimes.;;Primary responsibility to investigate and punish crimes is therefore left to individual states.;

To date, the Court has opened investigations into four situations: Northern Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic and Darfur.;The Court has issued nine public arrest warrants; and two suspects are in custody, awaiting trial.

The official seat of the Court is in The Hague, Netherlands, but its proceedings may take place anywhere.;The ICC is sometimes referred to as a &quot;world court&quot;; it should not be confused with the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, which is the United Nations organ that settles disputes between nations.;International Criminal Court.

History
In 1948, following the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals, the United Nations General Assembly recognised the need for a permanent international court to deal with atrocities of the kind committed during World War II.;At the request of the General Assembly, the International Law Commission drafted two draft statutes by the early 1950s but these were shelved as the Cold War made the establishment of an international criminal court politically unrealistic.;Gary T.

Jurisdiction
=Crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court=
Article 5 of the Rome Statute grants the Court jurisdiction over four groups of crimes, which it refers to as the “most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole”: the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression.The statute defines each of these crimes except for aggression: it provides that the Court will not exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until such time as the states parties agree on a definition of the crime and set out the conditions under which it may be prosecuted.;[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 5] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 23 November 2006.;

Many states wanted to add terrorism and drug trafficking to the list of crimes covered by the Rome Statute; however, the states were unable to agree on a definition for terrorism and it was decided not to include drug trafficking as this might overwhelm the Court's limited resources.;United Nations Department of Public Information, December 2002.

Some commentators have argued that the Rome Statute defines crimes too broadly or too vaguely.For example, China has argued that the definition of ‘war crimes’ goes beyond that accepted under customary international law.;Lu Jianping and Wang Zhixiang. “China's Attitude Towards the ICC” in ''Journal of International Criminal Justice'', July 2005.;

=Territorial jurisdiction=
During the negotiations that led to the Rome Statute, a large number of states argued that the Court should be allowed to exercise universal jurisdiction.However, this proposal was defeated due in large part to opposition from the United States.;Elizabeth Wilmhurst, 1999. ‘Jurisdiction of the Court’, p. 136.In Roy S Lee (ed.), ''The International Criminal Court: The Making of the Rome Statute''.The Hague: Kluwer Law International. ISBN 90-411-1212-X.;A compromise was reached, allowing the Court to exercise jurisdiction only under the following limited circumstances:
*where the person accused of committing a crime is a national of a state party (or where the person's state has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court); 
*where the alleged crime was committed on the territory of a state party (or where the state on whose territory the crime was committed has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court); or
*where a situation is referred to the Court by the UN Security Council.;[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Articles 12 &amp; 13] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 23 November 2006.;

=Temporal jurisdiction=
The Court's jurisdiction does not apply retroactively: it can only prosecute crimes committed on or after 1 July 2002 (the date on which the Rome Statute entered into force).Where a state becomes party to the Rome Statute after that date, the Court can exercise jurisdiction automatically with respect to crimes committed after the statute enters into force for that state.;[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 11] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 23 November 2006.;

=Complementarity=
The Court is intended as a court of last resort, investigating and prosecuting only where national courts have failed.Article 17 of the Statute provides that a case is inadmissible if:

:‘(a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;

:(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of the State genuinely to prosecute;

:(c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;

:(d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court.’;[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 17] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 4 December 2006.;

Article 20, paragraph 3, specifies that, if a person has already been tried by another court, the ICC cannot try them again for the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:

:‘(a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court; or

:(b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice.’;[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 20] of the Rome Statute.
