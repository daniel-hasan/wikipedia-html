;In the fictional universe of ''Babylon 5'', spoo is a valuable and highly desired food product. Made from the alien worm-like creatures of the same name, spoo is considered to be the most delicious food in the galaxy, regardless of which species is asked. Although it is a universally loved foodstuff and an actively traded commodity, the creature itself is regarded with contempt by the races that consume it. 

Since its introduction on the ''Babylon 5'' television series, spoo has remained popular among fans of the science fiction saga, spawning everything from attempts to cook their own version of spoo, to fan fiction related to the creatures. &quot;Spoo&quot; is also used variously outside the ''Babylon 5'' universe and fan community as a nonsense word.

Origins in ''Babylon 5''
Spoo appeared in the first episode of the science fiction television series ''Babylon 5'', when it was briefly mentioned by the Narn Ambassador, G'Kar.;Mentioned in the episode &quot;Midnight on the Firing Line,&quot; by Straczynski.; J. Michael Straczynski, the show's creator, executive producer, and writer of the episode in question, was soon deluged by questions from fans from the various internet message boards on which he frequently participated.;Straczynski's use of Usenet and other internet forums is well known. See, for instance:

=Explanation of Spoo=

After several years of cryptic answers, Straczynski finally made a post explaining what Spoo was. His answer stated that spoo were tiny, pasty, mealworm-like creatures that were 
regarded with contempt by most of the sentient species that have encountered it. According to Straczynski, spoo &quot;are the only creatures of which the Interstellar Animal Rights Protection League says, simply, 'Kill 'em.'&quot;;

The process of raising spoo was described by Straczynski in comical detail. The creatures are raised on ranches on planets with moist and chilly climates, not because the creatures thrive in such environs, but because it produces the best level of paleness in the creatures' skin. Starting a spoo ranch is relatively easy: the only requirement is to place 200 spoo in the middle of the ranch and wait. Within a short period of time, they have reproduced in sufficient numbers and harvesting can commence, with the preferred method being a simple whack with a stick. Little physical effort is required to cull the herds—spoo are incapable of moving more than six&amp;nbsp;inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) in a year, tend to stay propped up against one another &quot;ostensibly for mutual protection,&quot; with attempts at movement usually ending up in the creatures toppling over. The primary difficulty in spoo ranching is in the only sound the creatures make: loud, continuous sighing. The only protection against the sighing is the use of earmuffs, which eventually cannot block the sheer volume of sighs as the harvest progresses—when whacked, a spoo simply sighs more loudly.The sighing often triggers bouts of major depression, with some ranchers even going mad from the incessant sighs.;

=Spoo in the series=

Although mostly relegated to a background role, spoo was once involved in a significant way in a plot. In the season 5 episode ''A Tragedy of Telepaths'', the fact that Narn prefer fresh spoo while the Centauri prefer it aged was the reason that G'Kar was able to figure out that there was another Narn in the Centauri Royal Palace.;&quot;A Tragedy of Telepaths,&quot; written by Straczynski. See its Lurker's Guide page at [http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/098.html midwinter.com.] Retrieved on 2007-08-11.;

As befitting a fan-favorite reference, Spoo made a number of appearances in the series, most recently in the DVD release ''Babylon 5: The Lost Tales'', where President Sheridan at one point jokes that the product is &quot;Spoo: The other gray meat.&quot;; From the ''Babylon 5: The Lost Tales|Lost Tales'' episode &quot;Babylon_5:_The_Lost_Tales#Voices_in_the_Dark|Voices in the Dark&quot; by Straczynski.; 

=Commodity=
As a widely consumed food product, like coffee or beef, spoo is a traded commodity, where the price of the product at the consumer level is dictated by the price on common exchanges. During one episode the price of a spoo sandwich is stated as ten credits an ounce; at the end of the same episode it is stated as fifteen credits.;Spoo is a conversation piece in the episode &quot;A View from the Gallery,&quot; written by Straczynski from a story by Harlan Ellison and Straczynski. See its Lurker's Guide page at [http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/092.html midwinter.com.]Retrieved on 2007-08-11.; While this could be a simple mistake by Straczynski, a bit of fanon assumes that it is an intentional reference to spoo's exorbitant volatility in the market.;This view is expressed in the &quot;Notes&quot; section of the Lurker's Guide page for the episode at [http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/092.html#NO midwinter.com.]Retrieved on 2007-08-11.;

Unlike other products, not only is spoo a tradable commodity, but spoo ranches themselves, like large corporations, sell shares.;In the episode &quot;The Geometry of Shadows,&quot; a Technomage infected Londo's personal computers with a virus that converted all his personal finances into a purchase of 200,000 shares in a spoo ranch.; It is not known if this is facilitated by spoo's immense popularity or because the ranches' value is exacerbated by their rarity (due to the difficulty of, and disproportionately high suicide rate in, spoo ranching).

Real-world spoo
In 1998, Boxtree UK published a ''Babylon 5'' cookbook, officially licensed from Warner Bros.;; Presented as if written around the year 2260, the time when most of the ''Babylon 5'' series takes place, the book contains many recipes for the various foods mentioned and seen throughout the series. Included were recipes for Narn-style spoo and Centauri-style spoo, both using currently available ingredients, with sea scallops taking the place of spoo. 

Many fans have attempted to make &quot;spoo&quot; on their own. One common method is the use of tofu, itself a rather versatile and nondescript food with a pale color. There have been times when Straczynski has been eating at a restaurant or event, and a fan will send over a plate of food, christened &quot;spoo.&quot;;This anecdote was mentioned as an aside in a GEnie post from September 4 1996.

Real-world etymology of the word
A promotional advertisement from the ''Babylon Park: Spoohunter'' parody.;
Straczynski was not the first person to use the word spoo - uses can be found in popular culture since the 1970s, sometimes as a replacement for ''stuff'', as was the case with its first recorded use on USENET in 1989,;The first USENET occurrence was July 28, 1989 - See the post archived via Google at [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/sci.physics/msg/7379a1827e328633?dmode=source&amp;hl=en sci.physics.]Retrieved on 2007-08-11.; and later as a misspelling of ''spew''. The earliest known print usage was as an exclamation in a 1971 Beetle Bailey comic strip, as a play on the reverse spelling of &quot;oops.&quot;;''Beetle Bailey'', April 18 1971, as reproduced in Mort Walker, ''I'll Throw the Book at You, Beetle Bailey'' (New York: Tempo/Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1973, ISBN 0-448-05582-1).; In 1979 Barnes &amp; Barnes recorded the song &quot;Three Drunk Newts&quot; which begins with what has been interpreted as the two of them yelling &quot;Spoo!&quot;. According to ''Slang and Euphemism'', ''spoo'' is a slang term for ejaculate, etymologically derived from ''spew'', and cited by linguist Pamela Munro in a paper on 1980s collegiate slang at UCLA.;From &quot;UCLA slang: a dictionary of slang words and expressions used at UCLA,&quot; (Volume 1 of the UCLA Slang series), ''UCLA Occasional Papers in Linguistics'' No. 8 (1989), by F.

He claimed in ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'' to have learned the word from guitarist Ike Willis, and also used ''spoo'' to mean self-indulgent &quot;musical masturbation,&quot; in which musicians play an extended solo primarily for their own enjoyment rather than to enhance the musical experience of the audience.;;;

Skeletor is offered Spoo by Spritina from ''She-Ra|She-Ra Princess of Power'' episode &quot;Gateway To Trouble.&quot; ; 

Straczynski's own usage of the word predates ''Babylon 5''. Straczynski was a writer in the 1985 cartoon series ''She-Ra|She-Ra Princess of Power''. After a fan recalled a possible spoo reference from that show, Straczynski replied, &quot;[Yes], I slipped some spoo in there once.

Since its advent and popularization in ''Babylon 5'', some people in the science fiction community have used the term &quot;spoo space&quot; on online message boards instead of spoiler space.; Internet example at [http://boards.theforce.net/eu_community/b10194/7432408/p3 Jedi Council Forums], and numerous USENET examples can be attained via a Google search, (linked at [http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?q=%22spoo%20space%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wg Google groups]).Both retrieved on 2007-08-11.; Spoo is spoofed in the first ''Babylon Park'' parody short, ''Spoohunter''.;The short can be accessed at [http://www.babylonpark.com/ Babylon Park.]Retrieved on 2007-08-11.;
