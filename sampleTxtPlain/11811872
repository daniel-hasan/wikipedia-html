''Bánh'' is a Vietnamese term translating loosely as &quot;cake.&quot; As such, it may, with the addition of qualifying adjectives, refer to a wide variety of distinct cakes, buns, pastries, and other similar food items from Vietnamese cuisine, which may be cooked by steaming, baking, frying, deep-frying, or boiling.

''Bánh'' may also refer to certain varieties of noodles, such as for example ''bánh canh'' or ''bánh hỏi''.

Each variety of ''bánh'' is designated by a descriptive word or phrase that follows the word ''bánh'', such as ''bánh bò'' (literally &quot;cow cake&quot;) or ''bánh chuối'' (literally &quot;banana cake&quot;).
