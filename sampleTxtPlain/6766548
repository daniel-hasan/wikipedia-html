p14ARF is an alternate reading frame (ARF) product of the CDKN2A locus. Both p16INK4a and p14ARF are involved in cell cycle regulation. p14ARF inhibits mdm2, thus promoting p53, which promotes p21 activation, which then binds and inactivates certain cyclin-CDK complexes, which would otherwise promote transcription of genes that would carry the cell through the G;1;/S checkpoint of the cell cycle.Loss of p14ARF by a Mutation#By_inheritance|homozygous mutation in the CDKN2A (INK4A) gene will lead to elevated levels in MDM2 and therefore loss of p53 function and cell cycle control.
