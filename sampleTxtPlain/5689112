Cornelius Petrus Johannes &quot;Corné&quot; Krige (born 21 March 1975 in Lusaka, Zambia) was a South African;[http://www.sportsillustrated.co.za/static/feature/story.php?id=207 ''Sports Illustrated'': &quot;Corne should have stayed', by Sibongile Maputi.] Retrieved 20 June 2007.; rugby union footballer, now retired, who played flanker for Western Province in the Currie Cup, the Stormers in Super Rugby and captained the South African national side, the Springboks.

Corne Krige was Zambian-born and his parents still reside in that country, but he was schooled in South Africa at Paarl Boys High School, about 60km from Cape Town. He played most of his rugby for South African teams, and resides in that country.

Krige's Test debut came in 1999 after recovering from career-threatening knee and hand injuries. He captained the Springboks on his test debut in a 101-0 victory over Italy in Durban; unfortunately two weeks later he suffered another serious knee injury against the All Blacks in Dunedin which ended his hopes of captaining the Springboks at the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales. Krige appeared in 39 tests for South Africa, became the full-time captain in 2002,;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/3393271.stm &quot;Krige quits Test rugby&quot;], ''BBC'', 13 January 2004.; and captained the Boks 18 times in all;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/english/3927021.stm &quot;Saints seal Krige deal&quot;], ''BBC'', 26 July 2004.; before his international retirement in January 2004.;

Never one to shy away from dirty play, he was the subject of controversy after the November 2002 Test against England at Twickenham that saw England hand the Boks the worst defeat in their history (53-3). During the match, an increasingly frustrated South Africa side began targeting England players with physical off-the-ball attacks, and match footage showed Krige as the leader.;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/2525929.stm &quot;Krige in the spotlight&quot;], ''BBC'', 28 November 2002.; His Super Rugby career then ended several weeks early when he was handed an eight-week ban for head-butting an opponent in 2004. 

He finished his career in the English Premiership with Northampton Saints, signing for the 2004-05 Zurich Premiership|2004-05 season.; He retired at the end of that season and returned to Cape Town to pursue outside business interests.;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/english/4255471.stm &quot;Saints star Krige to quit playing&quot;], ''BBC'', 10 February 2005.; Krige would make one more high-profile appearance on a rugby field, captaining a Western Province XV against a World XV in his testimonial at Newlands on 9 June 2006.

Krige and former Springbok teammates Bobby Skinstad and Robbie Fleck were business partners, owning Billie the B.U.M.S. Restaurant and a Cocktail Bar in Newlands. The restaurant has since closed.

When the Boks played the Australia Wallabies during the later years of Krige's captaincy, he and Wallabies captain George Gregan shared an unusual distinction: both were born in the same hospital.;[http://www.thegoal.com/players/rugby/krige_corne/captain.html &quot;Captain Courageous: Corné Krige&quot;], ''TheGoal.com'', retrieved 26 June 2006.;;[http://sport.guardian.co.uk/rugbyworldcup2003/story/0,,1054302,00.html &quot;Rugby Union World Cup Special Reports: South Africa&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 6 October 2003.;
