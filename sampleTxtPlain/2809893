The 2003 Mitsubishi &quot;i&quot; Concept debuted the car's striking exterior.
Two prototypes were exhibited during the car's development. The first was the &quot;i&quot; Concept, which debuted at the 60th Frankfurt Motor Show in 2003, and previewed the car's striking exterior.; Motoring journalists were quick to seize on the distinctive silhouette, calling it &quot;a very good egg&quot;,;[http://motoring.independent.co.uk/features/article1090796.ece &quot;Mitsubishi 'i': All round, a very good egg&quot;], Euan Sey, ''The Independent'', June 20 2006; and a &quot;crystal ball&quot; with which to see the future of Mitsubishi.;[http://www.redbook.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story/D468D5BB21915C26CA2572100028B913?OpenDocument &quot;Tokyo show: Mitsubishi's crystal ball concepts&quot;], Byron Mathioudakis, redbook.goauto.com, 21 October 2003; One reviewer even speculated it to be an allusion by the vehicle's French-born designer Olivier Boulay to the Renault 4CV, France's popular post-war &quot;people's car&quot; with which the i shared its four seat, rear-engined layout.; Its styling was formally lauded when the i won the Grand Prize at the 50th anniversary Good Design Awards from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in October 2006, the first ''kei'' car to win the award.;[http://www.g-mark.org/english/archive/2006/award-best15.html &quot;Good Design Grand Prize 2006&quot;], G-Mark.org;;[http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/corporate/detail1539.html &quot;i&quot; takes Good Design Grand Prize 2006], Mitsubishi Motors press release, October 25 2006;

;
The 2003 Mitsubishi Se-Ro concept, which introduced the 660&amp;nbsp;cc engine used in the production version of the i.

The &quot;i&quot; Concept was powered by a 999&amp;nbsp;cc powerplant with the company's Mitsubishi Smart Idling (MSI) system, which turns off the engine automatically when the vehicle is stationary, and can restart it within 0.2&amp;nbsp;seconds.;[http://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/corporate/about_us/technology/review/e/pdf/2004/16E.pdf Mitsubishi Motors Technical Review 2004 no.16, pp.29-50]; So equipped, Mitsubishi claimed the car was capable of fulfilling the &quot;three litre initiative&quot; for gasoline engines, meaning fuel consumption of no more than 3.0&amp;nbsp;litres per 100&amp;nbsp;kilometres (94.2&amp;nbsp;mpg, 78.4&amp;nbsp;U.S.&amp;nbsp;mpg).

The second prototype, called the Se-Ro and exhibited at the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show, previewed the production model's more conventional mechanical underpinnings, despite having a more radical appearance which bore little resemblance to the final design.;[http://archive.cardesignnews.com/autoshows/2003/tokyo/preview/mitsubishi-sero/index.html &quot;Mitsubish Sero concept for the Tokyo Motor Show&quot;], Car Design News, October 16 2003; Instead, its polished aluminium body was styled to resemble a zeppelin or airship.;[http://www.channel4.com/4car/ft/feature/concept+car/1577/1 &quot;Concept Car: Mitsubishi SE-RO&quot;], 4Car, November 13 2003;;[http://www.motortrend.com/future/concept_cars/112_0310_mitsubishi_se_ro &quot;First Look: Mitsubishi Se-Ro&quot;], Brandy A.

Technical details
=Body and dimensions=
A lightweight aluminium space frame structure and a rear-engined layout allowed Mitsubishi to incorporate a larger front crumple zone, in order to meet current safety legislation without compromising interior space.; With no powertrain in front of the driver, the designers were able to shorten the front overhang and lengthen the wheelbase to 2550&amp;nbsp;millimetres (100.4&amp;nbsp;in), giving greater legroom for passengers than many comparable ''kei'' cars whose wheelbase is typically 130–190&amp;nbsp;millimetres (5.1–7.5&amp;nbsp;in) less.; The downside of this design was a reduction in cargo-carrying capacity, which was necessarily compromised by the engine's location in the rear.;[http://www.channel4.com/4car/di/road+test/driving+impression/993/3 &quot;Driven: Mitsubishi i&quot;], Euan Sey, 4Car, April 26, 2006;;[http://www.nihoncarandbike.com/news-280-X.html &quot;Mitsubishi i&quot;], G-A.G, Nihon Car and Bike, May 15 2006;
Image:Mitsubishi_i_2.jpg|thumb|right|The engine of the i as seen in cutaway, behind the rear seats and under the floor of the rear hatch storage area, just ahead of the rear axle.

=Drivetrain=
The i has a &quot;rear-midship&quot; engine mounted just ahead of the rear axle, a highly unusual configuration in a small car where front-engine design has dominated since the 1970s.; The ''3B20'' three cylinder powerplant has an aluminium cylinder block, a displacement of 659&amp;nbsp;cubic centimetres, and incorporates double overhead camshafts with ''MIVEC'' variable valve timing in the cylinder head. Initially only an intercooled and turbocharged engine was offered, until a naturally aspirated version was introduced for 2007.;[http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/corporate/detail1542.html &quot;Mitsubishi Motors Announces FY2006 First Half Financial Results and Forecasts for the Full Year&quot;], Mitsubishi Motors press release, October 30 2006;;; A four-speed automatic gearbox transmits power to the rear or four-wheel drive|all four wheels, depending on specification.

=Suspension, brakes and tires=
Two Mitsubishi i ''kei cars'' photographed together in Japan. The silver i is a dealer model for customers to test drive.
MacPherson struts are used in the front suspension, and an unusual three-link De Dion tube/Watt's linkage is used in the rear.; Front discs with anti-lock braking system|anti-lock braking (ABS) and electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) are standard across the range.;; In common with many other mid- or rear-engined vehicles its fifteen&amp;nbsp;inch wheels have uneven-sized tires, 145/65 on the fronts and wider 175/55 on the rears, in an effort to minimise the chances of oversteer caused by the rear-biased weight distribution.;

=Specifications=
Three individual models, or grades, were available on the car's release in 2006; ''S'', ''M'', and ''G'', in ascending order of price. They all shared the same five-door hatchback body style and turbocharged engine, but offered differing levels of options and standard equipment. In 2007 the base ''S'' model was given the new naturally aspirated powerplant, and was positioned below the two new grades, ''L'' and ''LX'', whose engine it shared.;

The unique ''Hello Kitty'' edition of the Mitsubishi i, which was on public display in Tokyo for one week before being auctioned for charity.

Special editions
A battery electric Mitsubishi i MiEV.
From July 25–31, 2006 the company displayed a unique ''Mitsubishi i Hello Kitty edition'' at the Mitsukoshi department store in Tokyo's Nihonbashi district. Based on the two-wheel drive ''G'' model, it had a pink paint scheme with co-ordinated interior, &quot;Princess Kitty&quot; decals on the doors and windows, a ribbon decal on the roof, and themed headrests with small, feline ears. The car, which was described as &quot;the most quintessentially Japanese car...ever&quot; for fusing two of the country's cultural icons — Hello Kitty and ''keijidōsha'' — was eventually sold in a charity auction on behalf of UNICEF.;[http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/07/the-ultimate-kei-mitsubishi-i-hello-kitty-princess-kitty-edit/ &quot;The ultimate kei?

Mitsubishi has given the i a prominent role in the company's alternative propulsion research projects, developing a version using their ''MiEV (Mitsubishi innovative Electric Vehicle)'' technology in 2006 and exhibited at the 22nd International Battery, Hybrid and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Symposium &amp; Exposition in Yokohama.
