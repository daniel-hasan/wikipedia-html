;
The city represents the core of the Greater Southampton region, with a population of 228,600.; ; The city's name is sometimes abbreviated in writing to &quot;So'ton&quot; or &quot;Soton&quot;, and a resident of Southampton is called a :Category:People from Southampton|Sotonian.;; 

;
Southampton is noted for being the home of the ''RMS Titanic'',; ; the ''Spitfire''; ; and more recently a number of the largest cruise liners in the world.; ;; ; 

History

Part of The Medieval Walls
Although Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements are known to have existed in the area,;; the first permanent settlement was established by the Romans shortly after their invasion of Britain in AD43.;; Known as ''Clausentum'', it was an important trading port for the large Roman towns of Winchester and Salisbury. The Romans abandoned the settlement circa AD410;;, and the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons eventually saw the formation of a new settlement circa AD700 across the Itchen centred around what is now the St Mary's area. The settlement was known as ''Hamwic'',;; which evolved into ''Hamtun'' and then ''Hampton''.;; 

The Viking King Canute the Great is supposed to have defeated the Anglo-Saxon King Ethelred the Unready here in 1014 and been crowned here, and his fabled attempt to &quot;command&quot; the tide to halt may have taken place in Southampton.;; Excavations have uncovered one of the best collections of Saxon artifacts in Europe.;;

Hamwic fell into decline in the 9th century,;; but there is evidence that by the 10th century, a new settlement, which became Medieval Southampton had already been established;; following the Norman Conquest in 1066. Southampton became the major port of transit between Winchester (then the capital of England) and Normandy.By the 13th Century, Southampton had become a leading port, and was particularly involved in the trade of French Wine;; in exchange for English cloth and wool.;; The ''Wool House'' was built in 1417 as a warehouse for the medieval wool trade with Flanders and Italy, the building surviving today as the Maritime Museum.During the Middle Ages, shipbuilding became an increasingly important industry, which was to remain for centuries to come.

English Channel naval campaign, 1338-1339|The town was sacked in 1338 by the French, including the pirate Grimaldi, who used the plunder to help found the principality of Monaco.;; After this attack, the city's walls - part of which dates from 1175;; - were extensively added to and reinforced.;; A large part of the town's walls remain today.;; Lacking proper finance for the construction of a full defensive wall, the townsfolk reached a compromise solution, which involved joining the existing exterior walls of existing merchant houses together to form part of the defensive structure. The city walls include ''God's House Tower'', built in 1417, the first purpose-built artillery fortification in England.;[http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/museum_gfx_en/SE000276.html 24 hour museum:God's House Tower Museum of Archaeology, Southampton] Accessed 1st August 2007; Over the years it has been used as home to the city's gunner, the Town Gaol and even as storage for the Southampton Harbour Board.;; Today, it is open as the Museum of Archaeology. The walls were finally completed in the 15th century.;;

The 12th century Red Lion pub on the High Street, within the old walls, is where in 1415, immediately prior to King Henry V of England's departure from Southampton to the Battle of Agincourt, the ringleaders of the &quot;Southampton Plot&quot;, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham and Sir Thomas Grey (1384-1415)|Thomas Grey of Heton, were tried and found guilty of high treason, before being summarily executed outside the Bargate.

The port was the original point of departure for the Pilgrim Fathers aboard the ''Mayflower'' in 1620.;; A memorial can be found on Town Quay. Since that time it has been the last port of call for millions of emigrants who left the Old World to start a new life in the USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and other parts of the world.

The memorial to the engineers of the RMS ''Titanic''.In 1838, the docks were rebuilt and Southampton became known as ''The Gateway to the Empire''.;; As was common with most of the luxury liners of the time,;; in 1912 the RMS ''Titanic'' sailed from here.;; The city contains several memorials and museum exhibitions related to the ''Titanic'', most of crew having come from Southampton; 549 Sotonians died in the sinking.

The CenotaphThe city is home to Sir Edwin Lutyens' first permanent cenotaph, which was the basis for his design of the memorial in Whitehall, London.;; a memorial to the city's dead of World War I. When it was unveiled on 6 November 1920, it was 1800 names, later raised to 2008.The Second World War hit Southampton particularly hard because of its strategic importance as the major industrial area on the South Coast.In particular, the Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft was invented and manufactured in Southampton, a result of 1930s experimentation in the city. Bombing in two days in September 1940 killed 130 workers at the Woolston aircraft factory. There were many aircraft companies based around Hamble-le-Rice|Hamble, to the east of the city, from the 1930s to 1950s, including Folland Aviation, now part of British Aerospace, which built the Hawk and Harrier. BOAC had a flying boat base in the docks serving British colonial possessions in Africa and Asia in the 1930s and 1940s. It closed in 1950 when land based aircraft became dominant. Nearby, Calshot Spit was a base for the military flying boat services. 

Pockets of Georgian architecture survived the war, but much of the city was levelled. The accuracy of the locally-based Ordnance Survey's maps did not go unrecognised by the Luftwaffe: the German bomber pilots used them to bomb Southampton.;; One notable building to survive the bombings was Southampton's oldest, St. Michaels Church. Thought to have been commenced in 1070,;http://www.hants.org.uk/sotoncitycentreparish/stmichael.htm - Retrieved 2004-04-08; the building has been added to many times over the centuries but its central tower dates from Norman times. The spire was an important navigation aid for the German pilots and consequently they were ordered to avoid bombing it.;http://www.wcities.com/en/record/,120885/206/record.html?event_name=&amp;display=1 - Retrieved 2004-04-08;

Southampton became a county corporate in 1447.It was one of the boroughs reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.The town became a county borough under the Local Government Act 1888, being expanded by the addition of several parishes in 1894, 1920, 1925 and 1967.Southampton was awarded city status in 1964 by Letters Patent.;''City Status for Southampton''. The Times. February 12, 1964.;The boundaries have been largely unchanged since then, despite the loss of county borough status in 1974, and subsequent regaining of unitary authority status in 1996.

Government
Civic Centre, Southampton Southampton used to be a County Borough within the county of Hampshire, which in the past was known as the ''County of Southampton''; ; or ''Southamptonshire''.; ; This was officially changed to ''Hampshire'' in 1959 although the county had been commonly known as Hampshire or Hantscire for centuries. Southampton became a non-metropolitan district in 1974. However, the city became independent administratively from that county as it was made into a unitary authority in a local government re-organisation on 1 April 1997 - a result of the 1992 Local Government Act. The district remains part of the Hampshire ceremonial county.

Southampton City Council consists of 48 councillors elected by thirds.After the 2007 local council elections on 3 May 2007the Council is split with 18 seats each to the Labour and the Conservative Party, each having gained two, and 12 to the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives are currently in control, after a Liberal Democrat resigned from her group to become an independent and voted for the Conservative leader Alec Samuels.

There are three members of parliament for the city: Rt Hon John Denham (Labour) for Southampton Itchen, the constituency for the east of the city, Dr Alan Whitehead (Labour) for Southampton Testwhich covers the west of the city, and Sandra Gidley (Liberal Democrat) for Romsey, which includes a northern portion of the city. The Boundary Commission for England has created the new constituency of Romsey and Southampton North, by enlarging the current Romsey one. The new boundaries encompass the unitary authority wards of Bassett and Swaythling. It will be in place in time for the 2009 or 2010 General Election.

Southampton's police service is provided by Hampshire Constabulary, its fire service by Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service and the ambulance service by the South Central Ambulance Service.Police stations within the city boundaries can be found in Portswood, Bitterne, and Shirley, as well as at the Civic Centre in the city centre.Fire stations are located in St Mary's, Sholing and Redbridge.

Geography and climate
The geography of Southampton is very much influenced by the sea and rivers. The city sits at the northern tip of the Southampton Water, a deepwater estuary, which is a ria formed at the end of the last Ice Age. Here, the rivers Test and Itchen converge.;''The Port of Southampton''
L. E. Tavener
Economic Geography, Vol. 26, No. 4 (Oct., 1950), pp. 260-273; The Test - which has saltmarsh that make it ideal for Salmon fishing; ; -runs along the Western edge of the city, while the Itchen splits Southampton in two - east and west. The city centre is located on the peninsula between the two rivers.

Much of the Waterfront has been reclaimed over the years, mainly for use as the Western Docks.; ; Most of the land used for reclamation came from dredging of Southampton Water,; ; to ensure that the port can continue to handle some of the largest ships in the world. The shape of the coastline gives rise to a natural phenomena in Southampton, known as the double tide.; ; This gives the port a much longer high tide period than other ports, making the movement of large ships easier.; ;; ;

The city itself lies in the Hampshire Basin, which sits atop large amounts of chalk beds.;''The Port of Southampton''

Hampshire County Council expects the city's population to grow by around a further two per cent between 2006 and 2013, adding around another 4,200 to the total number of residents.;; The highest increases are expected among the elderly.;;

Economy
Containers being loaded at the docks
There are currently 120,305 jobs in Southampton, and 3,570 people claiming job seekers allowance, approximately 2.4 per cent of the city's population, as of March 2007.; ; This compares with an average of 2.5 per cent for England as a whole.

As of June 2006, 74.7 per cent of the city's population are classed as economically active. ; ;

Southampton has always been strongly connected with maritime history and developments, and the docks have long been a major employer in the city. In particular, it is a primary port for cruise ships, its heyday being the first half of the 20th century, and in particular the inter-war years, when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the UK. Today it remains home to many luxury liners, as well as being the largest freight port on the Channel coast, with several container terminals.Unlike many other ports, such as Liverpool, London, and Bristol, where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry.Part of the docks have been redeveloped, however as the Ocean Village development, a local marina and entertainment complex. 

During the latter half of the 20th century, a more diverse range of industry also came to the city, including aircraftand automobile manufacture, cables, electrical-engineering products, and petrochemicals. These now sit alongside the city's traditional industries of the docks, grain milling, and tobacco processing.; ;

Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust is one of the city's largest employers. It provides local hospital services to half a million people in the Southampton area and specialist regional services to more than three million people across the South of England. The Trust owns and manages Southampton General Hospital, the Princess Anne Hospital and a palliative care service at Countess Mountbatten House.

Other major employers in the city include Ordnance Survey, the UK's national mapping agency, whose headquarters are in the city. The Lloyd's Register Group has announced plans to move its London marine operations to a specially developed site at the University of Southampton.;; The area of Swaythling is home to Ford's Southampton Assembly Plant, where the majority of their Transit models are manufactured.

West Quay Shopping Centre Southampton's largest retail centre is the West Quay Shopping Centre. Opened in September 2000 and hosting major High Street brands it is one of the largest in the country.The centre itself was phase two of the West Quay development. The first was the West Quay Retail park, while the third phase has been planned for a number of years with the latest target of work starting being 2007. The plans include building more shops, housing, offices including the headquarters for Carnival Cruises and additional leisure facilities. A decision as to what leisure facilities is still to be decided, however Southampton has been granted a large casino licence;; and so can now add to its collection of casinos in the city. 

Swedish low-cost home products retailer IKEA has been given permission to open a store in the city centre;;;; near to West Quay. Other major shopping areas in the city centre include The Mall Marlands, The Bargate Centre and the East Street area, which has been designated for speciality shopping, with the aim of promoting smaller retailers. Overall, Southampton is ranked 13th for shopping in the UK. ;;

The dockyards on the River TestLike many cities in the UK, Southampton's strong economy is promoting redevelopment, and major projects are proposed, including the city's first skyscrapers on the waterfront. The three towers proposed will each stand 23 stories high and will be surrounded by smaller apartment blocks, office blocks and shops.There are also plans for a 15 storey Hotel at the Ocean Village marina,;; and a 21 storey hotel on the north eastern corner of the city centre, as part of a £100m development.;;

Another project would have been the permanent docking of the ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' in Southampton (her home port since 1969) as a floating hotel and tourist attraction when she is retired;;; however, Cunard Line announced on June 18, 2007, that the ship will be sold to Dubai for those purposes.;;

Southampton is unique in being the only city in the UK with a geothermal power station. The station provides hot water to a city centre district heating scheme.In a recent survey of carbon emissions in major UK cities conducted by British Gas, Southampton was ranked as being one of the lowest carbon emitting cities in the United Kingdom.;;

According to figures from 2004, Southampton contributes around £4.2bn to the regional economy annually. The vast majority of this is from the service sector, with the remainder coming from industry in the city. This figure has almost doubled since 1995. ;;

There is also a door to door minibus service called Southampton Dial a Ride, for residents who cannot access public transport. This is funded by the council and operated by SCA Support Services.

Southampton Ferry Port

Southampton had been a railways port brfore the turn of the last century. Ships had sailed from the inner and outer dock to Le Havre, Cherbourg, St Malo and the Channel Islands for years. In the early 1960's a new wave of tourist arrived, the one that wants to take his car with him. Southampton realised that the days of the conventional car ferry were limited and looked to develop a ferry port. The old Inner dock was filled in. It was no longer big enough for much commercial shipping and being tidal was now becoming an issue. The entrance to the PAD (Princess Alexandra Dock, (the old outer dock)) was widened, this in itself removed two old berths No4 and No5. A link span was installed on No7 berth and No1 became the sea wall where the lock was, berth No2 and No3 were rotated round 90 degrees and a new pier constructed on an east-west axis and dry dock number 1 filled in. This shows an active port..;http://www.plimsoll.org/Southampton/TheDocks/EasternDocks/OuterDock3.asp The result appeared to be very successful] Accessed 2nd jan 2008;

No9	Was a very small corner berth and was not used 	

Originally use of the PAD was higher than expected with a number of shipping companies using the facilities and opening (optimistically) a number of routes to the Spanish and Portuguese ports. All of these came and went leaving only Townsend Thoreson and P&amp;O using Southampton. Townsend Thoreson would move passenger operations to Portsmouth in the late 1980's and all freight service across slightly later. The final act in the PAD was when P&amp;O transferred to Portsmouth all its services. The ambitious Continental ferry port had closed after only just over 20 years of use. The land was sold off and a retail/housing development was built on the site. The PAD was not in-filled but converted into a non-tidal Marina. The retail development itself failed and was demolished after only 10 years to make way for more housing and the site has been regenerated.

Other Berths 

No30 The origins of this berth, why this was built or who used it originally are unclear. It is designated as a common user berth. It was used by Townsend Thoreson in the late 1980's with their larger freighters Europic Ferry, Gaelic Ferry and the chartered Stena Ionia. It was later used by Stena in the 1990's- see below.

No49 This was the first link span built in Southampton and knowledge of the orignal users is unclear but it was used at a later stage by Seagull Ferries. They ran the St Christophe and St George to Le Harve in the early 1970's . It was located in a poor position with little marshalling ground and was seldom ever used. It is still there and used for car parking now.


Stena Sealink returned to Southampton in the 1991 with the former St Nicholas now renamed the Stena Normandy running to Cherborug on a one round trip a day basis. She was supplemented by the introduction of the Stena Challenger for additional freight capacity. Once again ABP invested a significant amount in the hope that Stena would be able to establish themselves, but the ships were often empty and the service was short lived lasting 5 years closing in 1996. They used the existing facilities at No30 berth and an additional linkspan created in the Empress dock. Both now lie largly unused.

Although Southamptons time as a ferry port was brief it now is the UK largest importer of cars and the new car reception areas now fill the eastern docks where passengers, dry docks and trains used to be.

Areas and suburbs
Council tower blocks in Weston

Southampton is subdivided into several council wards, suburbs, constituencies, ecclesiastical parishes, and other less formal areas.

Southampton is named the 'Green City' as it is graced with many green spaces and parks. The largest green space is the 148 hectare Southampton Common,; ; parts of which are used to host the annual summer festivals, circuses and fun fairs. The Common includes a wildlife centre on the former site of Southampton Zoo, a swimming pool and several lakes and ponds.

As with most cities there are several council estates such as those in the Weston, Thornhill and Townhill Park districts. Overall, the city is ranked 96th most deprived out of all 354 Local Authorities in England.; ;

Subdivisions of the city include:
* Bassett, Bassett Green, Bevois Valley, Bitterne, Bitterne Park, Bitterne Manor
* City Centre, Chartwell Green, Chilworth, Coxford

During the 2006/07 financial year, 1,267 residential dwellings were built in the city - the highest number for 15 years. Over 94 per cent of these properties were flats.; ;

Notable people

:''See also: :Category:People from Southampton''

There have been a number of notable people who either hail from Southampton or who have lived in the city over the years.
In the sphere of music, the city is the home of Coldplay drummer, Will Champion, whose father; ; and late mother; ; taught at the university. R&amp;B singer Craig David was brought up on the Holy Rood estate in the city centre, and BBC Radio One DJ Scott Mills comes from the city too. In the past, the city was home to Isaac Watts, a famous hymn writer, who notably composed ''O God Our Help In Ages Past'' which is the school hymn of theKing Edward VI school in the city and the peal of the Civic Centre clock tower. In other arts, Sir John Everett Millais, who now has a museum named after him in the city came from Southampton as did Benny Hill, the internationally renowned comedian, who had a milk round in nearby Eastleigh - the inspiration for his song ''Ernie (The Fastest Milkman In The West)''. SKY, &amp; International Radio Presenter Andy Collins and naturalist TV presenter Chris Packham are natives too.
