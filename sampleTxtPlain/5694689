Background
The process of creating the song began in the recording studio one morning at around 4:00 a.m., when Timbaland recommended that Furtado go home because she was tired. Furtado, who had heard that the band U2 wrote many of their songs in the studio control room, said &quot;Really? I'll show you&quot;, put on her hoodie and began to &quot;jam&quot;.;Scaggs, Austin. [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10603268/why_is_nelly_furtados_new_album_so_loud &quot;Why Is Nelly Furtado's New Album So Loud?&quot;]. ''Rolling Stone''. June 19 2006. Retrieved December 30 2006.; Nate Hills and Timbaland soon joined her, writing and producing as they went, and according to Furtado this process intensified as she sang. The team used four microphones in the live room and moved them around during recording, about which Furtado said, &quot;...when you listen to it &amp;mdash; there's a lot of dimension. It kind of sounds like [Timbaland]'s in another country&quot;.; Afterwards they picked the best vocals and &quot;perfected&quot; them, before inserting &quot;reverbs and weird alien sounds&quot; onto them. &quot;[W]e experimented a lot with depth and different sounds&quot;, Furtado said of the making of the song. &quot;[It] affected my vocals a whole lot.&quot;; 

Furtado has cited the &quot;spooky, keyboard-driven pop sound&quot; of the band Eurythmics, particularly their song &quot;Here Comes the Rain Again&quot; (1983), as an influence on &quot;Say It Right&quot; and other tracks on ''Loose''. &quot;I'm not 100 percent sure what [&quot;Here Comes the Rain Again&quot; is] about, but it always takes me away to another place, and I love it&quot;, she said.;[http://umusic.ca/nellyfurtado/ &quot;Nelly Furtado&quot;]. Universal Music Canada. Retrieved December 30 2006.; She said that she does not really know what &quot;Say It Right&quot; is about, &quot;but it captures the feeling I had when I wrote it, and it taps into this other sphere.&quot;; The song is written in F minor.

The song is featured on the U.S. compilation album ''Now That's What I Call Music! 24 (U.S. series)|Now 24'' and the UK compilation album ''Now That's What I Call Music! 66 (U.K. series)|Now 66''. Bloc Party covered the song on Jo Whiley's radio show on April 11, 2007.;; The song was played during the Miss Universe 2007 Introductory Ceremony,;
; the 2006 American Music Awards, ; and Concert for Diana.;; When the song is played live, the guitar solo at the end is extended and somewhat brought to life. On the studio version, the solo is short and repetitive.

Critical reception
''Billboard'' magazine called the song &quot;a Pussycat Dolls-inspired contempo jam, high on hooks and of-the-moment production. Well done, if in the most generic sense.&quot;;[http://music.monstersandcritics.com/reviews/article_1226822.php/Single_Reviews_Chris_Daughtry_Avril_Lavigne_Brooks_&amp;_Dunn_Nelly_Furtado_Hinder &quot;Single Reviews: Chris Daughtry, Avril Lavigne, Brooks &amp; Dunn, Nelly Furtado, Hinder&quot;].

He described the song as &quot;the foundation of ''Loose''&quot; and &quot;a welcomed presence in the pop top 40&quot;.;; IGN Music calls the song &quot;...one of the brightest moments on the album&quot; and &quot;another throwback to the '80s&quot; which &quot;...lets loose with the most hypnotic chorus&quot;.;; ''All Music Guides Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered the song &quot;a dark meditative piece that would have fit on [Furtado's] previous records&quot;.;;
