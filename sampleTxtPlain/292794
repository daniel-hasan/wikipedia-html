Biography
=Early life=
Gibson was born in Watts, Los Angeles, California, where he attended Locke High School. His mother, Priscilla Murray Gibson (née Durham), raised him and his three older siblings as a single parent after Gibson's father left in 1983.;; Gibson's career began when he won a talent show at the age of fourteen. An appearance in a 1997 Coca-Cola advertisement, singing the phrase &quot;Always Coca-Cola&quot;,;; led to wider fame, and at the age of seventeen his chiseled looks paved the way for him to model for Tommy Hilfiger. In regards to beefing up, he told CraveOnline that he does &quot;just a few push ups here and there... I’m doing push ups and eating Ding Dongs. That’s it, man. Twinkies, got to keep it right.&quot;;;

=Career=
Initially an MC, Gibson rapped under the alias of ''Black-Ty'' and was a member of an underground group known as ''Triple Impact'',; but didn't hesitate to follow another career route as an opportunity to launch his R&amp;B career came up first. He released his self-titled debut music album, which went platinum, in 1998;; his second album, ''2000 Watts'', shares the name of the organization he founded to help inner city children. Tyrese sang background vocals in Tupac's &quot;Never Call You Bitch Again&quot;. Tyrese also co-wrote with Teddy Riley and Michael Jackson the song &quot;2000 watts&quot;, included in Michael Jackson's 2001 album &quot;Invincible&quot;.

Gibson was given the role originally intended for Tupac Shakur in the 2001 film ''Baby Boy''; the movie was somewhat of a success for him. Gibson subsequently appeared in the 2003 box office success ''2 Fast 2 Furious'' (opposite Paul Walker), as well as ''Flight of the Phoenix'' (2004), ''Four Brothers'' (2005) and ''Annapolis'' (2006), co-starring James Franco.

In 2006, Gibson starred in ''Waist Deep'', in which he played a man fighting to rescue his son from kidnappers; his co-stars in the film, Meagan Good and Larenz Tate, are personal friends of Gibson's in real life.; Like several of his previous roles, the film is set in an urban environment, but Gibson has said that he does not view the role as a &quot;step back&quot;, rather seeing the film as taking &quot;another direction&quot; due to some of its themes and action sequences.;

His most recent role was in the big-budget action movie, ''Transformers'', which was released in July 2007; the film's director, Michael Bay, had Gibson in mind for the role before he was cast, and thus Gibson did not have to audition for the part.;; Gibson may also star in a film version of the superhero Luke Cage; as of 2006, the script was being re-formatted.;

Gibson prefers his music career to acting,; but will focus on both areas. His rap persona was finally revitalized on December 12,2006, with the release of his newest album, titled ''Alter Ego'', with one disc featuring R&amp;B (as Tyrese) and one disc featuring hip hop (as Black-Ty).; 
In 2007, Tyrese decided that he would like to be an independent recording artist and got out his contract with J Records. This is the first time in his musical career in which he was not signed to a label. However, he is being heavily approached by numerous different record labels. 

He has also started his own company, [http://www.hqent.net Headquarter Entertainment]. This is a multi-faceted company, and features new artist [http://www.hqent.net/lifenine/index.html Life Nine] and his producers The Frontline Boyz.

Gibson was picked as one of People Magazine's ''Sexiest Men of the Year'' in 2000.

=TGT=
