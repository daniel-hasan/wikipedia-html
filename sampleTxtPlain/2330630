, meaning &quot;spiritually positive gentle person system of martial arts&quot;, is a form of Kempo founded by William Durbin in 1982. It is a Gendai Budō martial art in the James Mitose lineage intended to provide for all aspects of self defense. Its Hombu Dojo, or headquarters, is in Frankfort, Kentucky.It currently has nine dojo throughout the southern and midwestern United States.

History

=William Durbin=
The founder of Kiyojute Ryu Kempo, William Durbin began his martial arts studies in Bardstown, Kentucky with instructor Richard Stone, originally learning Kodokan Judo.When he left for college in 1971, he along with Bob Sester (a Shotokan Karate student), and Bos Bosmar (also with the Kodokan) started Campbellsville College Martial Arts Club at Campbellsville University;McKinney, Joah (October, 2005). [http://www.campbellsville.edu/news/images/cvilliansept05.pdf &quot;Tiger Tracks&quot;]. ''The Campbellsvillian'', p. 21;.During these years, he studied a number of martial arts including; Shotokan Karate, Kodakan Judo, Goju Ryu, Shorin-ryu, Aikikai Aikido, Tae Kwon Do, Hapkido, and Tai Chi Chuan. 

Mastering Kempo by William DurbinIn 1974, while teaching self defense in Michigan, he coined the phrase &quot;Ki Yang Ju Te&quot;, to reflect a teaching philosophy toward the martial arts he was developing.In 1978, he (along with Richard Stone) joined with Rod Sacharnoski of Juko Kaiand began to study with Bill &quot;Superfoot&quot; Wallace, a master of Shorin-ryu Karate and the World Middleweight Full Contact Karate Champion.After joining Juko Kai, William Durbin demonstrated his skill to Rod Sacharnoski and was granted rank in Juko Kai and started teaching Juko Kai using his philosophy.

In 1979, William Durbin moved to Frankfort and began to work as an instructor of martial arts at Kentucky State University and for the Kentucky State Police.He continued to work for Kentucky State University throughout the early 1980s ;Durbin, William (2004). ''Koga Ryu Ninjutsu''. Boulder, CO. ISBN 1-58160-459-9}, p 27.;.
In 1980, Durbin was awarded his Shihan ranking from Juko Kai in Kempo.Also in 1980 he experienced what he describes as a ''Tenshin Sho'', a &quot;divine illumination&quot; where his perspective on religion and his practice of martial arts changed.Instead of being a minister who practiced martial arts, he now considered himself a &quot;martial arts minister&quot;;Paladin Press (November, 2004). [http://www.paladin-press.com/authormo_1104.aspx &quot;Author of the Month William Paul Durbin Jr.&quot;]. Paladin Press.Retrieved on 2007-7-9;.He was encouraged by Sacharnoski to pursue this further and began to develop a curriculum and codify his philosophies and teachings in preparations for opening his own school and founding his own system.He opened his dojo in Frankfort the next year in 1981 under the auspices of Juko Kai.

William Durbin has Shihan rank in Kempo, Karate, jujutsu, Aikijujutsu, Kobujutsu and a Sibak rank in Tai Chi Chuan through Juko Kai by Rod Sacharnoski, and a Shihan rank in Koga ha Kosho Shorei Ryu Ninjutsu under Nimr Hassan.He also has earned a 1st Dan rank in the Budo Taijutsu of the Bujinkan under Shidoshi John Willson ;, and a 1st Dan rank in Taekwondo;''Mastering Kempo''. Champaign, IL: ISBN 0-7360-0350-9, p 171;.He also holds a 3rd Dan rank in Kodokan Judo. ;Pedro, Jimmy and Durbin, William (2001). ''Judo Techniques and Tactics''. Chicago, IL: ISBN 0-7360-0343-6, pp 183.;.

In 2001, Durbin published ''Mastering Kempo'', a general textbook of Kempo history, philosophy and technique.Also in 2001 he co-wrote ''Judo Techniques and Tactics'' with Jimmy Pedro.In 2004 he wrote ''Koga Ryu Ninjutsu'', a book on the history and basic techniques of ninjutsu, and in 2007 he wrote ''Renzoku Ken: Combat Combinations of Kempo''.Since 1989 he has also written several dozen articles for various martial arts magazines, including ten articles published in Black Belt Magazine. ;Durbin, William.

=Creation of Kiyojute Ryu=
Between 1980 and 1982 William Durbin researched the history and techniques of martial arts in preparation for founding of a school, drawing on elements of each of the arts he studied, especially those arts he held Shihan ranking in.During this time, William Durbin was awarded an unaccredited Masters and Doctorate degree by Juko Kai through their University of Oriental Philosophy arm in Murphy, North Carolina.

In 1982 the Zen Kokusai Soke Budo/Bugei Remmei, a board operated by Juko Kai to recognize martial arts, acknowledged him as Shodai Soke (first generation headmaster) of Ki Yang Ju Te Ryu Kempo (In 1986, by request of William Durbin, the board reissued the certification under the proper Japanese romanization, Kiyojute Ryu).In 1986, Kiyojute Ryu opened its first dojo in Frankfort, as William Durbin's own dojo switched from officially being a Juko Kai dojo to being a Kiyojute Ryu dojo.

=Recognition and Endorsements=
William Durbin has written that he considers it very important that his students understand that he is not a &quot;self proclaimed&quot; Soke and that he is acknowledged by other members of the martial arts community as a legitimate headmaster of a Kempo system.To this end he has sought recognition from other prominent martial artists, especially those in the training lineage of James Mitose.

Thomas Mitose and Bruce Juchnik of Kosho Shorei Ryu Kempo and Nimr Hassan of Koga Ha Kosho Shorei-ryu (all students of James Mitose) have all given such recognition to Kiyojute Ryu.In addition, Bill Beach of Hawaiian Ju Jitsu;Durbin. ''Mastering Kempo''. Rear Cover.;, Bill &quot;Superfoot&quot; Wallace, and most recently, in 1999, Ramon Lono Ancho of Danzan-ryu|Kodenkan Danzan-ryu also recognized Kiyojute Ryu ;Durbin. ''Koga Ryu Ninjutsu''. p. 100;.

The back cover of his book ''Mastering Kempo'' includes quotes of endorsement from Bill Beach and Bill &quot;Superfoot&quot; Wallace as to the martial arts skill of William Durbin.Bill Wallace describes him as &quot;one of the leading practitioners of Kempo&quot; and Bill Beach describes him as &quot;I have studied his methods and worked and practiced with him for five years.His skills and abilities in the martial arts, especially Kempo, are fascinating.&quot; [https://www.humankinetics.com/products/showproduct.cfm?isbn=9780736003506] 

=Expansion=
The first dedicated Kiyojute Ryu dojo was opened in 1986, and as early as 1988 additional dojo began to open with Brad Gardone going on to open a dojo of Kiyojute Ryu at the University of Louisville and later a separate dojo in Louisville away from the University.;Kiyojute Ryu Kempo Bugei Clubs of Louisville. [http://www.louisvillekempo.com/LouisvilleClub.html] &quot;Louisville Club Dojo&quot;. Louisville Club Dojo.Retrieved on 2007-9-9;.In the 1990's several more dojo would open, including Lexington, Kentucky, Cleveland, Ohio, the University of Kentucky;;
, Urbana, Illinois, Chicago, Illinois and Cleveland, Ohio;;.In 2002 a dojo was opened in Hendersonville, Tennessee by a martial artist that had been a regular reader of William Durbin's magazine articles and books and sought him out for training.As Kiyojute Ryu Kempo is not operated as a business, dojo do not spread rapidly with a &quot;franchise&quot; mentality, instead they are typically founded as students with Dan ranks move to a new city that does not have a dojo and open one there.

Training
The instruction is in a family atmosphere, where students train as partners instead of adversaries. Training is relatively informal, with little ritual aside from formalized bowing to begin and end class and a formal ceremony involved with belt tests and promotions.This is done with the intention of recreating some elements of pre-Meiji era martial arts schools ;Pruitt, Robert (July, 2007). [http://arawakagekan.com/ask_bob/traditionalism &quot;Ask Bob: Is your martial art practiced in a traditional way?&quot;]. Arawa Kage Kan. Retrieved on 2007-7-9;. Part of the family atmosphere is the practice that its dojo are not widely distributed, and the Ryu does not aggressively expand, and there are only (as of 2007) around a dozen dojo, spread throughout Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois and Tennessee. Part of the atmosphere family and mutual respect of Kiyojute Ryu includes the members of the class hugging each other after class.;;Kiyojute Ryu Kempo has no &quot;tournament&quot; or &quot;sport&quot; aspects, and training for competitions is never conducted.
;;.

Another departure from the attitudes and training methods of most current martial arts schools is the free form of the Kiyojute Ryu, there are no fixed pre-set kata in Kiyojute Ryu Kempo.Students in Kiyojute Ryu are encouraged to adapt the techniques that they are taught to spontaneously respond to attacks in a free-form manner, using the techniques taught to them in the fashion which best fits their own body and style. This change of training in modernity, Kiyojute Ryu attributes to the development of the yakusoku kata (preset form) of practice created by Anko Itosu for the training of schoolchildren. Kiyojute Ryu teaches a freestyle kata wherein the student responds intuitively to imagined attacks, akin to shadowboxing.

=Hierarchy=
Kiyojute Ryu Kempo uses the ''dan-i'' ranking system of Kyu grades and Dan degrees.New students begin at 6th Kyu (White Belt), and progress through 5th Kyu (Yellow Belt), 4th Kyu (Green Belt) and 3rd through 1st Kyu (Brown Belt). Dan ranks wear the customary black belt, while those who have earned the title of Shihan (at least 5th Dan) wear a white and red belt, and those who have earned Hanshi title (at least 8th Dan) along with the Soke, Soke Dai and Shihanke wear a red belt. Provisions exist for the awarding of Menkyo Kaiden, primarily as a method of naming a Nidai (2nd Generation) Soke.

The uniforms of Kiyojute Ryu are the typical Gi of many martial arts schools. Either black or white gi are allowed, although most students and instructors wear black gi by tradition.A patch of the Kiyojute Ryu Tomoe is optionally worn on the left breast.

Titles
In addition to belt ranking, a system of traditional Japanese martial arts titles exists, from Sempai (Senior student but not an instructor) to Soke (the master of the entire ryu).Those who have earned a title have their title and first name embroidered on the ends of their belt in gold thread so that it is clear at a glance what their name and title is, for the benefit of new students to identify instructors and remember their names. Under normal conditions at least a first degree black belt and the title of Sensei is required to serve as an instructor. Each of these titles is considered to denote a different level of teaching responsibility and an increasing level of certain virtues treasured in Kiyojute Ryu Kempo: patience, benevolence, courage, and love.Sempai are aides to other instructors but not instructors themselves, while Sensei are considered able to instruct a student up to the point of being able to earn their 1st Dan, while a Kyoshi can prepare a student for higher Dan levels. ;Pruitt, Robert (January, 2007). [http://arawakagekan.com/ask_bob/titles &quot;Ask Bob: What's the Deal with all the titles?&quot;]. Arawa Kage Kan. Retrieved on 2007-7-9;Shihan are masters who are able to perform tests for ''kyu'' grades and the physical skills portion of tests for dan grades. The title of Shihanke (&quot;Master of the House&quot;) is above Shihan and Hanshi, but below the Soke and Soke Dai, but has never been awarded. A Shihanke would have the authority to award any kyu or dan grade. ;

Auxiliary Ranks
Within Kiyojute Ryu it is possible to engage in specialized instruction in the various arts that contributed to the formation of Kempo. After dedicated study, auxiliary ranks in Karate, jujutsu, Aikijujutsu, Kobujutsu, Nimpo, and Torite (also known as Toide or Karatejutsu) can be awarded.

Those students who pursue specialized instruction in kobujutsu and nimpo receive auxiliary ranks in the older menkyo system: Kiri Kami and Mokuroku (equivalent to Kyu ranks), Menkyo Sensei (equivalent to 1st Dan), Menkyo Renshi (equivalent to 2nd Dan), Menkyo Kyoshi (equivalent to 3rd Dan), Menkyo Shihan (equivalent to 5th Dan) and Menkyo Hanshi (equivalent to 8th Dan).

Rank requirements
For a student to test for higher rank (at kyu level), they must have completed at least 50 hours of dojo instruction, at least 6 hours must have been under an instructor of at least Shihan status, and they can test for belts no more often than every 6 months. Candidates for promotion to black belt ranks require at least 100 hours of instruction and can only test at most once a year (even less often for higher Dan ranks). Promotions to ranks above godan (5th Degree Black Belt) are only given at the discretion of the Soke, and not through normal testing.

Also, to earn a black belt a candidate must be at least 16 years of age and has earned 1st kyu brown belt or Ikkyu (as well as completed a year of training after earning ikkyu), thus requiring at a minimum of 3 and a half years of training before their test for shodan. Kiyojute Ryu does not allow individuals under 16 to earn black belts because choke holds are not taught to children under the age of 16, which leaves their training incomplete to take a black belt test; but they are instructed upon and are taught their chokes before they take there test when they turn 16. Furthermore, William Durbin has written that he considers children under the age of 16 too immature to hold a dan rank. In lieu of granting dan ranks to children, they are permitted to engage in study of auxiliary arts and earn kyu ranks in them until their 16th birthday. If they have earned 1st Kyu in more than one art by their 16th birthday, they may take 1st Dan tests in those arts when they reach 16 years of age.

=Techniques and curriculum=
The techniques of Kiyojute Ryu Kempo are a combination of karate, jujutsu, and aikijujutsu, with some elements of kobujutsu and Koppōjutsu. In theory, a student of Kiyojute Ryu should be skilled in a wide variety of weapons, unarmed attacks, grappling techniques, and other self-defense techniques. More advanced practitioners can pursue specialized instruction in the karate, jujutsu, aikijujutsu and kobjutsu.Ninjutsu (referred to as &quot;Nimpo,&quot; the patience principle, within Kiyojute Ryu) and Toide or Karatejutsu (referred to as &quot;Shuho&quot;, the taking principle) are also taught sparingly to advanced students.
;

Each promotion for kyu rank requires a student to learn at least three empty hand techniques (punches, elbow strikes or chops), two blocks, three kicks, three throws, two counterjoint techniques, a weapon, and to demonstrate a freestyle kata with unarmed combat. Dan rank promotions involve larger varieties of techniques, as well as specialized forms of kata and the ''mondo'', an oral examination by the Soke consisting of a personal discussion with him about the spiritual aspects of martial arts and a written reply to a set of philosophical questions.

The core weapons curriculum begins with the Hanbo, and proceeds to Bo and Nunchaku in the &quot;colored belt&quot; ranks, black belts study the yawara kobo, sai, tonfa, manriki-gusari and shuriken. Other traditional Japanese and Okinawan weapons, such as the katana, Jutte, Kusari Gama, Yari and Tsurugi are also taught, but to a lesser degree.The basic concept of weapons training in Kiyojute Ryu is that the principles learned wielding a wide variety of martial arts weapons can be applied to using everyday items such as a mop, pencil or belt as a weapon.;Pruitt, Robert (December, 2006). [http://arawakagekan.com/ask_bob/titles] &quot;Ask Bob, Why do you train with weapons like nunchaku and sai?&quot;. Arawa Kage Kan.Retrieved on 2007-7-9;.

Tai Chi Chuan is also taught to a minor extent of the normal curriculum, as performance of a Tai Chi form is required at the Dan rank levels. ;Durbin, William (1982) [http://arawakagekan.com/techniques &quot;Kiyojute Ryu List of Techniques&quot; ] Arawa Kage Kan. Retrieved on 2007-8-17; Tai Chi is also for the benefit of elderly students not physically capable of performing the throws and leaping techniques of the normal Kempo curriculum ;Durbin, William [http://kiyojuteryu.org:8084/soke/articles/taichi2.shtml &quot;Tsung Shih Tai Chi Chuan&quot; ].Kiyojute Ryu Kempo Website.Retrieved on 2007-8-17;

Unlike many other martial arts, there is no sparring (in the conventional sense) in Kiyojute Ryu Kempo.Like several other Japanese and Okinawan arts such as Shorinji Kempo, Kiyojute Ryu Kempo instead practices using ''Embu'', or &quot;Martial Demonstration&quot;, which it considers a revival of an older training method used in some places before modern sparring became popular.In Embu, after bowing to begin, the uke begins by attacking the tori, but intentionally pulling the punch just short of contact. Ideally, the tori learns targeting and control from this, and eventually throws full speed, full power strikes, precisely controlling their location so that they do not harm their uke (harming ones uke is grounds to immediately fail a promotion test in Kiyojute Ryu).The uke responds immediately after the attack is thrown by blocking, dodging or otherwise responding to the attack, and returning with their own counterattack. This cycle continues as long as the practitioners wish, although an Embu ends when the uke is thrown, choked, or counterjointed, and placed on the ground were the tori delivers a &quot;final blow&quot;, and the partners bow to end the exercises.Part of the defense-oriented philosophy of Kiyojute Ryu is that the aggressor (whoever throws the first punch) is the one who is defeated, so whoever begins the Embu with an attack is the one who is thrown in the end ;Durbin. ''Mastering Kempo''. p.118.;. Randori is also used in practicing akijujutsu and jujutsu techniques.

Philosophy and Religious Aspects
Kiyojute Ryu makes a point of being a martial art that combines mental, physical and spiritual aspects of training (the three parts of the tomoe are meant to symbolize this).Many of the differences from other arts come from the philosophy of its founder.As a Baptist minister, Durbin has tried to create an art that reflects his spiritual and moral values, and places an emphasis on self defense, compassion for ones fellow man, and responsible use of force rather than on aggression, destruction, or hurting others.Durbin is fond of noting that historically, great martial arts masters such as Morihei Ueshiba combined spiritual training along with physical training, and that many great masters were also clergy.

Durbin was inspired in what he describes as a ''Tenshin Sho'' or where he received a divine inspiration to teach the martial arts.His teachings and techniques were devised in an attempt to pass along this inspiration and as he describes it &quot;how to love and live at peace&quot;.He describes this in his writings as &quot;seeing the light&quot;.[http://kiyojuteryu.org:8084/soke/articles/kensho.shtml]

As an individual advances through the dan ranks, they are encouraged to grow spiritually and develop a personal relationship with God.All promotions within the black belt ranks require tests of spiritual and moral character as well as tests of physical skills.These tests consist of essays and private conversations (called mondo) with the head of the system on such issues as &quot;how can you improve your relationship with God?&quot;.Based on these conversations and essays, the head of the system decides how spiritually advanced the student is and promotions in rank and title are tied to the outcome of these tests.

=Kiyojute Philosophy=
Kiyojute Ryu Kempo is built on the philosophy developed by William Durbin in the 1970's.He coined the term &quot;Kiyojute&quot; to describe this philosophy of martial arts.The stated goal of Kiyojute Ryu is to train person through martial arts to have a closer relationship with God (however they perceive God in their religion of choice), a positive and healthy outlook on life, and to be gentle and compassionate in their actions with their fellow man, hence &quot;spiritually positive gentle hand/person&quot;.

In terms of self defense, the philosophy of Kiyojute Ryu is to safely end a situation as efficiently as possible (which means avoiding a confrontation wherever possible and using the minimum amount of force where it isn't) ;;.

While literally translated as &quot;Spiritually positive gentle hand&quot;, in official literature of Kiyojute Ryu they translate it as &quot;Spiritually positive gentle person&quot; using an uncommon double-meaning of the kanji &quot;手&quot; that normally means &quot;hand&quot; to mean &quot;person&quot;;Free Light Software.

=Christian Martial Arts Association=
While the Kiyojute philosophy itself is non-denominational, William Durbin is a Baptist minister and personally teaches Kempo from a Christian perspective and refers to his own dojo as the &quot;Christian Martial Arts Association&quot;, which is also the name of the non-profit organization that Kiyojute Ryu is legally incorporated as.While he personally teaches from a Christian perspective, he is open to teaching students of any religion.The following is from the Ryu's FAQ ;Durbin, William [http://kiyojuteryu.org:1084/faq/ Kiyojute Ryu Frequently Asked Questions] Kiyojute Ryu Kempo Website; and explains how religion is handled within the Ryu:



The belief that Christianity is not unlike other religions such as Buddhism for purposes of the spiritual growth required for advanced-level practitioners of martial arts is not a belief unique to Kiyojute Ryu, as Soke Masaaki Hatsumi of Bujinkan has written that the spiritual goals with regards of the martial arts of Christianity and Buddhism are the same.;Hatsumi, Masaaki (1988). ''The Grandmaster's Book of Ninja Training''. Chicago, IL: ISBN 0-8092-4692-5, pp 48.;
