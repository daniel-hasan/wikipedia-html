Constantine, son of Áed (Mediaeval Gaelic: ''Constantín mac Áeda''; Modern Gaelic: ''Còiseam mac Aoidh''), known in most modern regnal lists as Constantine II;Until the Victorian era, Constantine, son of Kenneth MacAlpin was listed as &quot;Constantine II of Scotland&quot;, and this Constantine as &quot;Constantine III&quot;. Since then, revised historical opinion has removed Caustantín of the Picts, previously titled &quot;Constantine I of Scotland&quot;, from the traditional list of Scottish monarchs, leading to this Constantine being retitled as &quot;Constantine II&quot;.;, nicknamed An Midhaise, &quot;the Middle Aged&quot;;Skene, ''Chronicles'', p. 91; Hudson, ''Celtic Kings'', p. 65.; (before 879&amp;ndash;952) was an early King of Scotland, known then by the Gaelic name ''Alba''. The Kingdom of Alba, a name which first appears in Constantine's lifetime, was in northern Britain. The core of the kingdom was formed by the lands around the River Tay. Its southern limit was the River Forth, northwards it extended at least to the Mounth, and perhaps to the River Spey, while its western limits are uncertain. Constantine's grandfather Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín) (died 858) was the first of the family recorded as a king, but as king of the Picts. This change of title, from king of the Picts to king of Alba, is part of a broader transformation of Pictland and the origins of the Kingdom of Alba are traced to Constantine's lifetime.

His reign, like those of his predecessors, was dominated by the actions of Viking rulers in Britain and Ireland, particularly the Uí Ímair (&quot;the grandsons of Ímar&quot;, or Ivar the Boneless). During Constantine's reign the rulers of the southern kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia, later the kingdom of England, extended their authority northwards into the disputed kingdoms of Northumbria. At first allied with the southern rulers against the Vikings, Constantine in time came into conflict with them. King Æthelstan was successful in securing Constantine's submission in 927 and 934, but the two again fought when Constantine, allied with the Strathclyde Britons and the Viking king of Dublin, invaded Æthelstan's kingdom in 937, only to be defeated at the great battle of Brunanburh. In 943 Constantine abdicated and retired to the Céli Dé (Culdee) monastery of St Andrews where he died in 952. He was succeeded by his predecessor's son Malcolm I (Máel Coluim mac Domnaill).

Constantine's reign of 43 years, exceeded in Scotland only by that of King William the Lion before the Union of the Crowns in 1603, is believed to have played a defining part in the gaelicisation of Pictland in which his patronage of the Irish Céli Dé monastic reformers was a significant factor. During his reign the words&quot;Scots&quot; and &quot;Scotland&quot; () are first used to mean part of what is now Scotland. The earliest evidence for the the ecclesiastical and administrative institutions which would last until Davidian Revolution also appears at this time.

Sources
Compared to neighbouring Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England, few records of ninth and tenth century events in northern Britain survive. The main local source from the period is the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'', a list of kings from Kenneth MacAlpin (died 858) to Kenneth II (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim, died 995). The list survives in the Poppleton Manuscript, a thirteenth century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added in the tenth and twelfth centuries.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 87&amp;ndash;93; Dumville, &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;.; In addition to this, later king lists survive.;Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', reproduces these lists and discusses their origins.; The earliest genealogical records of the descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin may date from the end of the tenth century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.;Broun, ''Irish Identity'', pp. 133&amp;ndash;164; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 220&amp;ndash;221.;

For narrative history the principal sources are the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' and the Irish annals. The evidence from charters created in the Kingdom of England provides occasional insight into events in northern Britain.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 2&amp;ndash;3, 87&amp;ndash;88, &amp; 357&amp;ndash;359.; While Scandinavian sagas describe events in 10th century Britain, their value as sources of historical narrative, rather than documents of social history, is disputed.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 277&amp;ndash;285; Ó Corrain, &quot;Vikings in Scotland and Ireland&quot;; Sawyer &amp; Sawyer, ''Medieval Scandinavia'', pp. 21&amp;ndash;26.; Mainland European sources rarely concern themselves with affairs in Britain, and even less commonly with events in northern Britain, but the life of Saint Cathróe of Metz, a work of hagiography written in Germany at the end of the tenth century, provides plausible details of the Saint's early life in north Britain.;MacQuarrie, ''Saints of Scotland'', pp. 199&amp;ndash;210.;

While the sources for north-eastern Britain, the lands of the kingdom of Northumbria and the former Pictland, are limited and late, those for the areas on the Irish Sea and Atlantic coasts&amp;mdash;the modern regions of north-west England and all of northern and western Scotland&amp;mdash;are non-existent, and archaeology and toponymy are of primary importance.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 12.;

Pictland from Constantín mac Fergusa to Constantine I

Recorded relationships within the early House of Alpin
The dominant kingdom in eastern Scotland before the Viking Age was the northern Pictish kingdom of Fortriu on the shores of the Moray Firth. By the ninth century, the Gaels of Dál Riata (Dalriada) were subject to the kings of Fortriu of the family of Constantín of the Picts|Constantín mac Fergusa (Constantine son of Fergus). Constantín's family dominated Fortriu after 789 and perhaps, if Constantín was a kinsman of Óengus I of the Picts (Óengus son of Fergus), from around 730. The dominance of Fortriu came to an end in 839 with a defeat by Viking armies reported by the ''Annals of Ulster'' in which King Uen of Fortriu and his brother Bran, Constantín's nephews, together with the king of Dál Riata, Áed mac Boanta, &quot;and others almost innumerable&quot; were killed.;''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 838.; These deaths led to a period of instability lasting a decade as several families attempted to establish their dominance in Pictland. By around 848 Kenneth MacAlpin had emerged as the winner.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 57&amp;ndash;67 &amp; 93&amp;ndash;98; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 180&amp;ndash;185; Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', pp. 8&amp;ndash;10; Bannerman, &quot;Scottish takeover&quot;; Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', pp. 107&amp;ndash;108.;

Later national myth made Kenneth MacAlpin the creator of the kingdom of Scotland, the founding of which was dated from 843, the year in which he was said to have destroyed the Picts and inaugurated a new era. The historical record for ninth century Scotland is meagre, but the Irish annals and the tenth century ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' agree that Kenneth was a Pictish king, and call him &quot;king of the Picts&quot; at his death. The same style is used of Kenneth's brother Donald I (Domnall mac Ailpín) and sons Constantine I (Constantín mac Cináeda) and Áed of Scotland|Áed (Áed mac Cináeda).;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 93&amp;ndash;117 &amp; 320&amp;ndash;322; Broun, &quot;Dunkeld&quot;; Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', pp. 13&amp;ndash;14; Herbert, &quot;''Ri Éirenn, Ri Alban''&quot;; Dumville, &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;, p. 76.;

The kingdom ruled by Kenneth's descendants&amp;mdash;older works used the name House of Alpin to describe them but descent from Kenneth was the defining factor, Irish sources referring to ''Clann Cináeda meic Ailpín'' (&quot;the Clan of Kenneth MacAlpin&quot;) ;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 220&amp;ndash;221 &amp; 256&amp;ndash;257; Broun, ''Irish Identity'', pp. 173&amp;ndash;174;&amp;mdash;lay to the south of the previously dominant kingdom of Fortriu, centred in the lands around the River Tay. The extent of Kenneth's nameless kingdom is uncertain, but it certainly extended from the Firth of Forth in the south to the Mounth in the north. Whether it extended beyond the mountainous spine of north Britain&amp;mdash;Druim Alban&amp;mdash;is unclear. The core of the kingdomwas similar to the old counties of Mearns, Forfar, Perth, Fife, and Kinross-shire|Kinross. Among the chief ecclesiastical centres named in the records are Dunkeld, probably seat of the bishop of the kingdom, and ''Cell Rígmonaid'' (modern St Andrews).;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 98&amp;ndash;101; Driscoll, ''Alba'' pp. 33&amp;ndash;51; Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', pp. 8 fig. 1, 39 fig. 24., &amp; 110&amp;ndash;111.;

Kenneth's son Constantine died in 876, probably killed fighting against a Viking army which had come north from Northumbria in 874. According to the king lists, he was counted the 70th and last king of the Picts in later times.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 106&amp;ndash;116; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 72&amp;ndash;75, s.a. 875. For Constantine as the last Pictish king, the original count being 66 kings, see Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 124&amp;ndash;126; Broun, ''Irish Identity'', p. 168&amp;ndash;169; Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', pp. 78&amp;ndash;79.;

Britain and Ireland at the end of the ninth century
Some locations in northern Britain, late 9th and early 10th centuries. The dotted line marked A represents the southern boundary of the Kingdom of Alba, c. 890&amp;ndash;950. The dotted line marked B represents the southern boundary of the Kingdom of Strathclyde, c. 925&amp;ndash;945.
In 899 Alfred the Great, king of Wessex, died leaving his son Edward the Elder as ruler of Britain south of the River Thames and his daughter Æthelflæd and son-in-law Æthelred, ealdorman of Mercia|Æthelred ruling the western, English part of Mercia. The situation in the Danish kingdoms of eastern Britain is less clear. King Eohric was probably ruling in East Anglia, but no dates can reliably be assigned to the successors of Guthfrith of York in Northumbria. It is known that Guthfrith was succeeded by Sigurd and Cnut, although whether these men ruled jointly or one after the other is uncertain. Northumbria may have been divided by this time between the Viking kings in York and the local rulers, perhaps represented by Eadulf, based at Bamburgh who controlled the lands from the River Tyne or River Tees to the Forth in the north.;Keynes, &quot;Rulers of the English&quot;, pp. 504&amp;ndash;505; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 138&amp;ndash;139; Blair, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 75&amp;ndash;79.;

In Ireland, Flann Sinna, married to Constantine's aunt Máel Muire, was dominant. The years around 900 represented a period of weakness among the Vikings and Norse-Gaels of Dublin. They are reported to have been divided between two rival leaders. In 894 one group left Dublin, perhaps settling on the Irish Sea coast of Britain between the River Mersey and the Firth of Clyde. The remaining Dubliners were expelled in 902 by Flann Sinna's son-in-law Cerball mac Muirecáin, and soon afterwards appeared in western and northern Britain.;Annals of Ulster, s.a. 893 &amp; 902; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp 131 &amp; 138&amp;ndash;139.;

To the south-west of Constantine's lands lay the kingdom of Strathclyde. This extended north into the Lennox, east to the River Forth, and south into the Southern Uplands. In 900 it was ruled by King Domnall I.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 153&amp;ndash;157.; 

The situation of the Gaelic kingdoms of Dál Riata in western Scotland is uncertain. No kings are known by name after Áed mac Boanta. The Frankish ''Annales Bertiniani'' may record the conquest of the Inner Hebrides, the seaward part of Dál Riata, by Northmen in 849.;Woolf, pp. 99&amp;ndash;100 &amp; 286&amp;ndash;289; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 277.; In addition to these, the arrival of new groups of Vikings from northern and western Europe was still commonplace. Whether there were Viking or Norse-Gael kingdoms in the Western Isles or the Northern Isles at this time is debated.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 275&amp;ndash;311, especially 286&amp;ndash;289; Ó Corrain, &quot;Vikings in Scotland and Ireland&quot;; Crawford, ''Scandinavian Scotland'', pp. 39&amp;ndash;62; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 141&amp;ndash;174.;

Early life
Áed of Scotland|Áed, Constantine's father, succeeded Constantine's uncle and namesake Constantine I in 876 but was killed in 878. Áed's short reign is glossed as being of no importance by most king lists. Although the date of his birth is nowhere recorded, Constantine II cannot have been born any later than the year after his father's death, that is 879. His name may suggest that he was born rather earlier, during the reign of his uncle Constantine I.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 116&amp;ndash;117, 124, &amp; 166, note 84.; 

After Áed's death there is a two decade gap until the death of Donald II (Domnall mac Constantín) in 900 during which nothing is reported in the Irish annals.;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 358&amp;ndash;358 &amp; 395; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 117&amp;ndash;118.; The entry for the reign between Áed and Donald II is corrupt in the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'', and in this case the ''Chronicle'' is at variance with every other king list.;On this, note Dumville's comments regarding damnatio memoriae, Dumville, &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;, p. 75; see also Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 117&amp;ndash;121.; According to the ''Chronicle'', Áed was followed by Eochaid, a grandson of Kenneth MacAlpin, who is somehow connected with Giric, but all other lists say that Giric ruled after Áed and make great claims for him.;Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', pp. 251&amp;ndash;252, 254, 263, 267, 274, 283, &amp; 288.; Giric is not known to have been a kinsman of Kenneth's, although it has been suggested that he was related to him by marriage. The major changes in Pictland which began at about this time have been associated by Alex Woolf and Archie Duncan with Giric's reign.;Duncan, pp. 11&amp;ndash;16; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 117&amp;ndash;121, 137&amp;ndash;138, &amp; 320&amp;ndash;322. For an alternative view of all this, see Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 215&amp;ndash;218.;

Woolf suggests that Constantine and his cousin Donald may have passed Giric's reign in exile in Ireland where their aunt Máel Muire was wife of two successive High Kings of Ireland, Áed Findliath and Flann Sinna.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 122&amp;ndash;125.; Giric died in 889. If he had been in exile, Constantine may have returned to Pictland where his cousin Donald II became king. Donald's reputation is suggested by the epithet ''dasachtach'', a word used of violent madmen and mad bulls, attached to him in the eleventh century writings of Flann Mainstreach, echoed by the his description in the ''Prophecy of Berchan'' as &quot;the rough one who will think relics and psalms of little worth&quot;.;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. cxlix &amp; 397&amp;ndash;398.; Wars with the Viking kings in Britain and Ireland continued during Donald's reign and he was probably killed fighting yet more Vikings at Dunnottar in the Mearns in 900. Constantine succeeded him as king.;Woolf, p. 125; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 395&amp;ndash;398. The account of the conquest of the kingdom of Strathclyde in Domnall's time given by, for example, Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 217&amp;ndash;218, is rejected by Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', p. 40, and Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 152&amp;ndash;157.;

Vikings and bishops
The cult of Saint Columba and its relics were associated with victory in battle. The ''Cathbuaid'', Columba's crozier or staff, has been lost but the eighth century ''Breccbennach'' or Monymusk Reliquary shown here, which held relics of Columba, is known to have been carried into battle from the reign of King William I onwards.;Yorke, ''The Conversion of Britain'', pp. 190&amp;ndash;191; Alcock, ''Kings and Warriors'', pp. 327&amp;ndash;329; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', p.136. See also the Cathach of St. Columba, a seventh century psalter to which similar powers were attributed.;
The earliest event recorded in the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' in Constantine's reign is an attack by Vikings and the plundering of Dunkeld &quot;and all Albania&quot; in his third year. This is the first use of the word Albania, the Latin form of the Old Irish ''Alba'', in the Chronicle which until then describes the lands ruled by the descendants of Cináed as Pictavia.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 122&amp;ndash;126; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 444&amp;ndash;446, where Albania is translated as Scotland; Broun, &quot;Dunkeld&quot;.;

These Northmen may have been some of those who were driven out of Dublin in 902, but could also have been the same group who had defeated Domnall in 900. The ''Chronicle'' states that the Northmen were killed in ''Srath Erenn'', which is confirmed by the ''Annals of Ulster'' which records the death of Ímar grandson of Ímar and many others at the hands of the men of Fortriu in 904. This Ímar was the first of the Uí Ímair, that is the grandsons of Ímar, to be reported; three more grandsons of Ímar appear later in Constantín's reign. The ''Fragmentary Annals of Ireland'' contain an account of the battle, and this attributes the defeat of the Norsemen to the intercession of Saint Columba following fasting and prayer. An entry in the ''Chronicon Scotorum'' under the year 904 may possibly contain a corrupted reference to this battle.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 127&amp;ndash;128 &amp; 130&amp;ndash;131; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 398, 399, &amp; 444&amp;ndash;446; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 902, 904; ''Chronicon Scotorum'', s.a. 902, 904; ''Fragmentary Annals'', FA 429.;

The next event reported by the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' is dated to 906. This records that:;King Constantine and Bishop Cellach I of Cennrígmonaid|Cellach met at the ''Hill of Belief'' near the royal city of Scone and pledged themselves that the laws and disciplines of the faith, and the laws of churches and gospels, should be kept ''pariter cum Scottis''.;After Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 445.;; The meaning of this entry, and its significance, have been the subject of debate.
The moot hill at Scone, perhaps the ''Hill of Belief'' of 906;Bannerman, &quot;Scottish Takeover&quot;, p. 79.;
The phrase ''pariter cum Scottis'' in the Latin text of the ''Chronicle'' has been translated in several ways. William Forbes Skene and Alan Orr Anderson proposed that it should be read as &quot;in conformity with the customs of the Gaels&quot;, relating it to the claims in the king lists that Giric liberated the church from secular oppression and adopted Irish customs.;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 445, note 1; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 135. This version is followed by Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 188&amp;ndash;189.; It has been read as &quot;together with the Gaels&quot;, suggesting either public participation or the presence of Gaels from the western coasts as well as the people of the east coast.;Driscoll, p. 37, translates the phrase in this way; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 135&amp;ndash;136.; Finally, it is suggested that it was the ceremony which followed &quot;the custom of the Gaels&quot; and not the agreements.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 136; see also Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', p. 188.;

The idea that this gathering agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has suggested that it was an important step in the gaelicisation of the lands east of Druim Alban.;Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 188&amp;ndash;189, writes that &quot;it marks the final triumph of the Gaelic order over the old Pictish order&quot;.; Others have proposed that the ceremony in some way endorsedConstantine's kingship, prefiguring later royal inaugurations at Scone.;Driscoll, ''Alba'', p. 37; Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', pp. 15&amp;ndash;16.; Alternatively, if Bishop Cellach was appointed by Giric, it may be that the gathering was intended to heal a rift between king and church.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 137&amp;ndash;138.;

Return of the Uí Ímair
Following the events at Scone, there is little of substance reported for a decade. A story in the ''Fragmentary Annals of Ireland'', perhaps referring to events some time after 911, claims that Queen Æthelflæd, who ruled in Mercia, allied with the Irish and northern rulers against the Norsemen on the Irish sea coasts of Northumbria. The ''Annals of Ulster'' record the defeat of an Irish fleet from the kingdom of Ulaid by Vikings &quot;on the coast of England&quot; at about this time.;Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', pp. 185&amp;ndash;186; ''Fragmentary Annals of Ireland'', FA 429; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 913.;

In this period the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' reports the death of Cormac mac Cuilennáin, king of Munster, in the eighth year of Constantine's reign.;The ''Annals of Ulster'' states that Cormac died on 13 September 908; Woolf, p. 127&amp;ndash;129.; This is followed by an undated entry which was formerly read as &quot;In his time Dynfwal [Domnall], king of the [Strathclyde] Britons died, and Domnall son of Áed was elected&quot;. This was thought to record the election of a brother of Constantine named Domnall (Donald) to the kingship of the Britons of Strathclyde and was seen as early evidence of the domination of Strathclyde by the kings of Alba. The entry in question is now read as &quot;...Dynfwal...and Domnall son Áed king of Ailech died&quot;, this Domnall being a son of Áed Findliath who died on 21 March 915.;Domnall's death is recorded by the ''Annals of Ulster''. For the re-reading by Benjamin Hudson, see Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 127&amp;ndash;129 &amp; 152&amp;ndash;157; Dumville, &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;, p. 77. Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 222&amp;ndash;223, is typical of the interpretation found in older works. The phrase in question reads &quot;''et Dunenaldus filius Ede elig;;7;;''&quot;.; Finally, the deaths of Flann Sinna and Niall Glúndub are recorded.;The ''Annals of Ulster'' record the death of Flann on 25 May 916 and that of Niall on 14 September 919; Woolf, p. 127&amp;ndash;129.; 

There are more reports of Viking fleets in the Irish Sea from 914 onwards.By 916 fleets under Sihtric Cáech and Ragnall ua Ímair|Ragnall, said to be grandsons of Ímar (that is, they belonged to the same Uí Ímair kindred as the Ímar who was killed in 904), were very active in Ireland. Sihtric inflicted a heavy defeat on the armies of Leinster and retook Dublin in 917.;Hart, &quot;Sihtric Cáech&quot;; Hart &quot;Ragnall&quot;; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 138&amp;ndash;141; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 914&amp;ndash;917.; The following year Ragnall appears to have returned across the Irish sea intent on establishing himself as king at York.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 142; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 918.; The only precisely dated event in the summer of 918 is the death of Queen Æthelflæd on 12 June 918 at Tamworth. Æthelflæd had been negotiating with the Northumbrians to obtain their submission, but her death put an end to this and her successor, her brother Edward the Elder, was occupied with securing control of Mercia.;Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', pp. 186&amp;ndash;188; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 105, Ms. C, s.a. 918, 919.;
Dere Street; Corbridge is just south of Hadrian's Wall in the centre of the map.
The northern part of Northumbria, and perhaps the whole kingdom, had probably been ruled by Ealdred son of Eadulf since 913.;Keynes, &quot;Rulers of the English&quot;; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 138&amp;ndash;141.; Faced with Ragnall's invasion, Ealdred came north seeking assistance from Constantine. The two advanced south to face Ragnall, and this led to a battle somewhere on the banks of the River Tyne, probably at Corbridge where Dere Street crosses the river. The battle of Corbridge appears to have been indecisive; the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' is alone in giving Constantine the victory.;There is disagreement as to whether there was one battle at Corbridge in the 910s or two. The ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 918, the ''Fragmentary Annals of Ireland'', and the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'', report only one battle. The idea that there were two rests on the ''Historia de Sancto Cuthberto'', for which see Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', p. 64. The question is discussed by Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 142&amp;ndash;144; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 332&amp;ndash;333.; 

The report of the battle in the ''Annals of Ulster'' says that none of the kings or mormaers among the men of Alba were killed. This is the first surviving use of the word mormaer; other than the knowledge that Constantine's kingdom had its own bishop or bishops and royal villas, this is the only hint to the institutions of the kingdom.;For Mormaers, see Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp 342&amp;ndash;350; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 219&amp;ndash;220. For the later institutions of the kingdom of Alba, see ;

After Corbridge, Ragnall enjoyed only a short respite. In the south, Alfred's son Edward had rapidly secured control of Mercia and had a burh constructed at Bakewell in the Peak District from which his armies could easily strike north. An army from Dublin led by Ragnall's kinsman Sihtric struck at north-western Mercia in 919, but in 920 or 921 Edward met with Ragnall and other kings. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' states that these king &quot;chose Edward as father and lord&quot;. Among the other kings present were Constantine, Ealdred son of Eadwulf, and the king of Strathclyde, either Domnall II or, more probably, Eógan I of Strathclyde|Eógan I. Here, again, a new term appears in the record, the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' for the first time using the word ''scottas'', from which Scots derives, to describe the inhabitants of Constantine's kingdom in its report of these events.;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 333&amp;ndash;335; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 104, Ms. A, s.a. 924; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 145&amp;ndash;147.;

Edward died in 924. His realms appear to have been divided with the West Saxons recognising Ælfweard of Wessex|Ælfweard while the Mercians chose Æthelstan who had been raised at Æthelflæd's court. Ælfweard died within weeks of his father and Æthelstan was inaugurated as king of all of Edward's lands in 925.;Keynes, &quot;Rulers of the English, p. 514; Miller, &quot;Æthelstan&quot;; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 339.;

Æthelstan
By 926 Sihtric had evidently acknowledged Æthelstan as over-king, adopting Christianity and marrying a sister of Æthelstan at Tamworth. Within the year he may have abandoned his new faith and repudiated his wife, but before Æthelstan and he could fight, Sihtric died suddenly in 927. His kinsman, perhaps brother, Gofraid ua Ímair|Gofraid, who had remained as his deputy in Dublin, came from Ireland to take power in York, but failed. Æthelstan moved quickly, seizing much of Northumbria. In less than a decade, the kingdom of the English had become by far the greatest power in Britain and Ireland, perhaps stretching as far north as the Firth of Forth.;Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', pp. 186&amp;ndash;190; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 339&amp;ndash;340;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp.148&amp;ndash;151; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 105 &amp; 107, Ms. D, s.a. 925, 926, Ms. E, F, s.a. 927.;

John of Worcester's chronicle suggests that Æthelstan faced opposition from Constantine, from Owain of Strathclyde, and from the Welsh kings. William of Malmesbury writes that Gofraid, together with Sihtric's young son Olaf Cuaran fled north and received refuge from Constantine, which led to war with Æthelstan. A meeting at Eamont Bridge on 12 July 927 was sealed by an agreement that Constantine, Eógan of Strathclyde, Hywel Dda, and Ealdred would &quot;renounce all idolatry&quot;: that is, they would not ally with the Viking kings. William states that Æthelstan stood godfather to a son of Constantine, probably Indulf (Ildulb mac Constantín), during the conference.;Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 66&amp;ndash;67; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p.107, Ms. D, s.a. 926; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 339&amp;ndash;340; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp 150&amp;ndash;152 &amp; 192&amp;ndash;193; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 201&amp;ndash;202; Miller, &quot;Æthelstan&quot;.;

Æthelstan followed up his advances in the north by securing the recognition of the Welsh kings.;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 340&amp;ndash;341.; For the next seven years, the record of events in the north is blank. Æthelstan's court was attended by the Welsh kings, but not by Constantine or Eógan of Strathclyde. This absence of record means that Æthelstan's reasons for marching north against Constantine in 934 are unclear.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 161&amp;ndash;165. The previous year had seen the death of Æthelstan's brother , perhaps drowned on the king's orders; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 107, Ms. E, s.a. 933 &amp; note 11; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 355&amp;ndash;356. The following year Gofraid died and was succeeded by his son Amlaíb, Constantine's son-in-law; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 934. Finally, the ''Annals of Clonmacnoise'' report the death of &quot;Adulf mcEtulfe, king of the North Saxons&quot; in the same year as Æthelstan's campaign; Woolf suggests that this may represent Ealdred, or some other son of Eadulf, ruling in Northumbria.;

Æthelstan's campaign is reported by in brief by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', and later chroniclers such as John of Worcester, William of Malmesbury, Henry of Huntingdon, and Symeon of Durham add detail to that bald account. Æthelstan's army began gathering at Winchester by 28 May 927, and reached Nottingham by 7 June. He was accompanied by many leaders, including the Welsh kings Hywel Dda, Idwal Foel, and Morgan ab Owain. From Mercia the army went north, stopping at Chester-le-Street, before resuming the march accompanied by a fleet of ships. Eógan of Strathclyde was defeated and Symeon states that the army went as far north as Dunnottar and Fortriu, while the fleet is said to have raided Caithness, by which a much larger area, including Sutherland, is probably intended. It is unlikely that Constantine's personal authority extended so far north, and while the attacks may have been directed at his allies, they may also have been simple looting expeditions.;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 107, Ms. D, s.a. 934; Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 67&amp;ndash;69; Miller, &quot;Æthelstan&quot;; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 342; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 160&amp;ndash;166; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', p. 203.;

The ''Annals of Clonmacnoise'' state that &quot;the Scottish men compelled [Æthelstan] to return without any great victory&quot;, while Henry of Huntingdon claims that the English faced no opposition. A negotiated settlement may have ended matters: according to John of Worcester, a son of Constantine was given as a hostage to Æthelstan and Constantín himself accompanied the English king on his return south. He witnessed a charter with Æthelstan at Buckingham on 13 September 934 in which he is described as ''subregulus'', that is a king acknowledging Æthelstan's overlordship.;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 426; Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 67&amp;ndash;69; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 166&amp;ndash;168; ; The following year, Constantine was again in England at Æthelstan's court, this time at Cirencester where he appears as a witness, appearing as the first of several subject kings, followed by Eógan of Strathclyde and Hywel Dda, who subscribed to the diploma.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 166&amp;ndash;168; only a part of this charter survives, see ; At Christmas of 935, Eógan of Strathclyde was once more at Æthelstan's court along with the Welsh kings, but Constantine was not. His return to England less than two years later would be in very different circumstances.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 167&amp;ndash;168.;

Brunanburh and after
Following his disappearance from Æthelstan's court after 935, there is no further report of Constantine until 937. In that year, together with Eógan of Strathclyde and Olaf Guthfrithson, King of Dublin, Constantineinvaded England. The resulting battle of Brunanburh&amp;mdash;''Dún Brunde''&amp;mdash;is reported in the ''Annals of Ulster'' as follows:;a great battle, lamentable and terrible was cruelly fought...in which fell uncounted thousands of the Northmen. ... And on the other side, a multitude of Saxons fell; but Æthelstan, the king of the Saxons, obtained a great victory.;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 428&amp;ndash;429; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 937.;; The battle was remembered in England a generation later as &quot;the Great Battle&quot;. When reporting the battle, the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' abandons its usual terse style in favour of a heroic poem vaunting the great victory. In this the &quot;hoary&quot; Constantine, by now around 60 years of age, is said to have lost a son in the battle, a claim which the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' confirms. The ''Annals of Clonmacnoise'' give his name as Cellach. For all its fame, the site of the battle is uncertain and several sites have been advanced, with Bromborough on the Wirral the most favoured location.;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 106&amp;ndash;110, Ms. A, s.a. 937; Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 69&amp;ndash;73; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 429; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', 168&amp;ndash;173; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp 203&amp;ndash;204; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 342&amp;ndash;343; Scragg, &quot;''Battle of Brunanburh''&quot;.;

Brunanburh, for all that it had been a famous and bloody battle, settled nothing. On 27 October 939 Æthelstan, &quot;pillar of the dignity of the western world&quot; in the words of the ''Annals of Ulster'', died at Malmesbury. He was succeeded by his brother Edmund the Elder, then aged 18. Æthelstan's empire, seemingly made safe by the victory of Brunanburh, collapsed in little more than a year from his death when Amlaíb returned from Ireland and seized Northumbria and the Mercian Danelaw. Edmund spent the remainder of Constantín's reign rebuilding the empire.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 174; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 356&amp;ndash;359; Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', p. 193; Blair, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 87&amp;ndash;89.;

For Constantine's last years as king there is only the meagre record of the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba''. The death of Æthelstan is reported, as are two others. The first of these, in 938, is that of Dubacan, mormaer of Angus or son of the mormaer. Unlike the report of 918, on this occasion the title mormaer is attached to a geographical area, but it is unknown whether the Angus of 938 was in any way similar to the later mormaerdom or earldom.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 175 &amp; 211&amp;ndash;212.; The second death, entered with that of Æthelstan, is that of Eochaid mac Ailpín, who may, from his name, have been a kinsman of Constantín.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 175.;

Abdication and posterity
By the early 940s Constantine was an old man, perhaps more than 70 years of age. The kingdom of Alba was too new to be said to have a customary rule of succession, but Pictish and Irish precedents favoured an adult successor descended from Kenneth MacAlpin. Constantine's surviving son Indulf, probably baptised in 927, would have been too young to be a serious candidate for the kingship in the early 940s, and the obvious heir was Constantine's nephew, Malcolm I. As Malcolm was born no later than 901, by the 940s he was no longer a young man, and may have been impatient. Willingly or not&amp;mdash;the 11th century ''Prophecy of Berchán'', a verse history in the form of a supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision&amp;mdash;Constantine abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Malcolm.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 175; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 444&amp;ndash;448; Broun, &quot;Constantine II&quot;.;

Although his retirement may have been involuntary, the ''Life'' of Cathróe of Metz and the ''Prophecy of Berchán'' portray Constantine as a devout king. The monastery which Constantine retired to, and where he is said to have been abbot, was probably that of St Andrews. This had been refounded in his reign and given to the reforming Céli Dé (Culdee) movement. The Céli Dé were subsequently to be entrusted with many monasteries throughout the kingdom of Alba until replaced in the 12th century by new orders imported from France. ;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 431&amp;ndash;444; Broun, &quot;Constantine II&quot;; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 175; MacQuarrie, ''Saints of Scotland'', pp. 199&amp;ndash;210. The ''Prophecy of Berchán'' describes Constantine's &quot;fair, long reign&quot; as a time &quot;with fruit upon slender branches, with ale, with music, with good cheer; with corn, with milk, with nimble cattle; with pride, with fortune, with [worth]&quot;; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 447&amp;ndash;448.;

Seven years later the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' says:;[Malcolm I] plundered the English as far as the river Tees, and he seized a multitude of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said.;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 452&amp;ndash;453.;; Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 178&amp;ndash;181.;

Constantine's death in 952 is recorded by the Irish annals, who enter it among ecclesiastics. His son Indulf would become king on Malcolm's death. The last of Constantine's certain descendants to be king in Alba was a great-grandson, Constantine III (Constantín mac Cuiléin). Another son had died at Brunanburh, and, according to John of Worcester, Amlaíb mac Gofraid was married to a daughter of Constantine. It is possible that Constantine had other children, but like the name of his wife, or wives, this has not been recorded.;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 171, 175, &amp; 177; Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', p. 345, table A; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 451.;

The kingdom which began to appear in Constantine's reign continued in much the same form until the Davidian Revolution in the 12th century. As with his ecclestiastical reforms, his political legacy was the creation of a new form of Scottish kingship that lasted for two centuries after his death.;Broun, &quot;Constantine II&quot;. The nature of that kingdom is, however, still a matter of debate, see Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 342&amp;ndash;350; .;
