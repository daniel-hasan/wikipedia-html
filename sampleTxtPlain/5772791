New York State Route 59 is an east-west road in southern Rockland County in the State of New York. NY 59 runs from NY 17, at Exit 15A of the New York State Thruway, in Hillburn, to US 9W in Nyack. In Suffern, New York, it shares a concurrency with U.S. Route 202 for 0.05 miles. NY 59 runs parallel to the New York State Thruway its entire route.

The presence of grade-separated interchanges at NY 304, Strawtown Road (CR 23), Western Highway (CR 15) and NY 303, along with the southern half of the formerly proposed Spring Valley Bypass, indicates that it may have been proposed at one time as a toll-free alternative to the Thruway for local, limited-access traffic. NY 59 used to go further east along Main Street in Nyack to North Broadway.;;

NY 59 begins at NY 17 in Hillburn, just south of the village of Sloatsburg.;;NY 59 passes under the New York State Thruway as it enters Suffern, but does not interchange with it. In fact, NY 59 runs under the I-87/I-287 interchange with NY 17 and I-287. At this point I-287 heads south into New Jersey, and the Thruway (I-87) heads north toward Albany. In Suffern, NY 59 overlaps U.S. Route 202 for a short distance. The roads fork, and NY 59 turns eastward towards Nyack. They will continue to run parallel to each other until NY 59's eastern terminus at U.S. Route 9W. 
In Spring Valley, NY 59 has overlaps Rockland County Route 35A for about a tenth of a mile. 
For most of its run, NY 59 is a partial freeway also called the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway. East of the interchange with the Thruway, there are consecutive interchanges with NY 304, the Palisades Parkway, NY 303, and US 9W.

In Spring Valley and Nanuet, NY 59 interchanges with the Thruway a second time, now at Exit 14.; The Thruway northbound is accessible in Spring Valley, but for those wanting to go southbound need to drive another 1000 feet past the Nanuet town line to reach the Thruway. After leaving Nanuet, NY 59 intersects with the Palisades Interstate Parkway and State Route 304. In West Nyack, the former child route of NY 59, NY59A is accessible via West Nyack Way (westbound only). NY 59 also passes the Palisades Mall in West Nyack. In Central Nyack, NY 59 intersects State Route 303. Before the Nyack townline, drivers can get on the Thruway southbound via Mountainview Ave. At the Nyack line, NY 59 becomes known as Main Street. As Main Street, NY 59 goes under the New York State Thruway one final time (not direct intersection). The Thruway continues over the Tappan Zee Bridge. Finally, NY 59 comes to its end at an intersection with U.S. Route 9W in Nyack. Main St. continues into downtown Nyack.

History
Route 59 originated as the Nyack Turnpike, the first major thoroughfare in Rockland County.;; The Nyack Turnpike Road Company was established in April of 1816 and was one of the first major public works performed by a private enterprise in history. Construction for the turnpike began in the early 1800s, with portions being used for travel by 1825. The turnpike was used as a toll road until 1893. In 1911, what is now Route 59 was designated a state highway. The road got its 59 designation in 1924 and was rendered unchanged in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering.;[http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/NewYorkCity/bluebook1929_009.html map of New York City (vicinity) 1929] accessed on September 7, 2007;;;

Traffic along Route 59 began to grow, causing problems and the introduction of a task force in 1987.; In 1990, the task force suggested that a bypass of the New York State Route 45 and 59 intersection be built. The proposed bypass was to run from the commuter lot south of Route 59 to New York State Route 306. The villages of Spring Valley and Chestnut Ridge opposed the proposal saying it would have a negative effect on them. The proposal for the bypass failed soon after. Traffic became worse when the Nanuet Mall opened in 1994. It eased in 1997, when the nearby 40-cent toll was removed from the Thruway.; That helped people moved to ride on the Thruway. The New York State Department of Transportation tried to fix the worsening situation in 1995, when they reconstructed almost 3 miles of Route 59 from the eastern border of Spring Valley to Interchange 8 of the Palisades State Parkway. The project widened the road to six lanes, helping to move traffic through the area from Grandview to Middletown Roads in Nanuet.;
