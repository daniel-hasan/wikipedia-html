Mr. Burns makes a large bet that the team will win and brings in nine ringers from the &quot;big leagues&quot; to ensure his success.It was written by John Swartzwelder, who is a big baseball fan, and directed by Jim Reardon.

Roger Clemens, Wade Boggs, Ken Griffey Jr., Steve Sax, Ozzie Smith, José Canseco, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry and Mike Scioscia all guest starred as themselves, playing the ringers hired by Mr. Burns. Terry Cashman also sang a song over the end credits.; The guest stars were recorded over several months, with differing degrees of cooperation. The episode is often named among the show's best, and was the first to beat ''The Cosby Show'' in the ratings on its original airing. Jon Lovitz also guest voices.

Plot
It is softball season in Springfield and many of the workers at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant are reluctant to sign up for the Power Plant team due to their previous unsuccessful year. Homer reveals that he has a secret weapon, a homemade bat named &quot;Wonder Bat&quot; and his co-workers eagerly join the team. Thanks in large part to Homer, the team goes through its season undefeated and earns the right to play in the championship game against the Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant.

Mr. Burns makes a million dollar bet with List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#Aristotle Amadopoulos|Aristotle Amadopoulos, owner of the Shelbyville plant, that his team will win. To secure victory in the game, Mr. Burns decides to hire major league stars and assembles a team that includes Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, Mordecai Brown, and a right fielder who has been dead for 130 years. Smithers informs Mr. Burns that the players he picked are all dead and thus Mr. Burns orders Smithers to find some current superstar players. He hires nine Major League Baseball players - Roger Clemens, Wade Boggs, Ken Griffey Jr., Steve Sax, Ozzie Smith, José Canseco, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry and Mike Scioscia - and gives them token jobs at the plant so that they can play on the team, much to the dismay of the plant workers who got the team to the championship game in the first place.

However, before the game can be played, eight of the nine players are involved in unrelated incidents: Roger Clemens acts like a chicken due to a bad hypontist; Wade Boggs is knocked unconscious by Barney over of a Palmerston vs. Pitt argument; Ken Griffey Jr. overdoses on a nerve tonic, resulting in an extreme case of Gigantism; Steve Sax is arrested for all of New York's unsolved murders; Ozzie Smith disappears in the &quot;Springfield mystery spot&quot;; José Canseco misses the game while rescuing a woman from a fire; Don Mattingly is kicked off the team due to his &quot;sideburns&quot;;and Mike Scioscia is hospitalized due to radiation poisoning contracted in the course of an overly-enthusiastic performance of his duties at the Plant. Darryl Strawberry is the only star who can play and Mr. Burns is forced to use eight of his actual employees, excepting only Homer who remains on the bench because Strawberry plays his position. During the game Strawberry hits nine home runs, but Shelbyville is able to counter the star right fielder's offensive prowess. With the score tied and bases loaded with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, Burns elects to field a right-handed hitter against a left-handed pitcher and pinch hits Homer for Strawberry, to the chagrin of most of the spectators. The very first pitch hits Homer in the head, rendering him unconscious, but forcing in the winning run. Homer, still unconscious, is paraded as a hero.;;;

Production
Left to right: Steve Sax, Homer, Darryl Strawberry, Ken Griffey Jr, Lenny, Don Mattingly, Mike Scioscia (sitting), Smithers, Roger Clemens and Ozzie Smith.
&quot;Homer at the Bat&quot; took a long time to produce.; It was written by John Swartzwelder, who is a big baseball fan,; but was suggested by Sam Simon, who wanted an episode filled with real Major League Baseball players.;; Executive producers Al Jean and Mike Reiss doubted that they would be able to get nine players, thinking that they would be able to get three at best. However, they succeeded, and the nine players who agreed to guest star were recorded over a period of six months,;; whenever they were playing the Los Angeles Dodgers or Anaheim Angels.; In several cases, the writers were unable to get the player who was their first choice.; One of the players who turned down the chance to guest star was Ryne Sandberg.;; 

All of the players were cooperative except for José Canseco, who was intimidating.; He disliked his original part and insisted it be rewritten, and the writers grudgingly; made him as heroic as possible.; He was originally slated to wake up in bed with Edna Krabappel and miss the game, but Canseco's then-wife, Esther Haddad, objected.;; He disliked his caricature, stating that &quot;the animation looked nothing like [him],&quot;; but that he found the acting was very easy.;; When asked about his part by the San Jose Mercury, he responded, &quot;that was 100 years ago,&quot; hung up the phone, and did not answer any of the paper's subsequent calls for an interview about his guest spot.;

Ken Griffey Jr. did not understand the line &quot;there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited&quot; and got quite frustrated when he was recording it. He was directed by Mike Reiss, and his father Ken Griffey, Sr. was also present, trying to coach his son.; Roger Clemens, who made his own chicken noises, was directed by Jeff Martin, as was Wade Boggs.; Mike Reiss directed most of the other players.; Mike Scioscia accepted his guest spot in &quot;half a second,&quot; while Ozzie Smith has stated that he would like to guest star again &quot;so [he] can get out [of the Springfield Mystery spot].&quot;; Don Mattingly, who was forced to shave off his &quot;sideburns&quot; by Mr. Burns during the episode, would later have an actual &quot;haircut controversy&quot;, while he was playing for the New York Yankees. The coaching staff forced him to cut his long hair, and was briefly dropped from the team line-up for not doing so. Many people believed the joke in the episode to be a reference to the incident, but &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot; was recorded a year before it happened.; Many of the guest stars, including Terry Cashman, Wade Boggs and Darryl Strawberry all admit that they are more well known because of their appearance in the episode, Cashman having &quot;Talkin' Softball&quot; requested more often than &quot;Talkin' Baseball&quot;.;

One of the hardest pieces of editing was the hypnotist segment, which featured several of the guest stars speaking in unison. It was difficult because the parts were recorded over a period of several months and thus it was hard to sync their voices.; Rich Moore was originally intended to direct the episode, but as he did not know anything about baseball he was switched with Jim Reardon, who was a baseball fan. Moore was given the episode &quot;Lisa the Greek&quot; instead.;; Many of the player designs were difficult, because the animators had a hard time designing real world people during the early years.;

Cultural references
The episode makes several allusions to the film ''The Natural''. Homer's secret weapon, his self-created &quot;Wonderbat&quot;, is akin to Roy Hobbs's &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, and both bats are eventually destroyed. The scene featuring the explosion of stadium lights as Homer circles the basepaths is also taken directly from the film.;; The end song &quot;Talkin' Softball&quot; is a parody of &quot;Talkin' Baseball&quot; by Terry Cashman. The new version of the song was written by Jeff Martin, but Cashman was brought in to sing it.; The scenes of the Power Plant team traveling from city to city by train, overlaid with the pennant of the city they are going to, is a reference to the 1942 film ''The Pride of the Yankees''.;; Carl batting with a piano leg is a reference to Norm Cash of the Detroit Tigers, who once tried to bat with a table leg in a game where Nolan Ryan was extremely overpowering.;

Reception
Ken Griffey, Jr.
During the previous season, Fox had put ''The Simpsons'' in a timeslot that meant it was in direct competition with ''The Cosby Show'', which won the timeslot every time. &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot; managed to gain higher ratings than ''The Cosby Show'', the first time an episode had, in its original airing, done so.; Regular cast members, Harry Shearer and Julie Kavner disliked the episode because of its focus on the guest stars and its surreal tone.; They were particularly annoyed by the Mattingly sideburns joke.;
Roger Clemens was one of the nine players to guest star in the episode.
Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', praised the episode, calling it &quot;a great episode because the accidents that befall the pro players are so funny.&quot;; Chris Turner, the author of the book ''Planet Simpson'', said that the episode was the indication that &quot;the Golden Age [of the show] had arrived.&quot;;; Nate Meyers gave the episode four and a half out of five, stating &quot;the script makes great use of the baseball superstars, giving each of them a strong personality and plenty of pep (the highlight has to be Mattingly's clash with Mr. Burns).&quot;;; Colin Jacobson disliked the episode: &quot;when [&quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;] originally aired, I didn't like it. While I've warmed up to the show slightly over the last decade, I still think it's generally weak, and I'd definitely pick it as Season Three's worst.&quot;;;

''Entertainment Weekly'' placed the episode fifteenth on their top 25 ''The Simpsons'' episodes list, noting it was &quot;early proof that ''The Simpsons'' could juggle a squad of guest stars without giving the family short shrift.&quot;;; It was placed third on AskMen.com's &quot;Top 10: Simpsons Episodes&quot; list, Rich Weir called it &quot;one of the show's more memorable moments&quot; and &quot;effective as it combines a slew of guest stars with some hilarious material for Homer.&quot;;; The entire episode was placed first on ESPN.com's list of the &quot;Top 100 Simpsons sport moments&quot;, released in 2004. Greg Collins, the author of the list, gave great praise of the episode. He stated that this is the &quot;king of all sports episodes, and perhaps the greatest ''Simpsons'' episode ever.&quot; A friend of Collins later met guest star Mike Scioscia and told him the he thought his guest spot was the best thing Scioscia had ever done, he responded &quot;Thanks, I think&quot;.;;

IGN.com ranked the baseballer's performances as the seventeenth best guest appearance in the show's history, calling &quot;each of these appearances was hilarious, making this a classic episode.&quot;;; The Phoenix.com praised the performances of each of the guest stars, but Darryl Strawberry, who they put in the fifth position, was the only one to make their &quot;Top 20 guest stars&quot; list.;;
