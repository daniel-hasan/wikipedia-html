Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airportis located in Hebron, unincorporated Boone County, Kentucky, United States and serves the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky metropolitan area|Greater Cincinnati metropolitan area.The first airplane landed at the airport January 10, 1947.;The Cincinnati Enquirer, December 31, 1999; p3; Despite being located in Boone County, the airport operations are governed by the neighboring Kenton County Airport Board. The airport's code, CVG, comes from the nearest major city at the time of its opening, Covington, Kentucky, although the airport authority likes to say it stands for &quot;Cincinnati Very Good.&quot; [http://www.cvgairport.com/airport/fun/facts.shtml]

The airport's terminal/remote-concourse configuration, combined with simultaneous triple landing/takeoff capabilities, makes CVG a particularly efficient airport for flight operations. CVG is the third largest hub of Delta Air Lines and is the central hub of Delta's wholly-owned subsidiary airline, Comair, which provides regional jet service under the Delta Connection banner.As such, the airport serves an important role in Delta's midwest Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke system. After Delta's bankruptcy was announced in 2005, flight cutbacks were announced that directly affected CVG. The numbers and sizes of flights to many cities have been reduced in the late-hour flights to better match local demand, though several services were ended altogether. After the reduction, CVG offers 400 flights per day to 120 nonstop destinations.

The airport has 3 terminals. Terminal 1 closed down on January 16, 2007. It is currently being used by the airport for Administrative offices. Until recently it was served only by US Airways Express. American Airlines, United Airlines and US Airways all operate in Terminal 2.Terminal 3, built specifically for and by Delta, has 3 remote concourses connected by an underground tram and bus system.Terminal 3 is served by Delta, its regional affiliates, and Skyteam partners Continental, and Northwest.Terminal 3 is the only one with US customs offices, and is therefore used by USA3000, and until recently, Transmeridian Airlines.

Industrial murals
The airport is home to 14 large Art Deco murals that were originally created for the Cincinnati Union Terminal during the Great Depression.Mosaic murals depicting people at work in local Cincinnati workplaces were incorporated into the interior design of the railroad station by Winold Reiss, a German-born artist with a reputation in interior design.

When one Concourse of the Station was designated for demolition in 1972, a &quot;Save the Terminal Committee&quot; raised funds to remove and transport the 14 murals in the concourse to new locations in the Airport. They were placed in Terminal 1, and in Terminals 2 and 3, which were then being constructed as part of a major airport expansion and renovation.

The murals were also featured in a scene in the film ''Rain Man'' starring Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. In addition, a walkway to one of the terminals at CVG was featured in the scene in the film when Hoffman's character Raymond refused to fly on a plane.
