History


Sam Houston
In August 1836, John Kirby Allen and Augustus Chapman Allen, two real estate entrepreneurs from New York City, purchased 6,642&amp;nbsp;acres (27&amp;nbsp;km²) of land along Buffalo Bayou with the intent of founding a city.;; The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general of the Texans at the Battle of San Jacinto,; who was elected President in September 1836. 

Houston was granted incorporation on June 5, 1837, with James S. Holman becoming its first mayor.;[http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/HH/hdh3.html Houston, Texas]. ''Handbook of Texas Online''. Retrieved on 2007-01-10.; In the same year, Houston became the county seat of Harrisburg County (now Harris County) and the temporary capital of the Republic of Texas.;; In 1840, the community established a chamber of commerce in part to promote shipping and waterborne business at the newly created port on Buffalo Bayou.;[http://www.houstontx.gov/hr/savvypages/sum06/sum06_heritage.htm Born on the Bayou: city's murky start].

Houston, circa 1873
By 1860, Houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton.; Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston, where they met rail lines to the ports of Galveston and Beaumont. During the American Civil War, Houston served as a headquarters for General John B. Magruder|John Bankhead Magruder, who used the city as an organization point for the Battle of Galveston.;; After the Civil War, Houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of Galveston. 

In 1900, after Galveston was struck by a devastating hurricane, efforts to make Houston into a viable deepwater port were accelerated.;[http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/governors/rising/sayers-galv.html J.H.W. Stele to Sayers, September 11-12, 1900]. ''Texas State Library &amp; Archives Commission'', Retrieved on August 31, 2007; The following year, oil discovered at the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont prompted the development of the Texas petroleum industry.;; In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt approved a $1 million improvement project for the Houston Ship Channel. President Woodrow Wilson opened the Port of Houston in 1914, seven years after digging began. By 1930, Houston had become Texas's most populous city.;; 
Houston Ship Channel
When World War II started, tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products during the war.;; Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators.;; The M. D. Anderson Foundation formed the Texas Medical Center in 1945. After the war, Houston's economy reverted to being primarily port-driven. In 1948, several unincorporated areas were annexed into the city limits, which more than doubled the city's size, and Houston proper began to spread across the region.;;;

In 1950, the availability of air conditioning provided impetus for many companies to relocate to Houston resulting in an economic boom and producing a key shift in the city's economy toward the energy sector.;[http://www.oldhouseweb.com/stories/Detailed/725.shtml How Air Conditioning Changed America].

The space shuttle, atop its Boeing 747 SCA, flying over Johnson Space Center
The increased production of the local shipbuilding industry during World War II spurred Houston's growth,;; as did the establishment in 1961 of NASA's &quot;Manned Spacecraft Center&quot; (renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1973), which created the city's aerospace industry. The Astrodome, nicknamed the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World,&quot;;; opened in 1965 as the world's first indoor domed sports stadium.

During the late 1970s, Houston experienced a population boom as people from Rust Belt states moved to Texas in large numbers.;; The new residents came for the numerous employment opportunities in the petroleum industry, created as a result of the Arab Oil Embargo. 

The population boom ended abruptly in the mid-1980s, as oil prices fell precipitously. The space industry also suffered in 1986 after the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after launch. The late 1980s saw a recession affect the city's economy. 

Since the 1990s, as a result of the recession, Houston has made efforts to diversify its economy by focusing on aerospace and biotechnology and by reducing its dependence on the petroleum industry. In 1997, Houstonians elected Lee P. Brown as the city's first African American mayor.;;

Hurricane Rita evacuation
In June 2001, Tropical Storm Allison dumped up toof rain on parts of Houston, causing the worst flooding in the city's history; the storm cost billions of dollars in damage and killed 20 people in Texas.;; Many neighborhoods and communities have changed since the storm. By December of that same year, Houston-based energy company Enron collapsed into the second-largest ever U.S. bankruptcy during an investigation surrounding fabricated partnerships that were allegedly used to hide debt and inflate profits. 

In August 2005, Houston became a shelter to more than 150,000 people from New Orleans who evacuated from Hurricane Katrina.;; One month later, approximately 2.5 million Houston area residents evacuated when Hurricane Rita approached the Gulf Coast, leaving little damage to the Houston area. This event marked the largest urban evacuation in the history of the United States.;;;[http://www.house.gov/brady/2007_appropriations.shtml 8th Congressional District of Texas 2007 Appropriations Project Requests].

Geography

A simulated-color image of Houston
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 601.7 square miles (1,558.4&amp;nbsp;km²); this comprises 579.4 square miles (1,500.7&amp;nbsp;km²) of land and 22.3 square miles (57.7&amp;nbsp;km²) of water.

Most of Houston is located on the gulf coastal plain, and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and forest. Much of the city was built on forested land, marshes, swamp, or prairie, which are all still visible in surrounding areas. Flatness of the local terrain, when combined with urban sprawl, has made flooding a recurring problem for the city.;[http://www.crwr.utexas.edu/gis/gishyd98/class/trmproj/ahrens/prepro.htmFlood Forecasting for the Buffalo Bayou Using CRWR-PrePro and HEC-HMS].

The ship channel continues past Galveston and then into the Gulf of Mexico. 

=Geology=
Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly-cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic matter that, over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.;[http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/HH/hch7.html Harris County].

Houston was incorporated in 1837 under the ward system of representation. The ward designation is the progenitor of the nine current-day Houston City Council districts. Locations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the Interstate&amp;nbsp;610 Loop. The inside encompasses the central business district and many residential neighborhoods that predate World War II. More recently, high-density residential areas have been developed within the loop. The city's outlying areas, suburbs and enclaves are located outside of the loop. Beltway 8 encircles the city another 5&amp;nbsp;miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) farther out.

Voters rejected efforts to have separate residential and commercial land-use districts in 1948, 1962, and 1993. Rather than a single central business district as the center of the city's employment, multiple districts have grown throughout the city in addition to downtown which include Uptown, Texas&amp;nbsp;Medical&amp;nbsp;Center, Midtown, the Energy&amp;nbsp;Corridor, Greenway&amp;nbsp;Plaza, Westchase, and Greenspoint.
