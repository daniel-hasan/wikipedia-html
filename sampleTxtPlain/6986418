The McDonald Bridge (usually referred to as the CP Railway Bridge) is a railway bridge that spans the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan Canada. It was built as part of the Canadian Pacific Railway rail line that connects Saskatoon to the Sutherland rail yards. It is the northernmost of the city's two rail bridges. Although officially called the McDonald Bridge, locals rarely use this name; it is usually referred to as either the CPR Bridge, the 33rd Street Railway Bridge, or simply, the Railway Bridge (the city's second rail bridge, to avoid confusion, is generally known as the Grand Trunk Bridge).

The bridge is unusual for a rail bridge in that it includes a pedestrian walkway, allowing users to cross between the west side of the bridge, which is adjacent to a park, and the east side, near the University of Saskatchewan campus, Innovation Place Research Park research park, and Preston Crossing retail centre.
