Coonoor (Tamil : குன்னூர் )is a city and a municipality in the Nilgiris districtin the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is a small quiet hill town in the Nilgiri hills in southern India. It has a reputation (shared by many Indian hill stations) for being a reality-defying idyllic Shangri-La of sorts. However, the growing networked economy, and the rampant influx of tourists to the region in the past few decades have eroded this image of Coonoor to some degree.

Background
Coonoor town panoramaThe town is the second largest in the Nilgiri hills after Ooty, the district head quarters. 
Coonoor’s dominant demographic is a healthy mix of religions, languages and cultures - caused by the tourists who decide to retire here, the Indian Army’s regimental headquarters and Staff College (DSSC) in neighboring Wellington Cantonment, and the local boarding schools. Economic development of the town has at best been lopsided, with very little going towards the maintenance of the town.

Local Economy
Coonoor's economy relies on seasonal tourist traffic during the summer months, and on the tea industry year round.

The local populace almost entirely depends on the tea trade. The massive private tea plantations that surround the hills produce fresh green tea leaves which are picked, processed and packaged in bulk in local factories, for sale at auction houses in Coonoor, Coimbatore and Cochin.


=Tourism=
The hills are among the more scenic spots in Tamil Nadu, and consequently attract enormous amounts of tourists during the hot Indian summer months. The town’s infrastructure often finds itself unable to handle the tourist inflow, and life turns especially chaotic when the local horticultural society holds its annual “Fruit Show” at the peak of the tourist season, hosted at Sim's Park. 

There are several scenic areas around Coonoor. Coonoor provides tourists with a panoramic view of Eastern and Western Ghats along with its ravines, valleys, and waterfalls. There are some classical viewpoints close to Coonoor notably Dolphin's Nose, Lamb's Rock and Lady Canning's Seat.

=Other Industry=

Coonoor is home to the Pasteur Institute of India [http://mohfw.nic.in/kk/95/ib/95ib0l01.htm] which produces rabies vaccines. 

Coonoor has some Sericulture. The Government operates a Silk Farm, though this is largely a research facility. Floriculture and strawberry cultivation are taking root of late. 

= Education=
Schools are a significant contributor to the local economy. The expensive boarding (residential) schools have for nearly a century now been a feature of the Nilgiris and Coonoor. Originally modelled as British vocational training centers, these have now become comprehensive Kindergarten - Higher Secondary (K-12) schools based on the Indian (Central or State) schooling systems. The pleasant climate and utopian ideas of children growing up away from the maddening rush of life attract parents from all over the world. The schools are generally very well equipped by Indian and International standards, and mostly cater to the Indian elite. However, since most schools are also open to locals, they don't always breed elitist values. Many of these schools are owned and operated by Catholic missionaries. The reasonable availability of infrastructure allows these schools to excel in sports, unlike most other schools in India which have a very strong academic focus. These schools include:
