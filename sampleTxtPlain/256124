''Tengu'' and a Buddhist monk, by Kawanabe Kyōsai. The ''tengu'' wears the cap and pom-pommed sash of a follower of Shugendō.

 are a class of supernatural creatures found in Japanese folklore, art, theater, and literature. They are one of the best known ''yōkai'' (monster-spirits) and are sometimes worshipped as Shinto ''kami'' (revered spirits or gods). Although they take their name from a dog-like Chinese demon, the ''tengu'' were originally thought to take the forms of birds of prey, and they are traditionally depicted with both human and avian characteristics. The earliest ''tengu'' were pictured with beaks, but this feature has often been humanized as an unnaturally long nose, which today is practically the ''tengu's'' defining characteristic in the popular imagination.

Buddhism long held that the ''tengu'' were disruptive demons and harbingers of war. Their image gradually softened, however, into one of protective, if still dangerous, spirits of the mountains and forests. ''Tengu'' are associated with the ascetic practice known as Shugendō, and they are usually depicted in the distinctive garb of its followers, the ''yamabushi''.

The ''tengu'' in art appears in a large number of shapes, but it usually falls somewhere between a large, monstrous bird and a wholly anthropomorphized being, often with a red face or an unusually large or long nose. Early depictions of ''tengu'' show them as kite-like beings who can take a human-like form, often retaining avian wings, head or beak. The ''tengu's'' long nose seems to have been conceived sometime in the 14th century, likely as a humanization of the original bird's bill.;de Visser, pp. 61. The kite referred to here is ''tobi'' or ''tonbi'' (鳶), the Japanese black-eared kite (''Milvus migrans lineatus'').; The ''tengu's'' long noses ally them with the Shinto deity Sarutahiko, who is described in the Japanese historical text, the ''Nihon Shoki'', with a similar proboscis measuring seven hand-spans in length.;[http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=137 Encyclopedia of Shinto:Sarutahiko];In village festivals the two figures are often portrayed with identical red, phallic-nosed mask designs.;Moriarty p. 109. See also: [http://blog.hix05.com/blog/2006/11/post_35.html Japanese language blog post on ''tengu'' and Sarutahiko].;

Some of the earliest representations of ''tengu'' appear in Japanese picture scrolls, such as the , painted ca. 1296, which parodies high-ranking priests by endowing them the hawk-like beaks of ''tengu'' demons.; Fister p. 105. See images from this scroll [http://www.nezu-muse.or.jp/syuuzou/kaiga/10363.1.html here] and [http://www.nezu-muse.or.jp/syuuzou/kaiga/10363.2.html here].; ''Tengu'' are often pictured as taking the shape of some sort of priest. Beginning in the 13th century, ''tengu'' came to be associated in particular with the ''yamabushi'', the mountain ascetics who practice Shugendō.;de Visser, pp. 55-57.; The association soon found its way into Japanese art, where ''tengu'' are most frequently depicted in the ''yamabushi's'' distinctive costume, which includes aand a .;Fister, p. 103.

''Tengu'' are commonly depicted holding magical , fans made of feathers. In folk tales, these fans sometimes have the ability to grow or shrink a person's nose, but usually they are attributed the power to stir up great winds. Various other strange accessories may be associated with ''tengu'', such as a type of tall, one-toothed ''geta'' sandal often called ''tengu-geta''.;Mizuki 2001, p. 122.;

Origins
''Tengu'' as a kite-like monster, from Toriyama Sekien's Gazu Hyakki Yakō

The term ''tengu'' and the characters used to write it are borrowed from the name of a fierce demon from Chinese folklore called ''tiāngoǔ''. Chinese literature assigns this creature a variety of descriptions, but most often it is a fierce and wikt:anthropophagy|anthropophagous canine monster that resembles a shooting star or comet. It makes a noise like thunder and brings war wherever it falls. One account from the ''Shù Yì Jì'' (述異記, &quot;A Collection of Bizarre Stories&quot;), written in 1791, describes a dog-like ''tiāngoǔ'' with a sharp beak and an upright posture, but usually ''tiāngoǔ'' bear little resemblance to their Japanese counterparts.;de Visser, pp. 27-30.;

The 23rd chapter of the ''Nihon Shoki'', written in 720, is generally held to contain the first recorded mention of ''tengu'' in Japan. In this account a large shooting star appears and is identified by a Buddhist priest as a &quot;heavenly dog&quot;, and much like the ''tiāngoǔ'' of China, the star precedes a military uprising. Although the Chinese characters for ''tengu'' are used in the text, accompanying phonetic furigana characters give the reading as ''amatsukitsune'' (''heavenly fox''). M.W. de Visser speculated that the early Japanese ''tengu'' may represent a conglomeration of two Chinese spirits: the ''tiāngoǔ'' and the fox spirits called ''huli jing''.;de Visser, pp. 34-35.;

How the ''tengu'' was transformed from a dog-meteor into a bird-man is not clear. Some Japanese scholars have supported the theory that the ''tengu's'' image derives from that of the Hindu eagle deity Garuda, who was pluralized in Buddhist scripture as one of the major races of non-human beings. Like the ''tengu'', the ''garuda'' are often portrayed in a human-like form with wings and a bird's beak. The name ''tengu'' seems to be written in place of that of the ''garuda'' in a Japanese sutra called the ''Enmyō Jizō Kyō'' (延命地蔵経), but this was likely written in the Edo period, long after the ''tengu's'' image was established. At least one early story in the ''Konjaku Monogatari'' describes a ''tengu'' carrying off a dragon, which is reminiscent of the ''garuda's'' feud with the ''nāga'' serpents. In other respects, however, the ''tengu's'' original behavior differs markedly from that of the ''garuda'', which is generally friendly towards Buddhism. De Visser has speculated that the ''tengu'' may be descended from an ancient Shinto bird-demon which was syncretized with both the ''garuda'' and the ''tiāngoǔ'' when Buddhism arrived in Japan. However, he found little evidence to support this idea.;de Visser, pp. 87-90.;

A later version of the ''Kujiki'', an ancient Japanese historical text, writes the name of Amanozako, a monstrous female deity born from the god Susanoo's spat-out ferocity, with characters meaning ''tengu deity'' (天狗神). The book describes Amanozako as a raging creature capable of flight, with the body of a human, the head of a beast, a long nose, long ears, and long teeth that can chew through swords. An 18th century book called thesuggests that this goddess may be the true predecessor of the ''tengu'', but the date and authenticity of the ''Kujiki'', and of that edition in particular, remain disputed.;de Visser, pp. 43-44; Mizuki, Mujara 4, p.7.;

Evil spirits and angry ghosts
Iga no Tsubone confronts the tormented spirit of Sasaki no Kiyotaka, by Yoshitoshi. Sasaki's ghost appears with the wings and claws of a ''tengu''.

The ''Konjaku Monogatari'', a collection of stories published sometime during the late Heian Period, contains some of the earliest tales of ''tengu'', already characterized as they would be for centuries to come. These ''tengu'' are the troublesome opponents of Buddhism, who mislead the pious with false images of Buddha, carry off monks and drop them in remote places, possess women in an attempt to seduce holy men, rob temples, and endow those who worship them with unholy power. They often disguise themselves as priests or nuns, but their true form seems to be that of a kite.;de Visser, pp. 38-43.;

Throughout the 12th and 13th centuries, accounts continued of ''tengu'' attempting to cause trouble in the world. They were now established as the ghosts of angry, vain, or heretical priests who had fallen on the &quot;''tengu''-road&quot; (天狗道, ''tengudō''). They began to possess people, especially women and girls, and speak through their mouths( ''Kitsune#Kitsunetsuki|kitsunetsuki''). Still the enemies of Buddhism, the demons also turned their attention to the royal family. The Kojidan tells of an Empress who was possessed, and the Ōkagami reports that Emperor Sanjō was made blind by a ''tengu'', the ghost of a priest who resented the throne. ;de Visser, pp. 45-47. This ''tengu''-ghost eventually appeared and admitted to riding on the emperor's back with his wings clasped over the man's eyes.; 

One notorious ''tengu'' from the 12th century was himself the ghost of an emperor. The ''Tale of Hōgen|Hōgen Monogatari'' tells the story of Emperor Sutoku, who was forced by his father to abandon the throne. When he later raised the Hōgen Rebellion to take back the country from Emperor Go-Shirakawa, he was defeated and exiled to Sanuki Province on Shikoku. According to legend he died in torment, having sworn to haunt the nation of Japan as a great demon, and thus became a fearsome ''tengu'' with long nails and eyes like a kite's. ;de Visser, pp. 48-49.;

In stories from the 13th century, ''tengu'' began to abduct young boys as well as the priests they had always targeted. The boys were often returned, while the priests would be found tied to the tops of trees or other high places. All of the ''tengu's'' victims, however, would come back in a state of near death or madness, sometimes after having been tricked into eating animal dung. ;de Visser, pp. 55-57.;

The ''tengu'' of this period were often conceived of as the ghosts of the arrogant, and as a result the creatures have became strongly associated with vanity and pride. Today the Japanese expression ''tengu ni naru'', literally, &quot;he is turning into a ''tengu''&quot;, is still used to describe a conceited person.;Mizuki 2001.;

Great and small demons;

In the ''Genpei Jōsuiki'', written in the late Kamakura period, a god appears to Go-Shirakawa and gives a detailed account of ''tengu'' ghosts. He says that they fall onto the ''tengu'' road because, as Buddhists, they cannot go to Hell, yet as people with bad principles, they also cannot go to Heaven. He describes the appearance of different types of ''tengu'': the ghosts of priests, nuns, ordinary men, and ordinary women, all of whom in life possessed excessive pride. The god introduces the notion that not all ''tengu'' are equal; knowledgeable men become , but ignorant ones become .;de Visser, pp. 51-53.; 

The philosopher Hayashi Razan lists the greatest of these ''daitengu'' as Sōjōbō of Kurama, Tarōbō of Atago, and Jirōbō of Hira.;de Visser, pp. 71.; The demons of Kurama and Atago are among the most famous ''tengu''.;Mizuki 2001.;

A section of the ''Tengu Meigikō'', later quoted by Inoue Enryō, lists the ''daitengu'' in this order:
* of Mount Kurama
* of Mount Atago
* of the Hira Mountains
* of Mount Akiba
* of Mount Kōmyō
* of Mount Hiko
* of Mount Daisen
* of Mount Ueno (Ueno Park)
* of Itsukushima
* of Mount Ōmine
* of Katsuragi
* of Hitachi Province
* of Mount Fuji
* of Mount Takao
* of Shiramine
* of Mount Iizuna
* of Higo Province;de Visser, p. 82; most kanji and some name corrections retrieved from [http://www1.bbweb-arena.com/baron/tengu.html here].;

''Daitengu'' are often pictured in a more human-like form than their underlings, and due to their long noses, they may also called . ''Kotengu'' may conversely be depicted as more bird-like. They are sometimes called , or.;Mizuki 2001; Inoue Enryō described two kinds of ''tengu'' in his ''Tenguron'': the great ''daitengu'', and the small, bird-like ''konoha-tengu'' who live in ''Cryptomeria'' trees. The ''konoha-tengu'' are noted in a book from 1746 called the , as bird-like creatures with wings two meters across which were seen catching fish in the Ōi River, but this name rarely appears in literature otherwise.;de Visser, p. 84; Mizuki 2003, p. 70. The term ''konoha-tengu'' is often mentioned in English texts as a synonym for ''daitengu'', but this appears to be a widely-repeated mistake which is not corroborated by Japanese-language sources.;

Creatures that do not fit the classic bird or ''yamabushi'' image are sometimes called ''tengu''. For example, ''tengu'' in the guise of wood-spirits may be called , but this word can also refer to ''tengu'' with canine mouths or other features.;Mizuki 2001; The people of Kōchi Prefecture on Shikoku believe in a creature called , but this is a small child-like being who loves ''sumō'' wrestling and sometimes dwells in the water, and is generally considered one of the many kinds of ''kappa''.;Mizuki, Mujara 4, p. 94; Another water-dwelling ''tengu'' is theof the Greater Tokyo Area. This creature is rarely seen, but it is believed to create strange fireballs and be a nuisance to fishermen. ;Mizuki, Mujara 1, p. 38; [http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/cgi-bin/YoukaiDB/kwaiiList.cgi?Name=%1b%24B%25%2b%25o%25F%25s%250%1b%28B&amp;Pref=&amp;Area=%c1%b4%b9%f1 Kaii*Yōkai Denshō Database: Kawatengu];

Protective spirits and deities
A ''tengu'' ''mikoshi'' (portable shrine) in the city of Beppu, Ōita|Beppu, Ōita Prefecture, on Kyūshū.

The ''Shasekishū'', a book of Buddhist parables from the Kamakura period, makes a point of distinguishing between good and bad ''tengu''. The book explains that the former are in command of the latter and are the protectors, not opponents, of Buddhism - although the flaw of pride or ambition has caused them to fall onto the demon road, they remain the same basically good, ''dharma''-abiding persons they were in life.;de Visser, pp. 58-60.;

The ''tengu's'' unpleasant image continued to erode in the 17th century. Some stories now presented them as much less malicious, protecting and blessing Buddhist institutions rather than menacing them or setting them on fire. According to a legend in the 18th-century , a ''tengu'' took the form of a ''yamabushi'' and faithfully served the abbot of a Zen monastery until the man guessed his attendant's true form. The ''tengu's'' wings and huge nose then reappeared. The ''tengu'' requested a piece of wisdom from his master and left, but he continued, unseen, to provide the monastery with miraculous aid.;de Visser, pp. 72-76.;

A 
In the 18th and 19th centuries, ''tengu'' came to be feared as the vigilant protectors of certain forests. In the 1764 collection of strange stories , a tale tells of a man who wanders into a deep valley while gathering leaves, only to be faced with a sudden and ferocious hailstorm. A group of peasants later tell him that he was in the valley where the ''guhin'' live, and anyone who takes a single leaf from that place will surely die. In the , written in 1849, the author describes the customs of the wood-cutters of Mino Province, who used a sort of rice cake called ''kuhin-mochi'' to placate the ''tengu'', who would otherwise perpetrate all sorts of mischief. In other provinces a special kind of fish called ''okoze'' was offered to the ''tengu'' by woodsmen and hunters, in exchange for a successful day's work.;de Visser, pp. 76-79. The ''okoze'' fish is known to science as ''Anema inerme'', the mottled stargazer.; The people of Ishikawa Prefecture have until recently believed that the ''tengu'' loathe mackerel, and have used this fish as a charm against kidnappings and hauntings by the mischievous spirits. ;Folklore texts cited in the Kaii*Yōkai Denshō Database:

''Tengu'' are worshipped as beneficial ''kami'' (''gods'' or ''revered spirits'') in various Japanese religious cults. For example, the ''tengu'' Saburō of Izuna is worshipped on that mountain and various others as , one of the primary deities in the ''Izuna Shugen'' cult, which also has ties to fox sorcery and the Dakini of Tantric Buddhism. Izuna Gongen is depicted as a beaked, winged figure with snakes wrapped around his limbs, surrounded by a halo of flame, riding on the back of a fox and brandishing a sword. Worshippers of ''tengu'' on other sacred mountains have adopted similar images for their deities, such asorof Akiba andof Saijō-ji Temple in Odawara.;de Visser (Fox and Badger) p. 107–109.

In popular folk tales
The folk hero Kintarō upsets a nest of small ''tengu''.

''Tengu'' appear frequently in the orally-transmitted tales collected by Japanese folklorists. As these stories are often humorous, they tend to portray ''tengu'' as ridiculous creatures who are easily tricked or confused by humans. Some common folk tales in which ''tengu'' appear include:

* : A boy looks through an ordinary piece of bamboo and pretends he can see distant places. A ''tengu'', overwhelmed by curiosity, offers to trade it for a magic straw cloak that renders the wearer invisible. Having duped the ''tengu'', the boy continues his mischief while wearing the cloak.;Seki p. 170. Online version [http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/folk/tengu/tengu.html here]. ;

* : An old man has a lump or tumor on his face. In the mountains he encounters a band of ''tengu'' making merry and joins their dancing. He pleases them so much that they take the lump off his face, thinking that he will want it back and join them the next night. An unpleasant neighbor, who also has a lump, hears of the old man's good fortune and attempts to repeat it. The ''tengu'', however, simply give him the first lump in addition to his own, either to keep their bargain, or because they are disgusted by his bad dancing.;Seki p. 128-129. Online version [http://homepage2.nifty.com/p-sona/english/kagawa-E.html here]. ''Oni'' often take the place of the ''tengu'' in this story.;

*A scoundrel obtains a ''tengu's'' magic fan, which can shrink or grow noses. He secretly uses this item to grotesquely extend the nose of a rich man's daughter, and then shrinks it again in exchange for her hand in marriage. Later he accidentally fans himself while he dozes, and his nose grows so long it reaches heaven, resulting in painful misfortune for him.;Seki p. 171. A version of this story has been popularized in English as &quot;The Badger and the Magic Fan&quot;.([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Booksources&amp;isbn=0399219455 ISBN 0-3992-1945-5]);

* : A gambler meets a ''tengu'', who asks him what he is most frightened of. The gambler lies, claiming that he is terrified of gold or ''mochi''. The ''tengu'' answers truthfully that he is frightened of a kind of plant or some other mundane item. The ''tengu'', thinking he is playing a cruel trick, then causes money or rice cakes to rain down on the gambler. The gambler is of course delighted and proceeds to scare the ''tengu'' away with the thing he fears most. The gambler then obtains the ''tengu's'' magic gourd (or another treasured item) that was left behind.;Seki p. 172. Online version [http://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Gaien/7211/kudos8/tengu.html here].;

* A ''tengu'' bothers a woodcutter, showing off his supernatural abilities by guessing everything the man is thinking. The woodcutter swings his axe, and a splinter of wood hits the ''tengu'' on the nose. The ''tengu'' flees in terror, exclaiming that humans are dangerous creatures who can do things without thinking about them.;Seki p. 54. This story often involves other mountain spirits, such as the ''yama-uba''. A version specifically involving a ''tengu'' is recorded in Japanese [http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/YoukaiCard/0950002.shtml here].;

Martial arts
Ushiwaka-maru training with the ''tengu'' of Mount Kurama, by Kunitsuna Utagawa. This subject is very common in ''ukiyo-e''.
Japan's dictator Hōjō Tokimune, who showed down the Mongols, fights off tengu

During the 14th century, the ''tengu'' began to trouble the world outside of the Buddhist clergy, and like their ominous ancestors the ''tiāngoǔ'', the ''tengu'' became creatures associated with war.;de Visser, pp. 67.; Legends eventually ascribed to them great knowledge in the art of skilled combat. 

This reputation seems to have its origins in a legend surrounding the famous warrior Minamoto no Yoshitsune. When Yoshitsune was a young boy going by the name of Ushiwaka-maru, his father, Yoshitomo, was assassinated by the Taira clan. Taira no Kiyomori, head of the Taira, allowed the child to survive on the grounds that he be exiled to the temple on Mount Kurama and become a monk. But one day in the Sōjō-ga-dani Valley, Ushiwaka encountered the mountain's ''tengu'', Sōjōbō. This spirit taught the boy the art of swordsmanship so that he might bring vengeance on the Taira.;de Visser, pp. 47-48.; 

Originally the actions of this ''tengu'' were portrayed as another attempt by demons to throw the world into chaos and war, but as Yoshitsune's renown as a legendary warrior increased, his monstrous teacher came to be depicted in a much more sympathetic and honorable light. In one of the most famous renditions of the story, the Noh play ''Kurama Tengu'', Ushiwaka is the only person from his temple who does not give up an outing in disgust at the sight of a strange ''yamabushi''. Sōjōbō thus befriends the boy and teaches him out of sympathy for his plight.;Outlined in Japanese [http://www.noh-kyogen.com/story/ka/kuramatengu.html here]. For another example see the picture scroll ''Tengu no Dairi'' [http://dbs.humi.keio.ac.jp/naraehon/ehon/index2-e.asp?ID=KL044&amp;FRAME=False here], in which the ''tengu'' of Mount Kurama is working with a Buddha (who was once Yoshitsune's father) to overthrow the Taira clan. This indicates that the ''tengu'' is now involved in a righteous cause rather than an act of wickedness.;

Two stories from the 19th century continue this theme: In the ''Sōzan Chomon Kishū'', a boy is carried off by a ''tengu'' and spends three years with the creature. He comes home with a magic gun that never misses a shot. A story from Inaba Province, related by Inoue Enryō, tells of a girl with poor manual dexterity who is suddenly possessed by a ''tengu''. The spirit wishes to rekindle the declining art of swordsmanship in the world. Soon a young samurai appears to whom the ''tengu'' has appeared in a dream, and the possessed girl instructs him as an expert swordsman.;de Visser, p. 79.; Some rumors surrounding the ''ninja'' indicate that they were also instructed by the ''tengu''.;Mizuki 2001;

Modern fiction
Profoundly entrenched in the Japanese imagination for centuries, ''tengu'' continue to be popular subjects in modern fiction, both in Japan and increasingly in other countries. They often appear among the many characters and creatures featured in Japanese cinema, animation, comics, and video games.

•In the Xbox 360 game Dead or Alive 4, an unlockable character looks like and is called Tengu.
