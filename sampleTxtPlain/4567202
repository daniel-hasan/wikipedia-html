The LVT-5 (Landing Vehicle, Tracked) was a family of amphibious armoured fighting vehicles used by the United States Marine Corps. It was first accepted into service in 1956, and saw action in the Vietnam War. 1,124 units were produced.

It was an evolution of the Landing Vehicle Tracked series, and was replaced in service by the LVT-7 family.

The most common was the LVTP-5, an armoured personnel carrier, with mine-sweeper, command, recovery and fire support variants, the latter mounting a 105 mm howitzer. An anti-aircraft version was prototyped, but never saw service.
