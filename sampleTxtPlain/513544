The Buena Vista Social Club was a members club in Havana, Cuba that held dances and musical activities, becoming a popular location for musicians to meet and play during the 1940s. In the 1990s, nearly 40 years after the club was closed, it inspired a recording made by Cuban musician Juan de Marcos González and American guitarist Ry Cooder with traditional Cuban musicians, some of whom were veterans who had performed at the club during the height of its popularity. 

The recording, named ''Buena Vista Social Club'' after the Havana institution, became an international success, and the ensemble was encouraged to perform with a full line-up in Amsterdam in 1998. German director Wim Wenders captured the performance on film, followed by a second concert in Carnegie Hall, New York City for a documentary that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders's film, also called ''Buena Vista Social Club'', was released to critical acclaim, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary feature and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the European Film Awards.

The success of both the album and film sparked a revival of international interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with international stars from different musical genres. The &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba's &quot;musical golden age&quot; between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble:Compay Segundo, Rubén González, and Ibrahim Ferrer, who died at the ages of ninety-five, eighty-four, and seventy-eight respectively; Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.

Social club
The Buena Vista Social Club was a black members-only club located in the populous Marianao neighborhood, in Cuba's capital Havana.

In 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder had been invited to Havana by British world music producer Nick Gold of World Circuit Records to record a session where two African High-life musicians from Mali were to collaborate with Cuban musicians.; On Cooder's arrival (via Mexico to avoid the ongoing U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba),;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/1997/06/28/brcuba28.xml &quot;Hurricane Cooder hits Cuba&quot;].

Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban son music with local musicians.; 

Already on board the African collaboration project were Cuban musicians including bassist Orlando &quot;Cachaito&quot; López, guitarist Eliades Ochoa and musical director Juan de Marcos González, who had himself been organizing a similar project for the Afro-Cuban All Stars. A search for additional musicians led the team to singer Manuel &quot;Puntillita&quot; Licea, pianist Rubén González and octogenarian singer Compay Segundo, who all agreed to record for the project.;

Within three days of the project's birth, Cooder, Gold and de Marcos had organized a large group of performers and arranged for recording sessions to commence at Havana's EGREM Studios, formerly owned by RCA records, where the equipment and atmosphere had remained unchanged since the 1950s.;Steward, Sue.

Cuba's burgeoning tourist industry of the late 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest. According to The Economist magazine, &quot;In the tourist quarters of Old Havana it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous. It's as if you were to go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner.&quot;;[http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displayStory.cfm?story_ID=8401940&amp;subjectid=7933598 &quot;Now we make politics&quot;.] ''The Economist'' (December 15 2006). Retrieved 23 March 2007.; Despite the appeal of the &quot;Buena Vista&quot; ambience to tourists, Cubans themselves were less aware of the &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; than international music listeners. This was due to the foreign nature of the production, and the dominance of modern salsa, pop music and other musical forms such as reggaetón on the island.;Santiago, Chiori.

Mari Marques, a Cuban American who leads cultural tours to Cuba, contests that the preponderance of traditional musicians was not solely a consequence of the &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;. Marques believes the notion that son music had been completely neglected in Cuba is &quot;a romantic exaggeration that was propagated by U.S. media coverage&quot;, and the reality is that son trios have existed &quot;everywhere in cities such as Santiago de Cuba in the east of the island.&quot;; British world music record label Tumi music, who had worked with de Marcos and many of the ensemble musicians prior to Cooder, asserted that Cuba has over 50,000 musicians all as good as, and some as old as the &quot;Buena Vista&quot; participants, &quot;but these people hardly ever have the opportunity to share their talents with the outside world.&quot; The label lamented that, &quot;for the West to pay any real attention and consume the product, you needed someone like Ry Cooder to give it a stamp of approval first.&quot;;[http://www.tumimusic.com/english/newsletter.htm &quot;Tumi celebrate their 100th recording after two decades dedicated to bringing Latin American music, arts and culture to Europe.&quot;] Tumi music.

Writer and academic Mike Gonzalez believes the ensemble provoked a backward glance to &quot;timeless, sensual places where dreams and desire merged in a comfortable, evocative music&quot;. Gonzalez asserts that the aura evoked did not represent &quot;the real Cuba&quot; before the revolution of 1959, nor Cuba in the modern era, but that the Cuban government were happy for the tourist industry to &quot;enjoy the fruits of this confusion&quot;.;Gonzalez, Mike.

Retrieved 23 March 2007.; The American Historical Review suggested that the ''Buena Vista Social Clubs mise en scène fueled nostalgic, idealistic feelings not only of many Americans and Cubans in the United States who remember the Havana of the 1950s, but also of Cubans in Cuba. The result was a reminiscence about the pre-revolutionary era &amp;mdash; dominated by the politics of Gerardo Machado in the 1920s&amp;ndash;30s and then General Fulgencio Batista until 1959 &amp;mdash; which &quot;no longer seems so bad&quot;.;[http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&amp;url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/105.2/mr_4.html ''Buena Vista Social Club'' Film review].
