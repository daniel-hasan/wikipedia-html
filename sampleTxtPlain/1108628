''Homo floresiensis'' (&quot;Man of Flores&quot;, nicknamed Hobbit) is the name for a possible species in the genus ''Homo'', remarkable for its small body, small brain, and survival until relatively recent times.;;;; Anthropologists Peter Brown, Michael Morwood, and their colleagues have argued that a variety of features, both primitive and derived, identified the skeleton of LB1 as that of a new species of hominin, ''H. floresiensis''.;; It is thought to have been contemporaneous with modern humans (''Homo sapiens'') on the Indonesian island of Flores. One largely complete sub-fossil skeleton (LB1) and one molar (LB2), dated at 18,000 years old, were discovered in deposits in Liang Bua Cave on Flores in 2003. Parts of seven other individuals (LB3 – LB9, the most complete being LB6), all diminutive, have been recovered as well as similarly small stone tools from horizons ranging from 94,000 to 13,000 years ago.;; The first of these remains was unearthed in 2003 and the publication date of the original description is October 2004.;; 

Early doubts that the discoveries constitute a new species were voiced by the Indonesian anthropologist Teuku Jacob, who suggested that the skull of LB1 was a microcephalic modern human, but support for species status appeared in March 2005, following publication of details of the brain of Flores Man in ''Science''.;; Subsequently several researchers, including one scientist who worked on the initial study, have disputed the 2005 study, supporting the conclusion that the skull is microcephalic.;;;; The original discoverers have argued against these interpretations and maintain that ''H. floresiensis'' is a distinct species.;;;.This is supported by the most recent study that disputes possibility of microcephaly published by paleoneurologist Dean Falk;[http://www.fsu.edu/news/2007/01/29/brain.analysis/ FSU anthropologist's brain analysis confirms ancient 'Hobbit' a separate species] Jan 29, 2007;comparing the ''H. floresiensis'' brain to ten microcephalic brains revealing distinct differences that have so far gone unanswered by critics.Furthermore, the recent discovery that ''H. floresiensis'' wrist bones are indistinguishable from those of a chimpanzee or early hominid such as australopithecus;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12667-hobbit-wrist-bones-suggests-a-distinct-species.html|New Scientist: 'Hobbit' wrist bones suggest a distinct species|accessdate=2007-09-20]; has acted as a proverbial &quot;smoking gun&quot; to where it is now generally regarded by the scientific community that ''Homo floresiensis'' was a distinct and separate species;http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/sep/21/2;. To date, the only complete cranium is that of LB1.

Discovery

The first specimens were discovered by a joint Australian-Indonesian team of paleoanthropologists and archaeologists looking on Flores for evidence of the original human migration of ''H. sapiens'' from Asia into Australia.;; They were not expecting to find a new species, and were quite surprised at the recovery of the nearly complete skeleton of a hominid they dubbed LB1 (for the first skeleton recovered at the Liang Bua Cave).Subsequent excavations recovered seven additional skeletons, dating from 38,000 to 13,000 years old, from Liang Bua limestone cave on Flores.;An arm bone, provisionally assigned to ''H. floresiensis'', is about 74,000 years old. Also widely present in this cave are sophisticated stone implements of a size considered appropriate to the 1&amp;nbsp;m tall human: these are at horizons from 95,000 to 13,000 years and are associated with juvenile ''Stegodon'', presumably the prey of LB1.;

The specimens are not fossilized, but were described in a ''Nature'' news article as having &quot;the consistency of wet blotting paper&quot; (once exposed, the bones had to be left to dry before they could be dug up). Researchers hope to find preserved mitochondrial DNA to compare with samples from similarly unfossilised specimens of ''Homo neanderthalensis'' and ''H. sapiens''. It is unlikely that useful DNA specimens exist in the available sample, as DNA degrades rapidly in warm tropical environments, sometimes in as little as a few dozen years.Also, contamination from the surrounding environment seems highly possible given the moist environment in which the specimens were found.

Anatomy
The most important and obvious identifying features of ''H. floresiensis'' are its small body and small cranial capacity.Brown and Morwood also identified a number of additional, less obvious features, that might distinguish LB1 from modern ''H. sapiens'', including the form of the teeth, the absence of a chin, and the unusually low twist in the forearm bones.Each of these putative distinguishing features has been heavily scrutinized by the scientific community, with different independent research groups reaching differing conclusions whether these features support the original designation of a new species,; or whether they identify LB1 as a severely pathological ''H. sapiens''.;The discovery of additional partial skeletons; has verified the existence of some features found in LB1, such as the lack of a chin, but Jacob and other research teams argue that these features do not distinguish LB1 from local ''H. sapiens'' morphology.; 

= Small bodies=
The type specimen for the proposed species is a fairly complete skeleton and near-complete skull proposed to be that of a 30-year-old female (LB1), nicknamed ''Little Lady of Flores'' or ''Flo'', about 1.06&amp;nbsp;m (3&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;in) in height.;This short stature is also supported by the height estimates derived from the tibia of a second skeleton (LB8), on the basis of which Morwood and colleagues suggest that LB8 might have stood 1.09&amp;nbsp;m (3&amp;nbsp;ft 7&amp;nbsp;in) high.;These estimates are outside the range of normal modern human height and is considerably shorter than the average adult height of even the physically smallest populations of modern humans, such as the African Pygmies (; These observed similarities form the basis for the establishment of the suggested phylogenetic relationship. Despite a controversial reported finding by the same team of alleged material evidence, stone tools, of a ''H. erectus'' occupation 840,000 years ago, actual remains of ''H. erectus'' itself have not been found on Flores, much less transitional forms.

To explain the small stature of ''H. floresiensis'', Brown and colleagues have suggested that in the limited food environment on Flores ''H. erectus'' underwent strong insular dwarfism,; a form of speciation also seen on Flores in several species, including a dwarf ''Stegodon'' (a group of proboscideans that was widespread throughout Asia during the Quaternary), as well as being observed on other small islands. However, the &quot;island dwarfing&quot; theory has been subjected to some criticism from Teuku Jacob and colleagues; who argue that LB1 is similar to local Rampasasa ''H. sapiens'' populations, and who point out that size can vary substantially in pygmy populations.

= Small brains=
The skull of ''H. floresiensis''.
In addition to a small body size, ''H. floresiensis'' had a remarkably small brain.The type specimen, at 380&amp;nbsp;cm³ (23&amp;nbsp;in³), is at the lower range of chimpanzees or the ancient australopithecines.;;The brain is reduced considerably relative to this species' presumed immediate ancestor ''H. erectus'', which at 980&amp;nbsp;cm³ (60&amp;nbsp;in³) had more than double the brain volume of its descendant species.; Nonetheless, the estimated brain to body mass ratio of LB1 lies between that of ''Homo erectus'' and the great apes.;;

Indeed, the discoverers have associated ''H. floresiensis'' with advanced behaviors. There is evidence of the use of fire for cooking in Liang Bua cave, and evidence of cut marks on the ''Stegodon'' bones associated with the finds.;; The species has also been associated with stone tools of the sophisticated Upper Paleolithic tradition typically associated with modern humans, who at 1310&amp;ndash;1475&amp;nbsp;cm³ (80&amp;ndash;90&amp;nbsp;in³) nearly quadruple the brain volume of ''H. floresiensis'' (with body mass increased by a factor of 2.6).Some of these tools were apparently used in the necessarily co-operation|cooperative hunting of local dwarf ''Stegodon'' by this small human species.; 

An indicator of intelligence is the size of region 10 of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, which is associated with self-awareness and is about the same size as that of modern humans, despite the much smaller overall size of the brain.;

=Additional features=
Additional features used to argue that the finds come from a population of previously unidentified hominins include the absence of a chin, the relatively low twist of the arm bones, and the width of the leg bones relative to their length.;;;The presence of each of these features has been confirmed by independent investigators; but their significance has been disputed.For example, Jacob and colleagues argue that each of these unusual features indicates some form of pathology in the LB1 skeleton.

In September of 2007, Matthew W. Tocheri, of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, announced that ''Homo floresiensis'' was indeed a separate branch on the human evolutionary chain. He and his team found the bones in the ''Homo floresiensis'' wrist to be &quot;indistinguishable from an African ape or early hominin-like wrist and nothing at all like that seen in modern humans and Neanderthals&quot;. He goes on to explain how while there are pathologies that can affect the wrist, there are none that can effectively turn a modern human wrist into that of an extinct proto-human or a modern day African ape. Once confirmed, this would mean that Neanderthal was not the last homo species to share this planet with ''Homo sapiens'', as ''Homo floresiensis'' only died out around 18,000 years ago, or 12,000 years after the last ''Homo neanderthalensis''.;;

Recent survival
The species is thought to have survived on Flores until at least as recently as 12,000 years ago making it the longest-lasting non-modern human, surviving long past the Neanderthals (''H. neanderthalensis'') which became extinct about 24,000 years ago.;

Flores remained isolated during the Wisconsin glaciation (the most recent glacial period), despite the low sea levels that united much of the rest of Sundaland, because of a deep neighboring strait. This has led the discoverers of ''H. floresiensis'' to conclude that the species or its ancestors could only have reached the isolated island by water transport, perhaps arriving in bamboo rafts around 100,000 years ago (or, if they are ''H. erectus'', then about 1 million years ago).This perceived evidence of advanced technology and cooperation on a modern human level has prompted the discoverers to hypothesize that ''H. floresiensis'' almost certainly had language.;; These suggestions have been some of the most controversial of the discoverers' findings, despite the probable high intelligence of ''H. floresiensis''.

Local geology suggests that a volcanic eruption on Flores was responsible for the demise of ''H. floresiensis'' in the part of the island under study at approximately 12,000 years ago, along with other local fauna, including the dwarf elephant ''Stegodon''.; The discoverers suspect, however, that this species may have survived longer in other parts of Flores to become the source of the ''Ebu Gogo'' stories told among the local people. The ''Ebu Gogo'' are said to have been small, hairy, language-poor cave dwellers on the scale of ''H. floresiensis''. Widely believed to be present at the time of the arrival of the first Portuguese ships during the 16th century, these strange creatures were apparently last spotted as recently as the late 19th century.;;; 

Similarly, on the island of Sumatra, there are reports of a 1–1.5&amp;nbsp;m tall humanoid, the ''Orang Pendek'', which a few professional scholars, such as Debbie Martyr and Jeremy Holden, take seriously.;; Footprints and hairs believed to be from the ''Orang Pendek'' have been recovered by two amateur explorers.;
; Analysis of these have yielded mixed results; both footprints and hairs are believed to originate from a previously undocumented species of primate;; but DNA analysis of the hairs found only human DNA.;; A possible explanation for this is that contamination by people who handled the hairs could have introduced this DNA and the original DNA could have decomposed.;; Another possible explanation is that the scholars who take these reports seriously are merely seeing what they want to see. The evidence for the Orang Pendek thus far is that of modern Homo sapiens. Scholars working on the Flores Man have noted that the ''Orang Pendek'' may also be surviving modern Flores men still living on Sumatra.

Controversies
Whether the specimens represent a new species is a controversial issue within the scientific community. Professor Teuku Jacob, chief paleontologist of the Indonesian Gadjah Mada University and other scientists reportedly disagree with the placement of the new finds into a new species of ''Homo'', stating instead, &quot;It is a sub-species of ''Homo sapiens'' classified under the Austrolomelanesid race&quot;. He contends that the find is from a 25–30 year-old omnivorous subspecies of ''H. sapiens'', and not a 30-year-old female of a new species. He is convinced that the small skull is that of a mentally defective modern human, probably a Pygmy, suffering from the genetic disorder microcephaly, which produces a small brain and skull.

In early December 2004, Professor Jacob removed most of the remains from Soejono's institution, Jakarta's National Research Centre of Archaeology, for his own research without the permission of the Centre's directors.;;;;;;;; Some expressed fears that, like the Dead Sea Scrolls, important scientific evidence would be sequestered by a small group of scientists who neither allowed access by other scientists nor published their own research. Jacob eventually returned the remains with portions severely damaged;http://www.smh.com.au/news/Science/Hobbits-triumph-tempered-by-tragedy/2005/03/04/1109700677461.html; and missing two leg bones on 23 February, 2005;; to the worldwide consternation of his peers.Reports noted the condition of the returned remains; &quot;(including) long, deep cuts marking the lower edge of the Hobbit's jaw on both sides, said to be caused by a knife used to cut away the rubber mould&quot;; &quot;the chin of a second Hobbit jaw was snapped off and glued back together. Whoever was responsible misaligned the pieces and put them at an incorrect angle&quot;; and, &quot;The pelvis was smashed, destroying details that reveal body shape, gait and evolutionary history&quot;;; and causing the discovery team leader Professor Morwood to remark &quot;It's sickening, Jacob was greedy and acted totally irresponsibly.&quot;;http://www.smh.com.au/news/Science/Hobbits-triumph-tempered-by-tragedy/2005/03/04/1109700677461.html;Jacob, however, denied any wrongdoing.He stated that such damages occurred during transport from Yogyakarta back to Jakarta; despite the physical evidence to the contrary that the jawbone had been brokenwhile making a mold of the hobbit, and when trying to repair it &quot;rammed the two halves together at the wrong angle, stuck bone fragments in the cracks, and hidden the mess with a thick coating of glue&quot;.;;

However, prior to Professor Jacob's heist, a CT scan was taken of the skull and in 2005, a computer-generated model of the skull of Homo floresiensis was undertaken, and analysed by a team headed by Dean Falk of Florida State University. The results were published in ''Science'' in Feb. 2005. The authors of the study claimed that brainpan was not that of a pygmy nor an individual with a malformed skull and brain, supporting the view that it is a new species.; However, in October 2005 ''Science'' published an additional study headed by Alfred Czarnetzki, Carsten M. Pusch and Jochen Weber. This disagreed with the findings of the February 2005 study and concluded that the skull of LB1 is consistent with microcephaly.;; 

The results of the Feb. 2005 study were also questioned in the May 19, 2006, issue of the journal ''Science'', in which Robert D. Martin of the Field Museum in Chicago and co-authors argued that the 2005 study had not compared the skull with a typical example of adult microcephaly. Martin and his co-authors concluded that the skull was probably microcephalic. Martin argued that the brain is far too small to be a separate dwarf species; if it were, he wrote, the 400-cubic-centimeter brain would indicate a creature only one foot in height, which would be one-third the size of the discovered skeleton.;&quot;'Hobbit' Bones Said to Be of Deformed Human&quot;. ''Los Angeles Times'', Saturday, May 20, 2006.; In the September 5, 2006, issue of the ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', a group of scientists from Indonesia, Australia, and the United States came to the same conclusion as Dr. Martin by examining bone and skull structure.; 

In response, Brown and Morwood have criticized these recent findings by claiming that the scientists came to incorrect conclusions about bone and skull structure and mistakenly attributed the height of ''Homo floresiensis'' to microcephaly.;; They also pointed to studies by other scientists who rejected the argument that the individual was diseased. Falk's team replied to the critics of their Feb. 2005 study, standing by their results and insisting that the skull is very different from microcephalic specimens.; Bill Jungers, a morphologist from Stony Brook University, examined the skull and concluded that the skeleton displays &quot;no trace of disease&quot;. However, Jochen Weber of the Leopoldina Hospital in Schweinfurt argues that &quot;we can't rule out the possibility that he suffered from microcephaly.&quot;;[http://www.accuca.conectia.es/noticias/2006/a_huge_fight_over_a_little_man.htm A Huge Fight over a Little Man, by Rafaela von Bredow, ''Der Spiegel'', September 1, 2006.]; Debbie Argue of the Australian National University has also published a study in the ''Journal of Human Evolution'' which rejects microcephaly and concludes that the finds are indeed a new species.;[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2006-07-16-hobbit-argument_x.htm USA Today: The hullabaloo about hobbits]; 

=Evidence against microcephaly=
On January 29, 2007, Falk published a new study supporting the claim to species status ;[http://www.fsu.edu/news/2007/01/29/brain.analysis/ FSU anthropologist's brain analysis confirms ancient 'Hobbit' a separate species] Jan 29, 2007; offering the most conclusive evidence to date that the claims of a microcephalic ''Homo sapiens'' were not credible.In this new study Falk examines 3-D computer generated models of an additional 9 microcephalic brains and 10 normal human brains, revealing the Floresiensis skulls having shape more aligned with normal human brains, but also having unique features which is consistent with what one would expect in a new species.Comparing the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as the portion in the back of the skull revealed a brain highly developed, completely unlike the microcephalic brain, and advanced in ways different from human brains.;January 29 issue of the journal ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States''; This finding also answered past criticisms that the floresiensis brain was simply too small to be capable of the intelligence required to create the tools found in their proximity.Falk concludes the onus is now upon the critics that continue to claim microcephaly to produce a brain of a microcephalic that bears resemblance to the floresiensis brain.

=Laron syndrome=
On June 27, 2007, Hershkovitz et al. published a new paper arguing that the morphological features ofFloresiensis are essentially indistinguishable from those of Laron syndrome, casting the species claim once more into doubt;[http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/flores/hershkovitz_laron_syndrome_2007.html Another diagnosis for a hobbit] July 3, 2007;;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.20655 Comparative skeletal features between Homo floresiensis and patients with primary growth hormone insensitivity (Laron syndrome)] 17 April 2007;. 

=Wrist bone structure=
On September 22, 2007 it was reported that Matthew W. Tocheri of the Smithsonian's National Museum observed bones within the wrist of ''H. floresiensis'' which appear entirely different from those seen in modern humans and are basically indistinguishable from an African ape or early hominin-like wrist bone structure.This indicates that ''Homo floresiensis'' may in fact be an early hominin and not a modern human with a physical disorder.;;;;;;;;
