''Ninja Gaiden'' is a console action-adventure game developed by Team Ninja and published by Tecmo. It was released in 2004 for the Xbox video game console, and starts off a whole new ''Ninja Gaiden'' story and universe, different from the older Nintendo Entertainment System ''Ninja Gaiden'' series.It has received much critical acclaim, with several publications proclaiming it the best as well as one of the most difficult video games ever made, inducting it into their Halls of Fame.

''Ninja Gaiden'' marks the first foray into the third-person, three-dimensional action-adventure market for the ''Ninja Gaiden'' series.Taking place in Japan and the fictional country of Vigoor, the game follows the ninja, Ryu Hayabusa as he fights hordes of enemies in a variety of environments to retrieve the stolen Dark Dragon Blade. An online tournament was held for it shortly after its release. The qualifiers played over Xbox Live established record-breaking participation, and culminated in the finalists having their showdown at the Tokyo Game Show 2004.

The game mechanics of ''Ninja Gaiden'' have gradually evolved through downloadable contents and two re-releases, ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' for the Xbox in 2005, and ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' for the PlayStation 3 in 2007. Its saga will be continued in ''Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword'' on the Nintendo DS, and later on in ''Ninja Gaiden II'' on the Xbox 360.

Gameplay
The player controls Ryu Hayabusa, guiding him in a third-person shooter|third person view, fighting foes and exploring the environment of the 3D world. Except for a few situations dictated by the story, Ryu is unrestrained in his exploration, running through the streets, jumping and running up and along walls, and swinging from pole to pole. Although the game world is loaded in stages, the load times are said to be negligible.; &quot;Not too many videogames can say their fighting system is perfect. Ninja Gaiden has earned the right to say this, because Ninja Gaiden literally has no problems with its gameplay. You will find out right away how easy it is to use the combat system featured in Ninja Gaiden, but also how hard it is to master. [...] The loading times are quite short and infrequent.&quot;
;; &quot;One big factor for a title as beautiful as this one would be loading times, but Team Ninja has you covered.The loading time for a new level is very brief and it loads the entire area...or so it seems.That is where Team Ninja pulls off a little Ninjitsu magic of their own.As you enter a room there is a short transition where Ryu walks through the doorway, I suspect that there is a little burst loading done at that point.It is fairly seamless and it ensures that you are only loading an area once.&quot;;

''Ninja Gaiden's'' standard game mode, Story Mode, follows the pacing of the typical action-adventure game, where the protagonist starts off weak at the beginning of the story and can be built up to have a larger life bar, more powerful weapons and magical ability through items or purchases, by the end of the it. The player's performance in this mode is based purely on the karma score, with &quot;Master Ninja&quot; as the highest rank, and &quot;Ninja Dog&quot; as the lowest.

Another gaming experience was introduced in ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' and ''Sigma'', in the form of Mission Mode. The missions are short sessions of pure combat action, and each mission typically comes with its own equipment loadout for the player. The highest scores for each mission are accumulated for the player's Mission Mode score.

Players can upload their scores to online ranking boards for both modes, and compete with other players to get the best scores. Besides this, the games also promote replayability with the large number of Mission Mode missions, and unlockable costumes and emulated games for completing Story Mode on different difficulties.

=Combat system=
Clockwise from top left: Weapons menu, Lunar Ultimate Technique, Ryu casting the Inferno ninpo, Kitetsu Ultimate TechniqueReviewers have praised ''Ninja Gaiden'' as having one of the deeper combat engines for a Xbox game, the smooth interaction and responsiveness of its controls.; &quot;At its core is one of the best combat systems ever devised, wherein moves (and combinations thereof) are executed just as they would be in a fighting game like Soul Calibur but are more often directed against waves and waves of enemies, rather than just one opponent at a time.&quot;
;; &quot;This gripping feeling is accentuated by the game's controls, which are both fluid and responsive, whether in the pure platform-like sections (think Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time, especially when Ryu's running along walls or flipping himself out of pits) or the core of the game's challenge, the combat sections.&quot;
;;; &quot;No, the best way to make up your mind regarding Team Ninja's epic action opus (and its Black expansion pack) is to examine your feelings on it as you're busy leaping over enemies, running on walls and lopping snarling heads off. It's very likely that, during those moments, you'll come to the conclusion that the game is perfect, or at least as close to perfect as any game has managed in this generation. [...] More importantly, the controls are absolutely spot-on, responding immediately to your commands to the point where it feels as if there's really no hunk of plastic tethered to a cable between you and the on-screen action.&quot;; Using only the control stick and three buttons, the player is able to make Ryu block, dodge and attack with ease. Ryu's defence is unbreakable by most attacks, though he can still be grabbed. He can also dodge attacks with a 'reverse-wind' (tumble and roll).

Ryu has a multitude of weapons to choose from. With the light swords (Dragon Sword, Kitetsu, etc), he is able to perform quick attacks, the Flying Swallow (high speed leaping slash) - cutting through foes, as well as his signature Izuna Drop (leaping spinning piledriver) smashing foes into the ground. Heavy weapons like the Dabilahro, are slow but powerful. Flails and staves let him string together long combos of attacks. Shurikens and arrows make up the rest of his arsenal, allowing him to hurt foes at a distance.

By absorbing essences given off by slain enemies, Ryu can unleash super powerful attacks known as Ultimate Techniques. Each weapon has its own unique Ultimate Technique, and besides dealing out heavy damage to the unfortunate foes caught in them, it also grants Ryu invulnerability during the attack. In the later versions of ''Ninja Gaiden'', these techniques award karma points, making them an integral part of high scoring play.

Lastly, fueled by his ki, Ryu can cast ninpos (magic spells), harming his foes with fireballs, ice storms or bolts of lightning while avoiding damage from their attacks.

Plot and setting
A meeting in the monastery. Note the Byzantine architecture of the hall.''Ninja Gaidens world consists of fictional locations between two countries, Japan and the fictional Vigoor Empire. For the Japanese locations, the ninja fortress and the Hayabusa village are designed in the typical Japanese Japanese architecture#Heian period|Heian period architecture, set amongst the mountains.

The Vigoor Empire is an imaginative environment, consisting of a variety of real world cultural influences. The city of Tairon bears the marks of Islamic architecture with Arabic letterings found on various gates and structures. The monastery bears the looks of Byzantine architecture with the large spacious hall, multiple levels of windows and archways. The hidden underground evokes the influence of ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, while the pyramid is that of a Sumerian ziggurat. Overall, ''Ninja Gaiden'' is a mixture of unrelated styles. Itagaki has admitted to this, saying &quot;I just put everything in that I wanted to create!&quot;;

=Characters=

The protagonist and the only playable character in ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' is the super ninja, List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Ryu Hayabusa 2|Ryu Hayabusa.;
;;
; A man of few words, he works alone in his quest. He ends up rescuing the fiend hunter, List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Supporting characters 2|Rachel (who is another playable character in ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'') quite a number of times over the course of the game.

The bulk of enemies the protagonist faces in the game are Fiends, humans turned into supernatural creatures through cursing of their blood.;Rachel: It's hard to believe they were ever humans, isn't it? Ryu: Human? Rachel: Anyone with susceptibility to the curse, whether they are a saint or a sinner, can succumb to it and become a Fiend. 
; Of the three Greater Fiends,;Ryu: So, the Greater Fiends have a soul, don't they? Rachel: [...] There are only three of them, Doku, my sister and another who guards the Emperor. 
; only List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Leaders of the Fiends|Doku plays a major role in the storyline, being the one who starts off Ryu's quest for vengeance, by killing his village, stealing the Dark Dragon Blade, and having turned List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Leaders of the Fiends|Alma into a Fiend.

=Story=
Taking place two years before the first ''Dead or Alive'' game, the story starts off with Ryu invading the Shadow clan ninja fortress to pay a visit to his uncle, List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Ninjas|Murai who is the clan's leader. During the visit, Ryu receives news of the Hayabusa village being raided and rushes back to his village. He encounters Doku who is stealing away the Dark Dragon Blade. Their confrontration results in Ryu getting cut down by Doku. The scene ends with the Hayabusa's spiritual animal, a falcon watching over Ryu's fallen body.

Ryu fights with Doku.With information given by Murai, a fully recovered Ryu sets off to Vigoor, seeking vengeance;Ryu: I'm looking for a Greater Fiend named Doku. Do you know him? Rachel: Why are you looking for him? Ryu: I'm going to kill him. 
; and retrieval of the Blade. Guided by List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Supporting characters 2|Ayane, Ryu fights through the streets of Tairon, cutting down those who stand in his way. In his adventures, he meets the Fiend Hunter, Rachel and the enigmatic swordsmith, List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Supporting characters 2|Muramasa, both of whom provide him aid.

Ryu kills a lot of fiends, even defeating the Greater Fiend, Alma, and has a final showdown with Doku in a labyrinth. Doku's spirit is defeated and banished, but he casts the blood curse on Ryu with his last breath.;Spirit Doku: Receive the curse, become a Fiend. 
; To overcome this curse and to recover the Dark Dragon Blade, Ryu enters the palace and overcomes the List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Leaders of the Fiends|Holy Vigoor Emperor in the latter's own realm.

With the Emperor's hold on his realm gone, it starts to collapse. Ryu loses his grip on the Dark Dragon Blade while escaping. It is picked up by the List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Ninjas|Dark Disciple who was shadowing Ryu throughout his adventure. Unmasking himself to be Murai, the whole ordeal is revealed to be a set up by him to infuse the Blade with the souls harnessed from Ryu's quest of vengeance, thereby restoring its evil power.;Dark Disciple: Gamov, so the Dark Dragon grows in power with each killing. 
;;Gamov: Don't you see? The Dark Dragon is now truly an evil blade. His Excellency the Dark Disciple has been waiting for this very moment! 
;

In this final duel, Murai despite possessing the fully powered evil blade, is of no match to Ryu. The story ends with Ryu shattering the Dark Dragon Blade with the True Dragon Sword. Simply stating &quot;It's over...&quot;, Ryu turns himself into a falcon and flies back to the Hayabusa village.
;
Development
The &quot;Next-Generation Ninja Gaiden Project&quot; began in 1999; it was originally intended to be a game for the Sega NAOMI arcade system board. The game's development cycle was plagued by several delays and changes of platform: first to the Sega Dreamcast, then as a launch title for the PlayStation 2.;
; It was a surprise then when Tecmo announced during E3 2002 that ''Ninja Gaiden'' would be exclusive to the Xbox,;
;;
; especially when their own online poll showed the GameCube as the fans' overwhelming choice platform for the game.;
;

The game director, Tomonobu Itagaki had stated his desire for this game to be a violent action game at heart.;
; He intended for a difficult game which primarily challenges players on their reflexes instead of their memorization of layouts and timings like in the old NES series.;
;;
; Itagaki sought to attract casual and hardcore gamers with a well-made game which integrated high quality smooth flowing graphics, with responsive controls, and immersive gaming experience. As a brand new take on the ''Ninja Gaiden'' universe, the game made a few references to the old series like the theme of a pair of good and evil swords, reused attacks from the old games, and new imaginings of old foes.

The release date of the game kept slipping and Tecmo finally announced that it would be released in 2004.;
;;
;;
; The demo disc of ''Ninja Gaiden'' came with the March 2004 edition of Famitsu Xbox,;
;;
; on 12 February 2004. In the demo, the player is restricted to the ninja fortress in the retail version's chapter one. However, Ryu starts off with three fully upgraded melee weapons, two types of shurikens, and a bow. He is also equipped with the Art of Inazuma ninpo, which shoots out bolts of lightning. This gives the player a taste of the later features in the retail version. The demo offers only the Normal and Hard difficulty levels to choose from.

''Ninja Gaiden''s American retail release was two weeks earlier than its Japanese release,;
; and was accompanied by a commercial;
; and the launching of the official website.;
; Those who had pre-ordered the game on Tecmo's site could purchase ''Ninja Gaiden'' merchandises at a discount.;
; Despite the retail release, work continued on and downloadable contents in the form of ''Hurricane Pack''s were announced to be available for download via Xbox Live from August 2004.;
; The ''Pack''s are part of the qualifying process for the Master Ninja Tournament World Wide Finals.

''Hurricane Pack 1'' was available for download since August 9, 2004. It reused ''Ninja Gaidens Story Mode, but added several new foes like the blue furred humanoid List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Fiends|Cat Fiends, the List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Fiends|Dino Fiends wearing ''Triceratops'' skull masks, and upgraded versions of the Vigoor military forces. Modifications were made to the scoring system to reward clearing only encounters for the first time, and for fast kills. The player is now able to manually rotate the camera, and an Intercept technique (similar to Soul Calibur II's Guard Impact),;
; was introduced.

''Hurricane Pack 2'' was available for download since September 27, 2004. It integrated all the features of ''Hurricane Pack 1'', but changed the story and game world. With the aid of a new weapon, the Lunar, the player has to fight through several rounds of combats to rescue Rachel from the twin Ancient Fiends, List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Fiends|Nicchae and List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Fiends|Ishtaros. Going up through the palace, and into the nether world, the player can only shop and save after certain rounds of combats with old foes and a few new foes, like the slide tackling List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Fiends|Crow Shadows and the great sword wielding List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Fiends|Nightmare Fiends.

Tecmo announced in May's E3 2005 that ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' for the Xbox would be Team Ninja's next project.;
; The game was shortly listed as playable for the Tokyo Game Show 2005,;
; and was released on schedule in September 2005 with loads of content for a comparatively low price.;
; Those who pre-ordered the game received a free exclusive t-shirt as well.;
; Considered to be the complete ''Ninja Gaiden'' experience by the designer Tomonobu Itagaki himself,;
; ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' integrated all of the features in the two ''Hurricane Packs'', along with new features of its own, such asMission Mode, and the easy difficulty - Ninja Dog. According to interviews with Itagaki, the Ninja Dog difficulty was added only grudgingly.;
; He felt the standard difficulty implemented in the game was reasonable for any casual player if they had persevered through the difficult parts.;
; However, due to the strong outcries to the game's difficulty, he instituted the Ninja Dog mode as a double-edged compromise: it can only be accessed through dying three successive times (similar to the Special Edition of ''Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening#Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition|Devil May Cry 3'') within the first stage, at which point the player is asked, &quot;Do you wish to abandon the way of the ninja?&quot; If the player accepts, the game enters Ninja Dog and continues on under a condescending atmosphere - pink ribbons for accessories, Ayane taking on an attitude to Ryu, etc.

In the September 2006 issue of Famitsu, Tecmo announced its next project in the ''Ninja Gaiden'' series would be remaking ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' into ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' for the PlayStation 3.;
;;
; This was officially announced by Sony at the Tokyo Game Show 2006.;
; Yosuke Hayashi was appointed the game director of this remake, and Eidos managed to purchase the publishing rights for Europe and North America. Tomonobu Itagaki while having no direct involvement in the project, had stated ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' is only for PlayStation owners who never got the chance to experience what ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' had to offer, which is why this version will remain exclusively for the PS3.;
;

GameStop announced in April 2007 that it would be releasing limited number of copies of ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma Collectors Edition'' for the North American market.;
; They were sold at ten US dollars more than the standard edition, with the only extra exclusive content being a 'behind-the-scenes' DVD of Team Ninja, as the advertised exclusive code was applicable for the standard editions as well. Hopes for a ''Collectors Edition'' for Europe were dashed with a followup announcement by Eidos.;
;;
; In Japan, the Japan-based singer, Leah Dizon was contracted to be the celebrity promoter for the game, starring in and singing the song for its commercial there.;
; Her autographed posters were also prizes for the game's Japanese launch.;
; Limited supplies of free t-shirts were given to those who pre-ordered the game for the North American launch.;
;

''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''s demo was released on April 26, 2007, over the PlayStation Network. Like the original ''Ninja Gaiden''s demo, the player is restricted to chapter one's game world. However the demo unlocks the next higher difficulty when the player completes it on a lower difficulty. The player can also play as Rachel in a separate mission. The demo exhibited a scoring glitch which resulted in ridiculously high scores on the leaderboards to the dismay of many ''Ninja Gaiden'' veterans.

Being rated as a 'Mature' video game, ''Ninja Gaiden'' can retain its heavy gore content (blood, violence, decapitations, grotesque monsters) without any censorship. However, the ratings systems for certain countries prohibit beheadings from being depicted in them. Several of these decisions were based on public opinion over current events, and as such there are differences in the rulings between versions.

Despite heavy suspicions that the European release of the game would be censored in certain aspects, Microsoft reassured Europe in March 2004 that the gore would be left intact.;
;;
; A month later, however they admitted the European PAL version would exclude decapitation of human foes.;
;;
;;
; While the submitted material was uncensored,;
; German law forbids games featuring the decapitations portrayed in ''Ninja Gaiden'', to be released to those 18 years old and above. As such, decapitations were removed from the PAL retail versions. However, a year later, ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' was accredited with the same rating by the USK, but the decapitations were left untouched in the PAL versions.

Since 2006, Japan has become more stringent with CERO, its violence rating system. Therefore, ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' cannot feature human decapitation unless Tecmo is willing to accept a 'Z' rating for the game. As it is sold in Japan under the 'D' rating, there are no decapitations in the NTSC/J version of ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''.


Master Ninja Tournaments
The original purpose of the first ''Hurricane Pack'' was for the Master Ninja World Tournament qualification, and the second pack was a separate tournament on its own. With the events' conclusions, the packs' ranking boards are left up online for players to continue competing their scores. Tecmo's planned to hold a Master Ninja Tournament for all ''Ninja Gaiden'' players to participate in. Making use of the online ranking capability of the game, three rounds of competition plus regional playoffs were held to select the finalists who would proceed to the Master Tournament World Championship. Their flight and accommodation were paid for by the organizers.;
; Registration for the competition started on May 3, 2004.;
;;
;

Master Ninja Tournament 1, the first round of competition was decided by players playing ''Ninja Gaiden''s Story Mode on Normal difficulty, and submitting their scores to the online scoreboard. It was limited to North American and Canadian players. It began on May 12, 2004. The participation rate was immense, and was reported to be the highest participated tournament on Xbox Live then.;
; The deadline for score submission was June 4, 2004. Prizes were t-shirts and wristbands.;
;

Controversy however surrounded the first round.;
; The official rules were only posted 10 days before the end of the first round, and the initial conception of there being 100 qualifiers for the next round was revealed to be mistaken - only the top three would receive a bokken signed by Tomonobu Itagaki, and the chance to proceed to the championship.;
; The first placed player, Ryan Martoni aka 'taibhse' obtained a score which many players declared as unattainable by fair means. Even Martoni himself was uncertain how he got his score.

'maruyo' trying out the game for the finals at the welcome party.Master Ninja Tournament 2 was the second round of the competition. Participating players had to register by August 2, 2004 (later extended to August 9, 2004),;
; download ''Hurricane Pack 1'', complete it, and submit their scores by August 22, 2004 for the North American and Japanese regions; September 2, 2004 for the European region. The European region participants got to win the same prizes as the North American region had in Master Ninja Tournament 1,;
; however only the top European champion could proceed to the championship. The European champion turned out to be Darren Forman aka 'Kayin Amoh'.

The Ninja Gaiden Master Tournament World Championship proceeding on.Of the three Master Ninja Tournament 1 winners, only one of them would make it to the championship by beating out the other two in this round. Derek Ian Edwin Kisman aka 'SnapDragon', easily trounced the other two, and earned his spot. The highest Master Ninja Tournament 2 score for the North American region also qualified for the finals. There was controversy as the top North American player nicknamed 'Saryah' was disqualified for failing to declare his age in his gamer profile, and David Barlog aka 'Captain Tuttle' the second highest scorer was passed over for being unable to present his passport on time. The spot finally went to Grant Goodwin aka 'Grantisimo', who squeezed in as the third highest scoring North American just before the deadline as stated in the rules.;
; The top two Japanese scorers, 'maruyo' and 'panzerorta40148' rounded off the finalists to the championship.

Like the first round, the second round of the competition broke the record for online participation of a tournament on Xbox Live.;
;

The Ninja Gaiden Master Tournament World Championship was held at the Tokyo Game Show 2004 on September 25. The five finalists played simultaneously an extracted version of ''Hurricane Pack 2'', on raised walkways while commentators called out the action. The winner was judged by the highest score, and Yasunori Otsuka aka 'panzerorta40148' outscored the rest to take the championship. He was presented a plaque by Tomonobu Itagaki himself.;
;;
;

Master Ninja Tournament 3 was a comparatively low key affair started on September 27, 2004.;
; The players had to download ''Hurricane Pack 2'' and submit their scores by October 22, 2004. Only the top scorer would be declared the winner and be awarded with a plethora of prizes including a copy of ''Ninja Gaiden'' signed by Tomonobu Itagaki and a copy of ''Dead or Alive Ultimate''. The top scoring 100 players received ''Ninja Gaiden'' boxers or wristbands. 50 pairs of Ninja &quot;Dog&quot; boxers were awarded to random participants.
;

Versions and merchandise
Two versions of ''Ninja Gaiden'' were produced, ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' and ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''. On the whole, they are all the same games, possessing the same story regarding Ryu and the Dark Dragon Blade. The game engine remained the same, but was tweaked for the later two versions. ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' is considered to be the final version of ''Ninja Gaiden'' with all the features of the latter, and a Mission Mode. In moving the game from the older generation Xbox to the later generation PlayStation 3, the graphics were improved for ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''.

=''Ninja Gaiden Black''=
''Ninja Gaiden Black'';North American box cover
''Ninja Gaiden Black'' is ''Ninja Gaiden'' integrated with the contents of the two ''Hurricane Packs'', and a Mission Mode. Tomonobu Itagaki has tweaked it to be more difficult than the original release, especially on the higher difficulties. Several bosses including List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Leaders of the Fiends|Spirit Doku and the Dark Disciple attack faster and more furiously, plus a variety of dangerous new foes have been added to make life even harder. Furthermore, players who have played ''Ninja Gaiden'' will find the Flying Swallow move, which could previously dominate almost any foe thrown against Ryu, has been heavily toned down. On Hard difficulty and above, foes block the Flying Swallow more frequently, forcing players to adapt to a new style of fighting. There are even a couple of new enemies having moves specifically to punish usage of the Flying Swallow against them.

A Vigoor soldier counterattacks Ryu's Flying Swallow move''Hurricane Pack 1s design, along with several new in-game cutscenes were effectively integrated into Story Mode, and playable on all difficulty levels, including the new Ninja Dog and Master Ninja difficulty. Encounters were added on higher levels of difficulty to surprise players on their first play, and almost all foes were given grabbing, guard breaking or crushing attacks. This coupled with the increase in the enemies' aggressiveness made the player more wary on their toes, and less likely to 'turtle' in ''Ninja Gaiden Black''.

New elements are continually introduced as the player clears the higher difficulties with the aid of the Lunar and Smoke Bombs (a new projectile which aids in distracting enemies). As the player attempts the higher difficulties, he will encounter foes from the ''Hurricane Packs'', as well as new ones, like explosive bats, flame ninjas (red-clad ninjas whose attacks inflict additional flame damage), and Ryu's evil shadows, the List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Fiends|Doppelganger Fiends. New costumes for Ryu were also available for the player to unlock, as well as the ''Ninja Gaiden arcade game'' (which took the place of the three bonus unlockable NES games in ''Ninja Gaiden'').

Mission Mode introduced 46 missions concentrating on combat in small arenas. The majority of the missions are new scenarios, while several are modified versions of fights found in Story Mode. The game the finalists played in the World Wide Master Ninja Tournament 2004 finalists was implemented as one of the missions. The longest mission is Eternal Legend, which is ''Hurricane Pack 2'' implemented on ''Ninja Gaiden Black''s engine.

=''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''=
''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'';North American box cover
''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' is basically a reworked version of ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' with some changes to it. Contrary to claims of this being the &quot;more complete&quot; version,;
;;

;;
; almost all of the bonus features from the two previous versions were excluded from this version. Unlockable costumes were reduced to only two, and the old NES and arcade games which can be unlocked previously were eliminated. The introductory movie chronicling the legend of the Dark Dragon Blade and the Dragon Sword was also no longer in the game.

Graphics were overhauled to High-definition video|high definition standards. Vast changes were made to the layout of a few environments. A great number of new save and shop locations were added, and Rachel's three chapters were simply inserted amongst Ryu's Story Mode chapters. New foes, like the biker List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Vigoor military|MVAPs, the fish-men List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Fiends|girtablilu, and the wisp-like List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Fiends|phantoms, were introduced with the two new bosses, List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Vigoor military|Gamov and List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Vigoor military|Alternator, with quite a few changes made to the specifications (AI, damage, etc) of the old foes. The player can fight these foes with the new weapon, a pair of katanas, the Dragon's Claw &amp; Tiger's Fang.

Ryu's reverse wind technique was replaced with that of his ninja foes. He can now fight on water, and shoot arrows in mid-air. The most prominent change allowed the player to use restoration items without going through the menus. The controller can also be shaken to increase a casted ninpo's power. If the player had played the demo before starting the very first game on the retail version, a bonus amount of yellow essence will be awarded based on the player's achievements in the demo.

From August 30, 2007 onwards, Survival Mode is available in the form of three separate packages for ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' on the PlayStation Network, each costing a small fee to download.;
; Each package adds a set of themed missions (Weapon Master, Speed Master, Rachel Master) to the new Survival Mode option.;
; The player goes through the missions without any restoration item, and keeps fighting enemies until the character's life is reduced to zero. Online rankings primarily keep track of the player's individual mission records, in terms of the number of kills.

=Merchandises=
Tecmo produces several merchandises for its own products, and ''Ninja Gaiden'' is no exception. Its online shop carries mostly apparel in the form of caps, wristbands, t-shirts, etc. Most of these were produced for the launches of the ''Ninja Gaiden'' games, or for the Master Ninja Tournaments. The original soundtrack of the game has also been released to the music industry.

Kotobukiya was contracted to produce PVC figures for the collectible industry. The statues are in the 1:6 scale modeling|1/6th scale, ranging from 10.6 to 12.4 inches tall. As of now, only statues of Ryu, Ayane, Kureha, and Rachel have been produced.;

''Ninja Gaiden'' received near universal critical acclaim. GameSpot acclaimed it as &quot;one of the best most challenging action adventure games ever made.&quot; IGN said it &quot;sets a new standard for third-person action games in terms of length, depth, speed, and gore.&quot; It has also gained a reputation for being one of the most difficult games of all time.;
;;
; ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' despite being an enhancement of ''Ninja Gaiden'' still managed to awe its reviewers. GameSpot hailed it having the best visual and audio presentation on the Xbox and its new features, &quot;mission mode distills the game down to its purest essentials&quot;. IGN called its release &quot;a rare and welcome day&quot; for a re-release which can &quot;bring your excitement levels back to the first time you played the game.&quot;

From a technical viewpoint, ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' were regarded by the reviewers as epitomes of Xbox programming, fully using and pushing to the limits the resources of the console while still performing fluidly. GameSpot was floored by their &quot;Absolutely first-rate presentation--visuals and audio still second-to-none&quot; while IGN claimed their standards were such &quot;that can make you momentarily forget about the next generation of consoles&quot;. When the Xbox 360 was released, ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' were listed among the Xbox's top games and set for backward compatibility in all three regions right at the very start.;
;;;;
;

When ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' was released, the reviewing community was divided in its opinion over the technical aspects. While EGM gushed over the updated graphics, calling it &quot;a gorgeous reworking of the modern ninja classic&quot;, Pro-G was harsh on it, saying they are average by next-gen standards with occasional &quot;tearing, jagged edges and miss matched collision between bloodstains and walls.&quot; Frequent loadings unseen in the Xbox versions (which refuse to go away despite installing the game on the local hard drive), as well as previous recognized flaws remaining unfixed were on the lists of complaints, characterized by EGM bemoaning &quot;weird glitches (sync problems that make the screen &quot;tear&quot; when the camera moves, odd bouts of loading where the screen briefly fades to gray, even in combat)&quot; made the game &quot;feel like a bit of a slapdash port.&quot;

''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''s lack of new attractive features raised the question on the value of a remake of a remake of a game. Pro-G stated none of ''Sigma''s features made it worthwhile as a full priced game which &quot;has, in effect, been available for years in one form or another&quot; while Eurogamer said ''Sigma'' lacked the &quot;wow factor&quot;, compared to the advancements found in ''God of War'' ''1'' and ''2''. EGM mocked the controller-shaking to power up a ninpo as a &quot;foolishly tacked-on Sixaxis functionality&quot; and &quot;silly&quot;. Rachel's implementation as a playable character was dampened with IGN wishing they could &quot;get back to Ryu's sections simply because he's more fun to play&quot;, though DailyGame said her slowness brings &quot;much-needed respite for newcomers and provide something new for experienced players.&quot;;
;

The games have become quite well known throughout the gaming community for its difficulty; See [http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/08 ''Penny Arcade'' - &quot;A Brief Index of Difficulty&quot;] for a concise summary of fan reaction; see also Tycho's [http://www.penny-arcade.com/2004/03/08 comment]: &quot;Shit ''damn'' Ninja Gaiden is hard, it's so hard that your ''friends'' will die. It's also completely great - once you've gone a few levels, just start a new game real quick and take a look at the guys you thought were bad-asses before. Those guys are ''feather pillows'' compared to the beasts and murderers you rub up against later.&quot; Tycho's later [http://www.penny-arcade.com/2004/12/27 comment]: &quot;When you first start playing Ninja Gaiden you might be overwhelmed with its difficulty - that was certainly true in my case. In fact, it was difficult to the degree that it was utterly demoralizing and it ended up on the shelf underneath something else so I wouldn't constantly be reminded of my deficiencies.&quot;; which is both a blessing and a curse. While ''Ninja Gaiden'' appeals to gamers who like Pro-G desire a &quot;bloody hard, but also bloody good&quot; challenge, casual gamers seem to find the learning curve daunting. IGN enthused about ''Ninja Gaiden Black''s difficulty but cautioned those with lesser ability will unlikely be able to &quot;get as much out of this game as others due to the incredible difficulty of most of the new content.&quot;

One common criticism of ''Ninja Gaiden'' and its offshoots, is with the camera placement. While the default camera controls are adequate for most fights in centering the action on Ryu and his surroundings, there are certain fights where the camera is locked on a certain object (usually a boss), or loses track of Ryu. Although reviewers acknowledged the rotational control of the camera implemented since the ''Hurricane Packs'' is an improvement, it is of no help when the camera angle is locked.

=Legacy=
''Ninja Gaiden'' spawned two re-releases, ''Ninja Gaiden Black'', and ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''. ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' has accounted for 1.5 million copies sold to consumers, while Tecmo has shipped 500,000 copies of ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' to the retailers as of August, 2007.;
; In recognition of its quality, CNET and GameSpot Asia have inducted ''Ninja Gaiden'' into their Hall of Fame.;
;;
; ''Ninja Gaiden''s story is to be continued in ''Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword'', and further on in ''Ninja Gaiden II'', both of which are to be developed under Tomonobu Itagaki.

Clive Thompson focused on ''Ninja Gaiden'' in his Slate's article on the rewards of conquering difficult games.;
; In it, he says that while some games are hard just to frustrate and hinder players, overcoming ''Ninja Gaiden''s rewards you with &quot;a sort of exhausted exhilaration, like finally reaching the end of ''War and Peace''&quot;. ''Ninja Gaiden'' is recognised as a game which has successfully struck that balance between challenge and reward.
