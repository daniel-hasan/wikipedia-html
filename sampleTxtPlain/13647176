&quot;Crumbling Land&quot; is a song by Pink Floyd from the soundtrack album of the film ''Zabriskie Point''. It is an up-tempo, country-styled song. In the booklet of Zabriskie Point soundtrack's reissue, there is a note about what David Gilmour said about the song in an interview; he described that the song's &quot;a kind of country &amp; western number which he [Antonioni] could have gotten done better by any number of American bands. But he chose us â€” very strange.&quot;
