&quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; is the national anthem of Lithuania, also known by its opening words &quot;Lietuva, Tėvynė mūsų&quot; (Lithuania, Our Homeland) and as &quot;Lietuvos himnas&quot; (Hymn of Lithuania). The music and lyrics were written in 1898 by Vincas Kudirka, when Lithuania was still a part of the Russian Empire. The fifty-word poem was a condensation of Kudirka's conceptions of the Lithuanian state, the Lithuanian people, and their past. Shortly after his death in 1899, the anthem was publicly performed for Lithuanians living in Russia. 

The first public Lithuanian performance of the anthem took place in Vilnius in 1905, and it became the official national anthem in 1919, a year after Lithuania declared its independence. In 1950, the Soviet government replaced &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; with their own anthem. The lyrics, written in 1950—and modified after Stalin's death—are about working together with all peoples and how Communism &quot;will light the Earth.&quot; 

&quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; was reinstated as the national anthem in 1992, when the new Constitution was ratified after Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union#Dissolution_of_the_USSR|independence from the Soviet Union. The status of &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; as the state anthem was solidified in 1999 by the passage of a national law.

At the time when the poem ''Lietuva, Tevyne musu'' was written, Lithuania was under the control of the Russian Empire. Kudirka, a medical student at the University of Warsaw, was writing as a columnist for the newspaper ''Varpas'' (The Bell). In his ''Varpas'' columns, Kudirka urged Lithuanians to take pride in their heritage, discussed the problems the Russian Government was causing the Lithuanian population, and denounced those who wished to work for the Russians. In the course of writing for Varpas, he wrote down his thoughts on what Lithuania was and what it should be, resulting in the fifty-word poem called ''Lietuva, Tevyne musu'' (Lithuania, Our Homeland).;[http://members.efn.org/~valdas/kudirka.html Poems by Vincas Kudirka] members.efn.org - Retrieved 22 October 2007 ;

The poem described the heroic past of Lithuania and exhorted its people to care for the land, care for humanity, and live in honor. Kudirka also urged the country to become a source of enlightenment and virtue. Without a melody, Kudirka took the time to compose the music just before dying of tuberculosis. Both the melody and the lyrics were printed in Varpas in September of 1898. Upon his death in 1899, Kudirka's tomb was engraved with the second stanza of the anthem (later destroyed by the authorities).;[http://www.spaudos.lt/Istorija/Vincas_Kudirka.en.htm Vincas Kudirka biography from The Lithuanian Word - Published 1970-1978 as part of the ENCYCLOPEDIA LITUANICA.] spaudos.lt - Retrieved 28 July 2007.;

History

Shortly after Kudirka's death, the first performance of the poem occurred at a concert in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1899. The concert was conducted by Ceslovas Sasnauskas and was attended by Lithuanians, which St. Petersburg had the largest population of at that time. The anthem was first performed in Lithuania during the Great Seimas of Vilnius on December 3, 1905. 

When Lithuania declared its independence from Russia in 1918, the song was declared the national anthem.;[http://neris.mii.lt/prezidentai/aktas1.html Act of Independence of Lithuania (February 16, 1918)] neris.mii.lt - Retrieved 22 October 2007 ; It held this status until Lithuania was annexed into the Soviet Union during World War II.;[http://www2.omnitel.net/ramunas/Lietuva/lt_emblem_anthem.shtml Music and lyrics] omnitel.net - Retrieved 22 October 2007 ; During the interwar period, there had been suggestions to modify the words to include a reference to God. It was decided, in Kudirka's memory, that the lyrics should remain as he had written them.;Encyclopedia Lituanica, &quot;National anthem&quot;, volume IV, pages 24-26;;Antanas Klimas, ''[http://www.lituanus.org/1979/79_4_01.htm Two Lithuanian Encyclopedias completed]'', Lituanus: Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences 25(4), Winter 1979.

During the Soviet era, an alternate anthem was created for the Lithuanian SSR, and instated in 1950. The music was composed by Balys Dvarionas and Jonas Švedas, and the words were written originally by Antanas Venclova. After Joseph Stalin died in 1953, the lyrics were modified by Vacys Reimeris to remove instances of his name. This anthem stated that Lenin had lit the path to freedom, helped by the Russian people, and exhorted the Lithuanian people to work with peoples of the other Soviet Republics. The anthem was confirmed in Article 169 of the 1978 Constitution of the Lithuanian SSR.;; The song continued to be used until Lithuania broke away from the Soviet Union. Starting in 1988, &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; was put forward as the Lithuanian anthem. After preliminary approval by the Lithuanian SSR Supreme Soviet and successive legislative bodies, its status as the national anthem was confirmed in 1992.;[http://www.patogupirkti.lt/BooksExtracts/5430045330.htm Books Extracts] patogupirkti.lt - Retrieved 22 October 2007 ; In that year, the Constitution of Lithuania was approved; Article 19 of the document states that &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; will be the national anthem of Lithuania.;Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania: Chapter 1, Article 19; The last law in relation to the national anthem was passed in 1999; it contained the official lyrics and protocol on how and when to play the anthem.;
