''Unicornography'' is the critically acclaimed;;;; debut album by the Chicago-based punk rock supergroup The Falcon which was released on September 26, 2006 in the United States. The album contains many of the elements found on modern day rock and punk releases, as well as using new musical styles such as blending punk rock with Ska.;;

The guitar on the album was supposed to be played by former Guitarist of Rise Against, Todd Mohney. He was the guitarist on the EP but he could not attend the recording session for Unicornography due to other commitments ;;. Band members Brendan Kelly and drummer Neil Hennessy took over Mohney's role on the album.

Critical reception

The album got favourable reviews from many sites with All Music Guide describing the band as &quot;experts at fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants punk -- it takes skill to make music this great seem so easy to do.&quot; ;;

Punknews.org went as far as saying &quot;Sometimes hype is justified, as the Falcon have clearly proven. Maybe the ultimate &quot;feel-good&quot; album of 2006.&quot; ;; Meanwhile some reviews are a bit more scathing, Aversion.com said &quot;With the departure of Rise Against guitarist Todd Mahoney from the lineup, The Falcon comes off sounding more like The Lawrence Arms' kid brother instead of a stand-alone act&quot;
