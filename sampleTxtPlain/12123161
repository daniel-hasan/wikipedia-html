Blizzard Entertainment's 1998 bestselling real-time strategy game series ''StarCraft'' revolves around interstellar affairs in a distant sector of the galaxy, with three species and multiple factions all vying for supremacy in the sector. The original game has sold over 9.5 million copies;; internationally, making it one of the top selling games in the PC market. One of the reasons for ''StarCrafts success is its intricate story, carried by #Critical reception|generally positively received characters from the industry's reviewers and journalists. The ''StarCraft'' universe, comprising of a number of games, authorized additions and novels, has an extensive list of characters, but only a limited number of these characters have a major influence of the overall story arc.

Most of the main characters in the ''StarCraft'' series are put under the player's control at some point within the game to some degree; #Jim Raynor|Jim Raynor and #Fenix|Fenix are consistently controllable throughout the games, whilst others such as #Edmund Duke|Edmund Duke appear multiple times but are only accessible in-game to the player once or twice. Some characters, such as #Arcturus Mengsk|Arcturus Mengsk and #Aldaris|Aldaris are never put under the control of the player during the course of the games, but feature prominently in the lore of the series. The universe also contains a whole host of minor characters, but these characters are of much lesser significance within isolated areas of the general story.

Casting and design
Image:Over Reverent (StarCraft).jpg|thumb|170px|Extensive concept art was done for the lore of the series.
The characters and story of the ''StarCraft'' series were created by Chris Metzen; and James Phinney.; However, as Phinney was not involved in ''StarCraft: Brood War''; Chris Metzen alone is credited for the development of the plot in the expansion.; Despite the series' success globally, particularly in South Korea, Blizzard Entertainment has not made any major comments regarding the development of the characters and the storyline of the ''StarCraft'' series.

However, interviews with the two of the voice actors have given a glimpse into small parts of the development process. An interview with Robert Clotworthy, the voice of #Jim Raynor|Jim Raynor in all released ''StarCraft'' games to date, has revealed that for the most part the voicing for the characters was done over only a few days in sessions of up to four hours,;; a fact mirrored in a similar interview with #Sarah Kerrigan|Sarah Kerrigan's actress, Glynnis Talken Campbell.;; Clotworthy also stated how the concept art for the game - usually used for the visual development of characters and locales in games - was used by him in order to develop the personality of his character.;

Visually, most of the characters and units in the games were developed from artwork by Metzen and Samwise Didier, although at least two other artists - Glen Rane and Peter Lee - have developed concept art for the upcoming ''StarCraft II''. It is also implied by some of the authors of the novels that the development of the characters in their books was also influenced by Metzen;;;; as well as Andy Chambers and Evelyn Fredericksen.;; This is particularly notable for characters later appearing in the games, such as #Valerian Mengsk|Valerian Mengsk.

Primary characters
=Artanis=
Image:Artanis Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Artanis' in-game portrait from ''Brood War''.

Artanis holds the rank of praetor in the Protoss Defense Forces and at two hundred and sixty two years old; he is the youngest templar to achieve this rank.; An ambitious leader, Artanis holds #Tassadar|Tassadar in high esteem and despite being a strong believer in the Conclave; the young Protoss also holds strongly to the idea of reunification with the dark templar. Initially appearing in ''StarCraft: Brood War|Brood War'', Artanis is voiced by Jack Ritschel; and pilots a scout-class starfighter in-game. In the novel ''StarCraft: Queen of Blades|Queen of Blades'' it is revealed that the executor the player takes the role of in ''StarCraft'';';s Episode III is actually Artanis prior to being made praetor in ''Brood War''.; This was later confirmed in an article released by Blizzard summarising the events of ''StarCraft''.;;

Through Episode IV of ''Brood War'', Artanis works with #Zeratul|Zeratul and #Aldaris|Judicator Aldaris to evacuate the Khalai Protoss to Shakuras and defend the world from the Zerg. During this time they receive unexpected aid from Sarah Kerrigan, but Artanis and Zeratul become furious at Kerrigan's true motives for being on Shakuras and her killing Aldaris.; Despite knowing that destroying the Zerg and its cerebrates on Shakuras will only strengthen her, Artanis and Zeratul activate the Xel'Naga temple on Shakuras,; annihilating the Zerg on the surface. Artanis does not appear again until the end of the game, in which he commands a fleet to bring Kerrigan to justice; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_10 Transcript].; for the Protoss deaths she is responsible for, but his forces meet defeat despite outnumbering Kerrigan's standing forces. Returning to Shakuras and separated from Zeratul, Artanis and the Protoss survivors begin to rebuild their civilization.; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_epi Transcript].; In the ''StarCraft 64'' mission &quot;Resurrection IV&quot;, Artanis enlists the aid of Jim Raynor to de-infest #Alexei Stukov|Alexei Stukov on Braxis,; sterilizing the planet's surface afterwards.;

At Blizzcon in August 2007 it was revealed that Artanis holds the rank of hierarch and thereby is effectively the leader of the reunified Protoss in ''StarCraft II'', but is still struggling with reintegrating the two estranged branches of his people, as many of the Aiur survivors wish to retake their planet while the dark templar do not.;;

=Samir Duran=
Image:Samir Duran Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Samir Duran's in-game portrait from ''Brood War''.

Samir Duran is one of the most mysterious beings in the ''StarCraft'' series. Throughout the game, Duran's character, alliances and motives change from the player's point of view. In a hidden mission, his role and true nature are made even more mysterious. Fan speculations link Duran to nearly every faction and character in the game, but the most common theory is that he is a Xel'Naga. Duran's voice is provided by Paul Ainsley; and he is represented in-game as a Psionic technology (StarCraft)#Ghost agents|ghost agent in both Terran and infested Terran forms, although the two subtly differ.

Duran first appears as a leader of an anti-Dominion resistance force early in ''Brood War'' Episode V,; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_1 Transcript].; and allies with the United Earth Directorate. Although Duran provides invaluable data on the Dominion to the UED, he also allows Zerg to overwhelm their strike forces on Aiur, sabotaging the objectives of that mission and allowing the Dominion emperor to escape.; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_6 Transcript].; As a result, Vice-Admiral #Alexei Stukov|Alexei Stukov suspects him of being a traitor late in Episode V, at which point Duran kills him; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_7 Transcript].; and shows that he is working with #Sarah Kerrigan|Sarah Kerrigan,; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_8 Transcript].; revealing himself as an infested Terran. With Duran as her advisor, Kerrigan successfully establishes herself as the dominant power in the sector, taking command of the majority of the Zerg Swarm in Episode VI. However, despite his valued assistance, Duran vanishes shortly before Kerrigan is attacked in ''Brood Wars final mission. He is discovered by Zeratul in a secret mission on an unknown geological satellite, engineering a Protoss/Zerg hybrid.; At this point Duran states clearly that his work has little to do with Kerrigan, and that he in fact serves what he describes as &quot;a far greater power&quot;.

Due to a lack of appearances in any other media, Duran's true nature is a mystery, and Blizzard Entertainment has not elaborated on his character. What is for certain is that Duran is highly intelligent and manipulative, demonstrating a degree of knowledge of Protoss technology; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_bonus Transcript].; and Zerg control hierarchy,; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_3 Transcript].; along with inside knowledge of several Terran factions. He is able to fool the UED into thinking he is a thirty-three year old; human and Kerrigan into thinking he is infested when he is neither, although the means by which he accomplishes this are not known. Duran also claims to have &quot;had many names throughout the millennia&quot;, displaying that he is far older than any other character in ''StarCraft''; even the extremely long lived Protoss rarely live over a single millennium.

Furious, Mengsk calls in favors to what he describes as &quot;special interest groups&quot;,; forming a new fleet and attacking Kerrigan's orbital base at Char. Despite a desperate alliance with the UED and the Protoss, the fleet is defeated and Mengsk retreats back to Korhal to rebuild the Dominion, letting Kerrigan know that he will be there when she finally &quot;slips up&quot;.; In novels set after ''StarCraft'', Mengsk still rules the Dominion and it is still the dominant Terran power in the Koprulu Sector.

November Annabella Terra,;; normally known by her codename Nova, is a ghost agent for the Terran Dominion, and the protagonist of the ''StarCraft: Ghost'' sub-series.

=The Overmind=
Image:Overmind Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|The Overmind's in-game portrait from ''StarCraft''.

The Overmind is the original leader of the Zerg Swarm and the center of their hive-mind society.; According to the contextual history of the game, the Xel'Naga wanted to make sure the Zerg did not suffer from problems arising from individual egos like the Protoss had, and so created the Overmind to act as a single consciousness. However, the Overmind grows at an exponential rate, becoming sentient and aware of its masters.; After luring a space-faring race to the Zerg homeworld Zerus and assimilating them, the Overmind attacks the Xel'Naga fleet and assimilates many of them; and learns of their experiments on the Protoss.

The Zerg travel from planet to planet, assimilating creatures and becoming stronger, but the Overmind desires the assimilation of the Protoss above all else, believing that such an action will result in perfection for the Zerg.; During the first half of ''StarCraft'', the Zerg and Protoss clash on various Terran worlds until the dark templar #Zeratul|Zeratul kills the cerebrate List of minor characters in the StarCraft universe#Zasz|Zasz. This temporarily links the minds of the Overmind and Zeratul, allowing each to learn critical information about the other, with Zeratul learning of the Xel'Naga's hand in the Zerg's evolution; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e3_9 Transcript].; while giving the Overmind the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur.; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e2_8 Transcript].; The Overmind quickly launches an invasion of Aiur, stealing Protoss technology and using it to manifest itself on the planet's surface.; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e2_10 Transcript].; After a lengthy war with heavy casualties, Zeratul and the high templar #Tassadar|Tassadar return and with the help of #Jim Raynor|Jim Raynor, Tassadar is able to sacrifice himself to destroy the Overmind.;

A major plot point in ''Brood War'' is the formation of a second Overmind from the union of several cerebrates.; However, this incarnation of the Overmind never reaches full maturity. It is not sapient, does not have the same powers or intelligence as the original and has much weaker defenses;; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e4_6 Transcript].; attacks that were superficial to the first Overmind send the second into remission, although it still takes dark templar energy to be killed.; The United Earth Directorate enslaves the organism and uses it to control a majority of the Zerg,; but it is eventually killed by Zeratul.; Although this Overmind is the same type of bioform as the original, it is not the same character. The character of the Overmind is voiced by Jack Ritschel; in ''StarCraft'';.

=Raszagal=

However, whilst the player's character, along with #Zeratul|Zeratul and #Artanis|Artanis are recovering the crystals necessary to activate the temple during the course of Episode IV, the judicator #Aldaris|Aldaris learns that #Sarah Kerrigan|Kerrigan is holding mental sway over the matriarch and starts an open revolt against the dark templar on Shakuras. Upon Artanis' and Zeratul's return to the planet late in Episode IV, Raszagal orders the termination of Aldaris.; Aldaris is eventually killed by Sarah_Kerrigan|Kerrigan, and despite Zeratul's growing suspicions of Raszagal,; the temple is activated in the final mission of Episode IV, annihilating the Zerg on the surface.; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e4_8 Transcript].;

The matriarch does not feature in the game again until the late stages of Episode VI, when Kerrigan and #Samir Duran|Duran abduct her from a fortified outpost on Shakuras.; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_7 Transcript].; Kerrigan then uses Raszagal to persuade Zeratul to assassinate the second Zerg Overmind,; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_8 Transcript].; after which it is revealed that Raszagal had been controlled by Kerrigan since before the events of Episode IV; and that Raszagal was following Kerrigan's objectives for dominance. However, Zeratul's forces recapture Raszagal, but are unable to hold off the Zerg forces long enough to escape. Realising that Raszagal is beyond redemption from Kerrigan's influence, Zeratul kills Raszagal.; [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_9 Transcript].; Razagal's mind is freed by the lethal blow, and she dies thanking Zeratul for releasing her, naming him as her successor as leader of the dark templar.

Raszagal makes a brief appearance in the novel ''Shadow Hunters'' as the first dark templar to be captured and questioned by Adun in his mission to exterminate the dissident Protoss, and it is ultimately her testimony that convinces the high templar to spare the dark templar.;

Minor characters

In addition to the main characters, the ''StarCraft'' series also has a significant roster of supporting characters. These characters are usually main characters in their prospective source - for example, List of minor characters in the StarCraft universe#Michael Liberty|Michael Liberty is the central character to ''StarCraft: Liberty's Crusade'' and List of minor characters in the StarCraft universe#Jack Frost|Jack Frost is a key character in ''Insurrection'' - but do not have any major influence on the overall storyline outside these mediums. Whilst their contributions are noteworthy in expanding the universe, they can be regarded as minor characters within the entirety of the ''StarCraft'' series.
