This page lists all the winners of the Eurovision Song Contest, an annual competition organised by member countries of the European Broadcasting Union. The Contest, which has been broadcast every year since its debut in 1956, is one of the longest-running television programmes in the world. The Contest's winner has been determined using numerous voting techniques throughout its history; centre to these have been the awarding of points to countries by juries or televoters. The country awarded the most points is declared the winner.;;[http://www.eurovision.tv/addons/files/Extract_ESC2007Rules.pdf Extract from the rules for the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest]. Eurovision.tv. Retrieved on 22 August 2007.;;

The Contest has produced fifty-five winners in fifty-two Contests: one every year except the tied 1969 Contest, which had four winners. Twenty-four different countries have won the Contest; the most recent addition to this list is Serbia, which won the Contest on its debut appearance in 2007.;;Serbia were participating for the first time as an independent nation, previously they had competed as part of Serbia and Montenegro and Yugoslavia. Switzerland also won the Contest on their debut—the first Contest, in 1956.;; The country with the highest number of wins is Ireland, with seven. Portugal is the country with the longest history in the Contest without a win; it made its fortieth appearance at the 2007 Contest.

Eleven Eurovision winners featured at the ''Congratulations'' concert in 2005, in which ABBA's &quot;Waterloo&quot; was voted the most popular song of the Contest's first fifty years.;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4366574.stm ABBA win 'Eurovision 50th' vote]. BBC News (23 October 2005). Retrieved on 22 August2007.; The most successful countries never to have won the Contest are Malta and Russia, having both finished second twice and third twice. The highest number of points scored by a winning country at Eurovision was the 292 points achieved by Finland's Lordi at the 2006 Contest. The lowest total is the eighteen points scored by the four winning countries in 1969. The largest margin of victory was that of Katrina and The Waves in 1997, who won by 70 points.

The United Kingdom has finished second fifteen times at Eurovision, more than any other country. Since the introduction of the current voting system in 1975, the winner of the Contest has been decided by the final voting nation on eleven occasions.;1979, 1980, 1981, 1984, 1988, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1998, 2002 and 2003.;

By language
Between 1966 and 1973, and again between 1977 and 1998, countries were only permitted to perform in their own language; see the main Eurovision Song Contest#Language|Eurovision Song Contest article.

Marija Šerifović's &quot;Molitva&quot; became the first Serbian-language song to win the Contest, and the first winner since 1989 to be in a language that had never produced a winning song before.
