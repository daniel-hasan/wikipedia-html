A chiton was a piece of clothing in the Ancient Greek world. It was made of two sheets of light drapery and worn directly over the body. A belt, usually under the breast (&quot;high-girded&quot;) or around the waist (&quot;low-girded&quot;) helped contain it. Double-girded were also fashionable. The chiton was often worn in combination with the heavier himation, which had the role of a cloak.

It was the outfit of Aphrodite because it was considered very feminine. Men also wore it. Dionysus is often drawn wearing it. Poets and male artists also wore it.

When used alone (without a himation), the chiton was called ''monochiton''.

A long chiton, reaching heels was called ''chiton poderes'', and even longer, dragging by the ground was called ''chiton syrtos''.

A large belt, called the ''zoster'' could be worn over the chiton.

The chiton was also worn by the Romans.

Name
The Greek word &quot;khitōn&quot; can be traced to the Central Semitic word &quot;*kittan&quot;, which is from the Akkadian words &quot;kitû&quot; or &quot;kita’um&quot;, meaning flax or linen, and originally the Sumerian word &quot;gada&quot; or &quot;gida&quot;.;[http://bartelby.com/61/7/C0310700.html American Heritage dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.2000. entry for chiton];
