, also known as ''Ken, the Great Bear Fist'', is a Japanese manga series that was originally serialized from 1983 to 1988 in the Japanese magazine ''Weekly Shonen Jump'', created by Tetsuo Hara and Buronson. The manga spans 245 chapters that were originally reprinted in 27 collected volumes (tankōbon) under the ''Jump Comics'' imprint.

Set in a Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post apocalyptic world where the Earth is barren and the strong survive by preying on the weak, the series follows the journey of Kenshiro, the successor of ''Hokuto Shinken'' (北斗神拳, &quot;Divine Fist of the North Star&quot;),;While the name Hokuto Shinken literally means ''Big Dipper God Fist'', the standard translation for the fighting style is the same as its English title, ''Fist of the North Star''. It is also referred as the ''Sacred Martial Arts of the Great Bear'' in Viz Media edition and as ''God Fist of the North Star'' in the Gutsoon! edition.; a secret martial arts style that allows its practitioner to destroy an opponent's body from within by striking into their secret channeling points, often resulting in a violent and gruesome death. Kenshiro uses his skills to protect the weak and innocent against the numerous villains that threaten their survival.

''Fist of the North Star'' was one of the ''Weekly Shonen Jump's'' most popular titles during the 1980's. As of 2007, it is the seventh best-selling ''Shonen Jump'' manga of all time in Japan.;; In a poll conducted by TV Asahi in 2005, the ''Fist of the North Star'' anime series ranked 25 in a list of Top 100 Anime series.;; In a second poll in 2006, it ranked No. 89.;; In a celebrity version of the poll, it ranked No. 15.

The title ''Fist of the North Star'' is somewhat of a mistranslation of the Japanese original, as ''Hokuto'' refers not to the North Star Polaris, but to the Big Dipper asterism, which is known in Japan as ''Hokuto Shichisei'' (北斗七星, literally &quot;Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper&quot;). In Japan, the actual North Star is known as ''Hokkyokusei'' (北極星, &quot;North Pole Star&quot;) or ''Tenteisei'' (天帝星, &quot;Imperial Star&quot;). In official English localization of the series, the term ''Hokuto'' is usually translated as &quot;North Star&quot; in an effort to maintain consistency with the title.

Publication history
=Pilot version=
The original One-shot (comics)|one shot prototype of ''Hokuto no Ken'', published in the April 1983 edition of ''Fresh Jump'', was set in present-day Japan and told the story of a teenager by the name of , the successor of the &quot;''Hokuto Shinken''&quot; martial arts style, a deadly style which kills or cripples opponents internally by striking pressure points. Kenshiro's main adversaries in this incarnation of the story were a rival martial arts school known as the , a secret organization of assassins with influence over the Japanese government. Kenshiro's girlfriend, Yuki, becomes a witness in one of the organization's hits and is subsequently killed by the culprit, with Kenshiro being framed for the crime. This event serves as a catalyst for Kenshiro's war against the Taizanji organization.
A second one-shot, titled ''Hokuto no Ken II'', was published in the June 1983 issue of ''Fresh Jump''. Both pilots were collected in the second collected volume of ''Tetsu no Don Quixote'' (Tetsuo Hara's prior manga series before ''Hokuto no Ken'').

Tetsuo Hara has stated that he came up with the idea of ''Hokuto no Ken'' from his editor Nobuhiko Horie. According to Hara, Horie suggested to him that he should draw a manga about &quot;a martial artist who destroys his opponents by striking their acupressure points&quot; based on Hara's wishes to draw a martial arts manga and his knowledge of pressure points.;;

=Serialization=
''Weekly Shonen Jump'', Issue #41 from 1983, featuring the debut of the ''Hokuto no Ken'' series.
The two ''Hokuto no Ken'' one-shots were well-received in ''Fresh Jumps reader's survey and when Tetsuo Hara was commissioned to turn ''Hokuto no Ken'' into a weekly series, the task was reportedly too much for Hara to handle alone and manga writer Yoshiyuki Okamura (who worked on the series under the pen name of Buronson) was assigned to work with him. The storyline was completely revamped, with the present-day setting being discarded in favor of a ''Mad Max''-inspired post apocalyptic future. The Taizanji Kenpo school were no longer the main antagonists and Kenshiro, originally a teenager, was now an adult with seven scars on his chest whose design was partly inspired by Bruce Lee.;;

Originally, Tetsuo Hara was contracted to do ''Fist of the North Star'' for a three-year run, but due to its popularity and the publisher's demand, it was extended to a five-year run.; ;

=Sequels and spinoffs=
After the manga ended its run, Tetsuo Hara and Buronson wrote a novel based on the manga titled , published by Jump Books in Japan in 1996. It was adapted into a three-part OVA series titledin 2003. The story is set sometime after the conclusion of the manga.

In 2001, Tetsuo Hara began working on a ''Fist of the North Star'' prequel titled , which is currently serialized in''Weekly Comic Bunch''. Set during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1935, the story stars Hokuto Shinken predecessor and Kenshiro's namesake, Kenshiro Kasumi.

Following the theatrical release of the movie ''Raō Den Jun'ai no Sho'' in 2006, numerous ''Fist of the North Star'' spinoffs began to be published in the ''Weekly Comic Bunch'' and ''Big Comics Superior''. This lineup of titles has been dubbed theseries, as each title focuses on a major character from the franchise. The following titles had been published so far:

*by Youkow Osada. - A series that was serialized in ''Weekly Comics Bunch'' featuring Reina and Souga from the ''Raoh Den'' movie. All 42 chapters (as well as a two-part epilogue published sometime after the series' conclusion) were collected in five tankobon volumes.;;

*by Akimi Kasai. Serialized at ''Big Comics Superior'' in three parts that ran from March 10 to April 14, 2006 and six subsequent chapters from March 9 to June 8, 2007. A single tankobon volume was released.;;

Plot overview
The prologue of ''Fist of the North Star'' informs us that the world was engaged in a global nuclear war in the year 199X. After the war, the earth's surface became devoid of vegetation, the seas evaporated and civilization was thrown into chaos, turning everyday life into a battle for supplies of uncontaminated food and water, where the strong survive by preying on the weak. However, one man vows to make a difference. Kenshiro is the successor of the art of Hokuto Shinken, a deadly 1,800 year-old assassination style that is only passed down from one master to a chosen son. Kenshiro uses his skills and knowledge to protect the innocent from the bloodthirsty gangs that threaten their survival. Throughout the course of the series, Kenshiro meets several allies and rivals, most of whom are also trained in various martial arts styles.

The first chapter serves to introduce Kenshiro and depicts his initial meeting with his two sidekicks, Bat and Lin. The initial story arc then centers Kenshiro's quest to reclaim his fiancee Yuria, who was taken from him by his former friend Shin, a master of the rivalstyle.;Like Hokuto, the term Nanto is usually localized in English translations as &quot;South Star&quot; (or &quot;Southern Cross&quot; in the Viz edition, the name of Shin's city). Nanto actually refers to the South Dipper, a Chinese asterism that forms part of Sagittarius. The ''Fighting Mania'' arcade game actually alternates between &quot;South Star&quot; and the literal &quot;South Dipper&quot; in translations. The asterism has no relation to the Southern Cross.;After the Shin arc, the manga began focusing around one-off arc-based villains such as the Golan, Jackal and the Fang Clan, although the story gradually shifts to Ken's search for his three adopted brothers, who were trained in the Hokuto Shinken style under the same master but were not chosen to be successors. The eldest of the brothers, Raoh, becomes the primary antagonist and Ken's primary nemesis at this point, a conqueror who uses Hokuto Shinken to rule with tyranny. A major sub-plot is also introduced in the form of an internal conflict within the Nanto school between its six grand masters, the , and the Hokuto brothers' involvement in it.

The death of Raoh marks the end of the first era of the series and the setting jumps several years, with Ken's sidekicks Bat and Lin having reached adulthood. Kenshiro returns to help Bat and Lin overthrow the evil Jakoh, a corrupt Governor General that has usurped the throne of the Heavenly Empress and is coercing themasters to do his evil bidding. After Jakoh's defeat, Lin is kidnapped and taken overseas to the , a war-torn nation now ruled by the three . The origins of the Hokuto brothers and the Hokuto Shinken style are revealed, as well as the existence of the forbiddenstyle, a branch of the originalformed alongside with Hokuto Shinken. 

After Kaioh's defeat, Raoh's son Ryu is introduced as Kenshiro's apprentice and possible successor to the Hokuto Shinken style. The final chapters centers around Kenshiro's adventures with the young Ryu and explores the relationship between Ken, Lin and Bat.

=Characters=

''Fist of the North Star'' has a large ensemble of characters that has changed constantly during the series' original five-year run. Among the inhabitants of the post-apocalyptic world of ''Fist of the North Star'' includes martial artists, royal families, rebels, bandits and villagers that are merely attempting to survive a cruel, harsh world. 

Although protagonist Kenshiro is the only truly permanent character from the series' inception up until the final chapter, his two sidekicks, Bat and Lin have serve as series' mainstays as well, introduced as a pair of orphaned children whom Kenshiro meets during the first chapter of the series and then growing up into rebel leaders and heroes in their own right. 

Kenshiro encounters several rivals and allies throughout the course of the series, many of whom are affiliated with the martial arts schools featured in the series (see fighting styles section). The series initially focuses on two rival factions, the Hokuto Shinken school and the Nanto Seiken school. Characters in Fist of the North Star#Shin|Shin, a representative of Nanto Seiken, serves as Kenshiro's first major nemesis, being the man responsible for engraving the seven stab wounds on Kenshiro's chest and kidnapping his fiancee Characters in Fist of the North Star#Yuria|Yuria. After Shin's death, the authors would expand the storyline by introducing other Hokuto and Nanto disciples, namely the Nanto Roku Seiken and the four Hokuto brothers. A major recurring antagonist is introduced in the form of Raoh, the eldest of the four Hokuto brothers, who would become the series' most prominent villain.

After Raoh's death, the Characters in Fist of the North Star#Gento Koken|Gento Kōken fighters and their leader Falco would serve as reluctant adversaries of Kenshiro. Another group of antagonists are introduced with the fighters from the Land of Asura. Their ruler of Asura, Characters in Fist of the North Star#Hokuto Ryuken|Kaioh of the Hokuto Ryuken school, is the last major nemesis Kenshiro confronts in the series, although other villains appear after him in the manga.

Many of the characters in the series have since become stars of their own spinoff manga (see later works section).

= Fighting styles=

The primary fighting style depicted in ''Fist of the North Star'' is ''Hokuto Shinken'', the style used by Kenshiro and his three adopted brothers. ''Hokuto Shinken'' relies primarily on 708 secret accupressure points on the human's body that forms part of a fictional system known as the . By pushing into one of the ''hikō'' points, one can cause destruction into the enemy's body from within or even control their body against their own will. There are also beneficial ''hikō'' points that can be used to cure sickness or heal wounds, including restore a mute person's voice or a blind person's sight. In addition, the masters of ''Hokuto Shinken'' can tap into their body's full potential strength, whereas an average person only uses 30% of their strength.

The main rival style of ''Hokuto Shinken'' in the beginning of the series is ''Nanto Seiken'', a style which is described as the polar opposite of ''Hokuto Shinken''. In contrast to the ''Hokuto'' style, which uses the ''hikō'' points to cause destruction from within, the ''Nanto'' style specializes in stabbing and slicing techniques that penetrate the body from the outside and destroy everything in its path. Originally the style is used by Shin, the first major antagonist, but throughout the course of the series the existence of other branches of the ''Nanto Seiken'' are revealed, the six top branches being the ''Nanto Roku Seiken''.

Two other major styles are introduced during the latter half of the series; ''Gento Kōken'', a style which specializes inki-based projectile attacks that destroy the enemy on a cellular level; and ''Hokuto Ryūken'', a brother style of ''Hokuto Shinken'' which causes destruction through an opponent'sand teaches its users to summon their .

=English editions=
''Fist of the North Star: Master Edition Vol. 9'', published by Gutsoon.
Two different companies attempted to translate the original ''Fist of the North Star'' manga for the English market, although both attempts failed to finish their run. VIZ Communications originally published the first sixteen chapters in eight monthly squarebound comic book issues (two/three chapters per issue) in 1989. Viz resumed publication of the series from 1995 to 1997, publishing the subsequent 28 chapters of the series in 18 monthly pamphlet-sized issues (each issue containing roughly one chapter and a half) divided into three &quot;parts&quot;. Four graphic novel collections were published by Viz: ''Fist of the North Star'', ''Night of the Jackal'', ''Southern Cross'' and ''Blood Brothers''. The Viz edition featured mirrored artwork, as was the standard with English translated manga at the time.

In 2003, Gutsoon! Entertainment began publishing a ''Master Edition'' of the series, large squarebound graphic novel installments (eight/nine chapters per volume) that were printed in high quality paper. In addition to sporting a revised translation and retaining the original right-to-left orientation, the ''Master Edition'' of the series also featured new Computer-generated imagery|CG coloring added to the original artwork. Gutsoon ceased publication of the series with Vol. 9 due to the company folding. The license has yet to be picked up by another company.

Adaptations
=TV series=

TV's ''Hokuto no Ken'' title card.
''Hokuto no Ken 2'' title card.
''Hokuto no Ken'' was first adaptated into a weekly anime series by Toei Animation. The series aired on Fuji Television from October 4, 1984 to March 5, 1987 and was given the subtitle offollowing episode 22.;; It was immediately followed by a sequel series, titled ''Hokuto no Ken 2'', which aired from March 13, 1987 to February 18, 1988. A combined total of 152 episodes were produced for the two series. Reruns are aired in Japan on the satellite television network Animax.

The violent content of the TV series is toned down considerably compared to the original manga, with much of the gore being discolored via desaturation. Like many manga-based anime series, filler material was added to prevent the series from getting ahead of its source material. 

The ''Hokuto no Ken'' portion of the series spans four major story arcs that follows the manga's plotline from the beginning and up until chapter 136 (prior to the timeskip). Each story arc (or chapters, as they referred within the show) spans a certain number of episodes each adapting a portion of the original manga. The first chapter is based on chapters 1-25 of the original manga, but changes the order of events so that Ken's battle with Shin is left for last, turning all the other villains into his subordinates. The rest of the series follows the manga's plotline more closely. The ''Hokuto no Ken 2'' portion takes place after the timeskip and adapts the storyline of the Celestial Emperor and Asura arcs of the manga. The post-Asura chapters were not adapted for the series.

The entire series has been collected on DVD in Japan, in a boxed collection known as the ''Super Premium Box'';; and in 26 individually released discs containing 5-6 episodes per volume.;; A three volume DVD series, the ''Kyūkyoku Retsuden'' series, contains highlight episodes of the show.;; Prior to the DVD release of the series, Toei released three hour-long compilation episodes on VHS composed of re-edited footage from the series. Toei is currently planning an High-definition video|HD Remaster Edition of the ''Hokuto no Ken'' DVD Box Set in commemoration of the franchise's 25th anniversary. In addition to containing all 152 episodes on 26 discs, the set will also contain two additional discs of bonus content: the first bonus disc will contain all three episodes of the ''Hokuto no Ken'' Digest Edition previously released only on VHS. The second bonus disc will contain credit-less opening and closing animation, the original preview ad for the series, the first episode of ''Hokuto no Ken'' dubbed in Beijing dialect and interviews with the staff and cast of the show. The set will also come packaged with a deluxe booklet and a reproduction of a promotional ''Hokuto no Ken'' poster issued prior to the show's first airing. A Limited Edition version of the box set will also come packaged with a Kenshiro and Kokuoh figure by Kaiyodo. The box set is currently scheduled for a March 28, 2008 release. ;;

The first 36 episodes were licensed to Manga Entertainment and released in English dubbed and subtitled formats on VHS and DVD. Manga Entertainment initially the released the series in eight VHS volumes spanning only 24 episodes in 1999 and later released all 36 episodes in five DVD volumes in 2003.;; The English dub of the show features a new soundtrack provided by Reinforced Records and voice acting by Animaze. The original opening and ending sequences were replaced by in-house versions produced by Manga Entertainment with music by Mike Egan. The dubbed version aired on Showtime Beyond in the US and on the Sci-Fi Channel in the UK.

Manga Entertainment's treatment of the series has been criticized by reviewers, particularly at their decision to replace the original Japanese soundtrack with their own music for the English dub. A reviewer of DVD Vision Japan stated that the English voice acting was &quot;terrible, even for an early dub&quot; and compared David Lucas' performance as Shin unfavorably to his role as Spike Spiegel in ''Cowboy Bebop''. The same reviewer also states that the music by Mike Egan is mediocre.;; Mike Toole of Anime Jump proclaimed that the drum n' bass soundtrack is &quot;occasionally nice, but usually just obtrusive&quot;.;; Chadwick Ngan of EX Anime wrote that the &quot;American voice actors' efforts are commendable&quot; and that the new opening and ending themes &quot;aren't bad, but nothing to get excited about either.&quot;;;

=1986 animated movie=
A promotional illustration of the ''Fist of the North Star'' animated movie.
An animated feature film version of ''Fist of the North Star'' was produced by Toei Animation, which premiered in Japan on March 8, 1986. The movie was intended to be a big-screen treatment of the manga, and avoid the watering-down of violence that came with the TV series. An English-dubbed version produced by Streamline Pictures was first released in 1991.

In a notable deviation from the series, the film finds time to begin with a detailed peek at the Earth as it was before and during the fabled nuclear devastation. Starting with a calm, surreal look at various points of mother nature, a brief on-screen message then informs the audience of the imminent calamity, followed by unsettling scenes of human life consumed in flame.

The film follows the TV series and manga from Kenshiro's defeat at the hands of Shin to the first battle with Raoh, although certain liberties were taken to tell the story in a condensed form. Toki, the second of the four Hokuto Brothers, is never seen or mentioned, while Shin and Rei are the only Nanto Seiken masters to appear in the film. While Yuria's Nanto heritage is mentioned thorought the movie in the Japanese version, her role as the Last Nanto General is downplayed. Mamiya, Rei's love interest, is never seen, partly because Yuria is the heroine in her place. Raoh serves as the main antagonist, with Jagi and Shin as the other two major villains. Many other villains from the manga such as the Colonel and Jackal only make cameo appearances as minor henchmen with some of the notable fight scenes involving Zeed, Heart, the Fang King and Uighur.

There were two endings produced for the film. The original theatrical ending in Japan showed Raoh emerging victorious over Kenshiro, but sparing his life, leaving him to protect Lin. An alternate ending was produced that shows the fight ending in a draw, which was the ending featured in the VHS and Laserdisc release of the film in Japan. The English dub version by Streamline Pictures is based on the theatrical version and thus features the original ending. Many Western fans believe that the &quot;draw ending&quot; was the original ending, but this is a common misconception due to the fact that the original ending where Raoh wins is not featured in any of the official home video releases in Japan.

The English dub version of the movie was not only first animated incarnation of ''Fist of the North Star'' to be released in English, it was also one of the earliest anime films distributed in North America and has had mixed reviews among casual viewers and anime fandom. A review from Akemi's Anime World calls it &quot;so bad it's good, and the original in the genre&quot; and calls quality of the dub &quot;cheesy&quot;, but &quot;suitable&quot;.;; Richard Harrington of the Washington Post criticized the violent nature of the movie and quality of the animation, saying that &quot;watching it you'll feel as comfortable as a hemophiliac in a razor blade factory&quot;.;; Stephen Nolden of the New York Times expresses that &quot;in its carelessly translated and poorly dubbed English adaptation, the characters express themselves in diction so stiff that they seem ludicrously prissy&quot;.;;

=1995 live-action movie=
An American-produced live-action movie version of ''Fist of the North Star'' was released in 1995, directed by Tony Randel based on a script by Peter Atkins and Wynne McLaughlin. The movie, loosely based on the Shin storyline of the manga, stars Gary Daniels as Kenshiro, Costas Mandylor as Shin and Japanese actress Isako Washio as Yuria, with Malcom McDowell as Ryuken and Chris Penn as &quot;Jackal&quot; (actually a renamed Jagi). The movie saw a theatrical release in Japan, but went direct-to-video|straight-to-video in the US. The Japanese dubbed version used the original voice actors from the 1980s anime series.

The movie had mixed reviews from fans and critics. Dave Foster of ''DVD Times'' panned the movie as a poor adaptation and commented that Kenshiro's pressure point techniques &quot;''look rather tame''&quot; in comparison to the way depicted in the manga and anime series.;
; A reviewer from eFilmCritic remarked that Kenshiro's defeat at the hands of Shin &quot;''comes off as standard''&quot; and &quot;''unbelievably goofy''&quot; compared to the 1986 animated movie version. However, Video World gave a much more positive review, calling it &quot;First rate&quot;, and an Amazon.com reviewer commented that &quot;Bruce Lee would have loved this movie.&quot;;;

=''New Fist of the North Star''=
 is a three-part OVA series produced by Toei Animation that was originally released in 2003 and 2004 in Japan. It is based on an original ''Hokuto no Ken'' novel by Buronson and Hara , whom the first episode of the trilogy draws its title from. It was fully licensed and released in English by ADV Films. Akira Kamiya, who had voiced Kenshiro in all previous animated incarnations, was replaced by Takehito Koyasu for this new OVA series. Celebrity voices were also employed, with musician Gackt (who also performs the opening and ending themes of the OVA) as the antagonist Seiji. It was the last animated incarnation of ''Hokuto no Ken'' produced by Toei.

Set sometime after the conclusion of ''Hokuto no Ken 2'' and the original manga, a man named Sanga has constructed a fortified zone called The Last Land. While Sanga's men go out and seek water through violent means, they encounter Kenshiro who desires to end their reign of terror.

The ADV Films' dub of the trilogy has garnered positive reviews from critics. Chris Wood of Toon Zone praised &quot;Kenshiro is in fine form, and though the story may not blow you away, it’s plenty adequate to support the action&quot;;; Mike Toole of Anime Jump says that ''New Fist'' is &quot;flashy and a little cheap, but ultimately rewarding.&quot;;; Chris Beveridge of AnimeOnDVD.com was &quot;very pleased with&quot; the first episode,;; but felt that the second episode could've been &quot;much better written&quot;;; and that the third episode was unnecessary and that the trilogy &quot;could have been a lot tighter with a bit more streamlining of the script&quot;.;;
