Nailatikau's outspoken calls to tackle the AIDS crisis have attracted controversy.On 22 November 2005, he called on people to recognize the reality that promiscuity existed, and that safe sex needed to be promoted to combat the associated AIDS risk.It was unrealistic to deny promiscuity and just promote abstinence, he considered, adding that this was a matter of life and death.He also called on churches to face the reality that promiscuity existed among their own congregations, and to meet the problem &quot;head on&quot; and play a part in promoting the use of condoms.
