The Blue iguana or Grand Cayman iguana (''Cyclura lewisi'') is a critically endangered species of lizard of the genus ''Cyclura'' endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. Previously listed as ''Cyclura nubila lewisi'' as a subspecies of Cuban Iguana, it has been since reclassified as its own species due to genetic differences discovered in 2000. The Blue iguana has been noted as one of the longest-living species of lizard (possibly 69 years) and is a National Symbol of the Cayman Islands.

By the year 2003, fewer than 15 of these animals still lived in the wild, and this wild population was expected to be extinct within the first decade of the 21st century. The animals' demise is mainly being driven by predation by feral human pets (cats and dogs) and indirectly by the destruction of their natural habitat as fruit farms are converted to pasture for cattle grazing.

Since 2004, 219 captive-bred iguanas have been released into a preserve on Grand Cayman run by a partnership headed by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in an attempt to save this critically endangered species. Some success with naturally laid eggs has been reported in the wild. At least five non-profit organizations are working with the government of the Cayman Islands to ensure the survival of this species.

Taxonomy
The Grand Cayman Blue iguana, ''Cyclura lewisi'', is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman.; Its generic name ''Cyclura'', is derived from the Greek words ''cyclos'' meaning &quot;circular&quot; and ''urus'' meaning &quot;tail&quot;, after the thick ringed tail characteristic of all ''Cyclura'' iguanas.;

; Its specific name is a Latinized form of the name of the scientist who first described this species, Bernard C. Lewis.;

The Blue iguana's closest relatives are ''C. nubila nubila'' on Cuba and ''C. cychlura cychlura'' in the Bahamas, all having apparently diverged from a common ancestor some three million years ago.;; The species has a low genetic diversity but does not seem to suffer the same lack of vitality that afflicts other such species of rock iguana.;; One theory is that the species evolved from a single female Cuban rock iguana (''C. nubila nubila'') with eggs inside her who drifted across the sea, perhaps during a storm.;; It is distinct from the subspecies found on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac known as ''C. nubila caymanensis'', although it can breed with this subspecies and produce fertile offspring.;

;;

In 1938, Bernard C. Lewis of the Institute of Jamaica joined an Oxford University biological expedition to the Cayman Islands.; Lewis was able to obtain two blue iguanas, a male and a female, which were later lodged with the British Museum of Natural History.; Chapman Grant, in a monograph published in 1940, formally described the blue iguana for the first time as ''Cyclura macleayi lewisi''.;;;;

;

In 1977, Schwartz and Carey established the trinomial ''Cyclura nubila lewisi'' for the blue iguana.;;They held that the Grand Cayman blue iguana was a strongly distinct subspecies of ''C. nubila'', commonly known as the Cuban rock iguana, the species from which it evolved and with which it can breed. They emphasized its overall bright blue coloration, noting that further study may reveal this lizard to be a distinct species.;; The current taxonomic change was made in 2004 by Frederic Burton, who named the blue iguana a distinct species in its own right.; This decision was made after years of research comparing scale counts on the heads of other Caribbean iguanas, including those found on Little Cayman, Cayman Brac, Cuba, and the Bahamas, with those of the blue iguana, as well as mitochondrial DNA analysis performed by Dr. Catherine Malone, to re-examine the phylogeography of the different species.;

Anatomy and morphology
The Blue iguana is a large species of rock iguana with a body length of 20 to 30 inches (51–76cm) and an equally long tail.; It is the largest native land animal on Grand Cayman with a total nose-to-tail length of five feet (1.5m) and weighing as much as 30 pounds (13.6kg).;;

;The Blue iguana's toes are articulated to be efficient in digging and climbing trees.; The Blue iguana has been observed climbing in trees 15 feet (4.6m) and higher.;

Male Blue iguanas are larger than females.; The mature male's skin color ranges from dark grey to turquoise blue, whereas the female is more olive green to pale blue.; Young animals tend to be uniformly dark brown or green with faint darker banding.; When they first emerge from the nest the neonates have an intricate pattern of eight dark dorsal chevrons from the crest of their necks to their pelvic area.; These markingds fade by the time the animal is one year old changing to mottled gray and cream and eventually giving way to blue as adults.;

;As adults, the Blue iguana is typically dark gray in color matching the karst rock of its landscape.;The animal changes its color to blue when its in the presence of other iguanas to signal and establish territory.;

The Blue iguana's eyes have a golden iris and red sclera, and their distinctive black feet stand in contrast to their lighter overall body color.; Male Blue iguanas have femoral pores, which are used to release pheromones.; Females lack these pores and do not have a dorsal crest as high as the male's, making the animal somewhat sexually dimorphic.;

;;

;

Blue iguanas have excellent vision, which allows them to detect shapes and motions at long distances.;

;As Blue iguanas have only a few Rod cells they have poor vision in low-light conditions. At the same time they have cells called “double cones” which give them sharp color vision and enable them to see ultraviolet wavelenghts.;This ability is highly useful when basking so the animal can ensure that it absorbs enough sunlight in the forms of UVA and UVB to produce Vitamin D.;

Blue iguanas have evolved a white photosensory organ on the top of their heads called the parietal eye, which are also called third eye, pineal eye or pineal gland.;This “eye” doesn’t work the same way as a normal eye does as it has only a rudimentary retina and lens and thus, cannot form images.;It is however sensitive to changes in light and dark and can detect movement.;

Primarily herbivorous, Blue iguanas are presented with a special problem for osmoregulation: plant matter contains more potassium and as it has less nutritional content per gram, more must be eaten to meet the lizard's metabolic needs.;

;As Blue iguanas are not capable of creating liquid urine more concentrated than their bodily fluids, like birds they excrete nitrogenous wastes as urate salts through a salt gland.;As a result, Blue iguanas have developed this lateral nasal gland to supplement renal salt secretion by expelling excess potassium and sodium chloride.;

Habitat and distribution
Image:Cayman Islands (detail).jpg|thumb|300px|Cayman Islands
The Blue iguana is found only on the island of Grand Cayman. Comparison with other ''Cyclura'' species in the region strongly suggests that there was once a coastal population of Blue iguanas which was gradually displaced or extirpated by human settlements and the construction of roads.; The Blue iguana now only occurs inland in natural xerophytic shrubland and along the interfaces between farm clearings, roads, and gardens and closed-canopy dry forest or shrubland.;; The interior population is believed to have been attracted to agricultural clearings and fruit farms which provide thermoregulatory opportunities, herbaceous browse, fallen fruit, and nesting soil, but this also brought the Blue iguana into contact with humans and feral animals.; Females often migrate to coastal areas to nest.;

;

Blue iguanas released into the Queen ElizabethII Botanical Park on Grand Cayman were radiotracked in 2004 to determine ranges for each animal.;

;Females were found to occupy territories of 0.6 acres and males an average of 1.4 acres with overlap in common usage areas, indicating that the Blue iguanas chose to maintain a population density of 4-5 animals per hectare.;

The Blue iguanas occupy rock holes and tree cavities, and as adults are primarily terrestrial.;Younger individuals tend to be more arboreal.;Hatchlings are preyed upon by the native snake ''Alsophis cantherigerus''.; The adults have no natural predators but can fall victim to feral dogs.;; They typically reach sexual maturity at three to four years of age.;

Diet and longevity
Like all ''Cyclura'' species, the Blue iguana is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from over 45 different plant species.;; This diet is very rarely supplemented with insect larvae, crabs, slugs, dead birds, and fungi.;;

Longevity in the wild is unknown but is presumed to be many decades. A Blue iguana named &quot;Godzilla&quot; captured on Grand Cayman in 1950 by naturalist Ira Thompson was imported to the United States in 1985 by Ramon Noegel and sold to Tom Crutchfield in 1990.;

; Crutchfield donated Godzilla to the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas in 1997 and the lizard remained there until its death in 2004.;

;;; Thompson estimated the iguana to be 15 years of age at the time of his capture.; At 69 years of age (54 in captivity), this lizard may be the world's longest-living lizard of which there is reliable record.; In addition, a closely related Lesser Caymans iguana (''C. nubila caymanensis'') has been documented as living 33 years in captivity.;

;

Mating
Mating occurs from May through June.;; Copulation is preceded by numerous head-bobs on the part of the male, who then circles around behind the female and grasps the nape of her neck.; He then attempts to restrain the female in order to maneuver his tail under hers to position himself for intromission.; Copulation generally lasts from 30 to 90 seconds, and a pair is rarely observed mating more than once or twice a day.;

; Anywhere from one to twenty-one eggs are usually laid in June or July depending on the size and age of the female, in nests excavated in pockets of earth exposed to the sun.;;;

; It has been noted that ''Cyclura'' eggs are some of the largest eggs laid by any lizard.;

Individuals are aggressively territorial from the age of about 3 months onward.;

; Females occupy overlapping usage areas of the order of 0.6 acres (0.24ha), seemingly regardless of age, while males occupy progressively larger and more extensively overlapping usage areas as they age and grow.;

Conservation
=Endangered status=
The Blue iguana is critically endangered according to the current IUCN Red List.; The population is restricted to the eastern interior of Grand Cayman, where it had been reduced to a critically low level, only three animals having been observed prior to the survey in 1988.;;

;The range of the Blue iguana has contracted significantly over the last 25 years, with many sites once populated now showing no signs of wild iguanas.; Surveys in 2003 indicated a total population in the range of 5-15 individuals.; By 2005 the unmanaged wild population was considered to be functionally extinct.;; The species is one of the most endangered animals on Earth.;;

;

As the Blue iguana consumes a variety of plant material, favoring fruits and flowers over leaves and stems when available it is valuable on Grand Cayman as a seed disperser throughout its range.;;; A study in 2000 by Dr Allison Alberts revealed that seeds passing through the digestive tracts of ''Cycluras'' germinate more rapidly than those that do not.;

;;These seeds in the fruits consumed by the Blue iguana have an adaptive advantage by sprouting before the end of very short rainy seasons.;The Blue iguana is also an important means of distributing seeds to new areas and, as the largest native herbivore of Grand Cayman's ecosystems, it is essential for maintaining the delicate balance between climate and vegetation necessary to survive under harsh conditions.;

;

Restored free-roaming subpopulations in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park and the Salina Reserve numbered approximately 125 individuals in total after a release in December 2005.; The restored subpopulation in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park has been breeding since 2001, and the subpopulation in the Salina Reserve was deemed to be breeding in 2006 after a nest of three hatched eggs was discovered in the wild.;
;;

; As of April 2007, after another large scale release, there are 299 blue iguanas living in the wild, with hundreds more being raised in captivity on Grand Cayman.;
;

=Causes of decline=
Habitat destruction is the main factor threatening imminent extinction for this iguana. Land clearance within remnant habitat is occurring for agriculture, road construction, and real estate development and speculation.; Conversion of traditional croplands to cattle pasture is also eliminating secondary Blue iguana habitat.;

;

Predation and injury to hatchlings by rats, to hatchlings and sub-adults by feral cats, and killing of adults by roaming dogs are all placing severe pressure on the remaining wild population.;; Road kill is an increasing cause of mortality. Trapping and shooting is a comparatively minor concern, but occasional trapping continues despite legal protection and sustained efforts to increase public awareness.;;;;

;

The common Green iguana, (''Iguana iguana''), has been introduced from Honduras and is well-established on Grand Cayman as an invasive species. It far outnumbers the endemic Blue iguana.; ;;

; No direct negative consequences of this introduction on the Blue iguana are known, but the mere presence of the Green iguana confuses public attitudes and understanding.;; For example, the people of the island are told that Blue iguanas are endangered and rare, and when they subsequently see large numbers of the introduced Green iguana, they don't understand the difference.;;

;

Live Blue iguanas used to regularly be sold to tourists as pets, as their rarity made them appealing to exotic-animal collectors, despite this being illegal under the CITES treaty.; In 1999 a World Wildlife Fund international conservation officer, Stuart Chapman, said, &quot;The British government has turned a blind eye for over 20 years to these overseas territories which are home to many rare and endangered species. Many of these face extinction if Britain fails to honour its treaty obligations. The British Caribbean islands are extremely rich in biodiversity with many critically endangered species that are unique to the islands - yet there is virtually zero enforcement or implementation of CITES.&quot;;
;

The wild population of Grand Cayman Blue iguanas had been reduced from a near island-wide distribution to a barely viable, increasingly fragmented remnant owing to the combined influences of habitat conversion, hunting, introduction of non-native predatory species, and road kill.;; By 2001, no young hatched in the unmanaged wild population were surviving to breeding age, meaning the population was functionally extinct, with only five animals remaining in the wild.;

=Recovery efforts=
In 1990 the American Zoo and Aquarium Association(AZA) designated the genus ''Cyclura'' as their highest priority.;

; Their first project was an ''in situ'' captive breeding program for the blue iguana, which at the time was the most critically endangered of all the species of ''Cyclura''.;

One of the early difficulties the program encountered was that the captive stock of the early 1990s was found not to be pure.;; It was discovered through DNA analysis and blood work that the captive population contained a number of individual animals that were hybrids with ''C. nubila caymanensis''.;; The program now contains only pure specimens, as these hybrids were sterilized by means of hemipenectomies and removed from the breeding program.;;;

This program was created in order to determine the exact genealogies of the limited gene pool of the remaining animals.; It was determined through DNA analysis that the entire North American captive population which was to be used as a base for reviving the species was descended from a single pair of animals.; After five years of research two captive breeding populations were established and are managed as a single unit, with bloodline exchanges to promote genetic diversity.;

As a hedge against disaster striking the Blue iguana population on Grand Cayman, an off-island captive population was established in 25 zoos in the USA.;; A minimum of 20 founder lines represented by at least 225 individuals is being maintained by captive breeding and recorded in a studbook for the species by Tandora Grant of the San Diego Zoo's Center for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species (CRES).;;;The Indianapolis zoo has had success with breeding the Blue iguana in captivity over a period of seven years.; ;

In October 2006, hatchlings were released into the wild for the first time to boost the species and help bring them back from the brink of extinction.;

; Each released blue iguana wears a string of colored beads around its neck for visual identification at a distance, backed up by an implanted microchip and a high-resolution photograph of its head scales.; (Head scale patterns are as unique among blue iguanas as fingerprints are among humans.);

Blue Iguana Recovery Programme
Efforts to save the Blue iguana are being implemented as of 2007 by the Blue Iguana Recovery Programme (BIRP) which, with local and international partners, operates under the auspices of the National Trust for the Cayman Islands.; This program operates under a special exemption from provisions in the Animals Law of the Cayman Islands which normally would make it illegal for anyone to kill, capture, or keep iguanas.;; 

BIRP's conservation strategy involves generating large numbers of genetically diverse hatchlings, head-starting them to an age where their chance of survival in the wild is high, and using these animals to rebuild a series of wild sub-populations in protected, managed natural areas.;;

; &quot;Head-starting&quot; means raising the animals in captivity from the time they hatch until they are big enough not to fall prey to feral cats and rodents, thereby offsetting the juvenile mortality rate. This is accompanied by field research, nest site protection, and monitoring of the released animals.;

;;;
; A rapid numerical increase from a maximum possible number of founding stock is sought to minimize loss of genetic diversity caused by the &quot;population bottleneck&quot;.; BIRP maintains these hatchlings for two years before their release into the wild.;

Maintenance of Blue iguanas in the wild requires active management into the indefinite future.; To sustain this activity, a range of commercial activities generates the funding required, while an ongoing education and awareness effort ensures continued involvement and support by the local community.;;;

; Habitat protection is still vital, as the Salina reserve can only support a few hundred iguanas.;;;The Salina Reserve has only 88 acres (35.6ha) of dry shrubland, which is not enough to sustain the 1,000 blue iguanas that must be restored to the wild to get this species off the Critically Endangered List.;;

When the restored wild sub-populations have reached the carrying capacity of their respective protected areas, release of head-started animals will be phased out, and the sub-populations will be left to reproduce naturally.; In addition, guided by research and monitoring, control or eradication of non-native predators will be implemented to the degree necessary to allow young blue iguanas to survive to maturity in sufficient numbers to maintain these sub-populations.;; 

Restored sub-populations are already present in two non-contiguous areas—the Salina Reserve and the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park.; Additional separate sub-populations will be restored in one or more other areas.; The overall captive population, which must number at least 1,000 individuals, is likely to remain genetically fragmented in the long term.; Individuals will be translocated between sub-populations to maintain gene flow so that the entire population remains a single genetic unit.;;

Captivity

The Blue Iguana is established in captivity, both in public and private collections.;There are very few purebred animals in private collections. Private individuals have established these animals in captive breeding programs primarily as hybrids with the Lesser Caymans iguana(''C.nubila caymanensis'') and occasionally hybrids with the Cuban iguana(''C.n.nubila'')minimizing the demand for wild-caught specimens for the pet trade.;
