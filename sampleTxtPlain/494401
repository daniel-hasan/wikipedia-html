 is a small town located in Nishiuwa District, Ehime, Japan.Following a recent merger with the neighboring towns of Misaki and Seto, the town now spans the mountainous Sadamisaki Peninsula, the narrowest peninsula in Japan and the westernmost point on the island of Shikoku.

This unique geography has greatly influenced Ikata's growth.On the one hand, it has presented significant challenges to urban development that were not overcome until recently in the town's long history.On the other, the peninsula is what gives the town its beautiful mountain and ocean scenery which, bolstered by significant investments in infrastructure and tourist facilities, has formed the basis for a burgeoning tourism industry.

In addition to the beauty of its rugged, natural landscape, Ikata has long been known for fishing and mikan orange farming.In recent years Ikata has also become a hotspot of modern energy production—the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant produces much of Shikoku's electricity, and the town's windy mountains are dotted by dozens of windmills.

History
=Prehistory=
The Sadamisaki Peninsula area has been inhabited since at least the Jōmon Period (10,000–300 BC), as evidenced by the discovery of stone tools and earthenware pots in the Misaki and Kushi neighborhoods.;

| date = March 31, 1987 }};

In 1963 a local man discovered a stone ax dating back to the mid-Yayoi Period (300 BC–250 AD) in his farm plot in the Kawachi neighborhood.Upon further investigation by the Japan Archaeological Society in 1986, the area was recognized as containing the remains of a .This is a type of settlement usually located several tens of meters above the surrounding area on mountainsides, and is peculiar to the Yayoi period.;

=Classical era=
After the Taika Reform of 646, Ikata and the greater surrounding area became known as the Uwa District in 701. The Uwa District covered the entire Nanyo region (:Image:Ehime-nanyo.svg|map) until it was split in two in 866.Since districts were defined by population, one can infer that the area was underdeveloped and sparsely populated at the time.;

=Feudal era=
The Horikiri Bridge (lit. &quot;trench-cutting bridge&quot;), spans the gorge where Nobutaka attempted to dig a canal through the peninsula
Towards the end of the Heian Period, the Yawatahama and Ikata area became known as .As ownership of farmlands became increasingly concentrated in the hands of local ruling families, control of the Yano area was given to Taira no Tadamitsu, a member of the Heike clan.;

Some members of the Heike family secretly settled in the Seto area in 1185 after being defeated in the Genpei Wars.; [http://www.town.ikata.ehime.jp/gappei/kaisai/pdf/ho_shiryo09.pdf Ikata-Seto-Misaki Merger Conference No. 9 Reference Material], September 29 2005 (PDF).;

Entering the Edo Period and the Tokugawa shogunate, the Uwa District came under control of the . From 1610 to 1612, the first Uwajima feudal lord, Tomita Nobutaka, gathered farmers from the local area to dig a canal through the thinnest part of the Sadamisaki Peninsula, Seto's Mitsukue neighborhood.The project was soon canceled due to insufficient funds.By this time, the namecan be seen in records of taxes paid to the feudal lords.;

The Mitsukue neighborhood prospered as a port town during the feudal period, as it was used as a port of rest for daimyos on their way to and from the capital as part of the sankin kōtai system.This traffic was likely the source of the demand for Nobutaka's abortive attempt to create a shortcut through the peninsula.;

=Modern era=
The Nine War Heroes monument in Suka Park
A decade after the Meiji Restoration, in March 1878 the Uwa District was divided into the current Kitauwa, Minamiuwa, Higashiuwa, and Nishiuwa districts (North-, South-, East-, and West-Uwa, respectively). Ikata was designated ain 1889, and other neighborhoods along the peninsula soon followed suit.

More recently, Ikata's Seto's Mitsukue Bay was used for submarine training operations by the Japanese navy leading up to World War II, as the bay's shape is similar to that of Pearl Harbor.; [http://www.hotta-grp.co.jp/web/akebono/omoide/2007_03.php Hotta Construction Corp. &quot;Memories of Past Construction Projects&quot; No. 10 (March 2007)].; A monument namedstands in Suka Park in Mitsukue as a memorial dedicated to the nine young men (ages 21–28) who were stationed in the Mitsukue area for these exercises.According to the plaque on the monument, the men were quite friendly with the locals, and stories are still told about them in the neighborhood to this day.The men died on December 8 1941, during one of the initial attacks on Pearl Harbor.

In 1977 the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant began operation as the first nuclear power plant on the island of Shikoku.

On April 1 2005, Ikata merged with the nearby towns of Misaki and Seto to create the new town of Ikata, which spans the Sadamisaki Peninsula.

Geography and climate
Image:伊方町全図.svg|right|thumb|250px|A map of Ikata's neighborhoods
Ikata is on the Sadamisaki peninsula, Japan's narrowest peninsula and the westernmost point on the island of Shikoku.The peninsula is extremely mountainous, with steep cliffs and precious little usable flat land.To combat this, the town's bays and ponds have seen vigorous coastal reclamation efforts dating back to the early Meiji period (late 1800s).;Ikata's mountainsides are covered with terraced mikan fields, and natural forest in the undeveloped areas.

The various neighborhoods of Ikata are found nestled among the foothills of the mountains, connected only by winding coastal roads and a single highway, Route 197.The biggest of the neighborhoods and the administrative center of Ikata is Minatoura, near the eastern edge of the town.

Ikata is surrounded on three sides by ocean—the Iyo Sea (part of the Inland Sea) to the north, the Uwa Sea (Pacific Ocean) to the south, and the Hōyo Strait (separating Shikoku from Kyūshū) to the west.

The climate in Ikata is warm, with an average year-round temperature of 16–17 °C (61–63 °F) and 1,500ml of yearly rain. The coldest parts of winter remain above freezing (5 °C or 41 °F on average), with snowfall seen only once or twice per year. Rain is concentrated in the rainy season in June and July, and also in September.; [http://www.town.ikata.ehime.jp/life/life_detail.html?lif_id=555 Town of Ikata: Moving to Ikata].;

The length of the peninsula makes accurate weather prediction difficult for the town; when driving down Melody Line, it is not uncommon to find it sunny between one set of tunnels, rainy between another, and foggy between yet another. Ikata's position, stretching out into the ocean, also makes it a frequent target for typhoons.

Demographics
Ikata's population broken down by region
Ikata is a small town, with a population of 12,363 as of May 31, 2007.The total area of the town is 94.37&amp;nbsp;km², making the population density 131 persons per km².However, much of the land on the peninsula is quite mountainous and not suited for development; the population density of the individual settlements, which are squeezed into the small bay areas in the foothills of the mountains, is much higher, though reliable statistics are not known.

Like much of rural Japan, Ikata faces a rapidly declining and aging population.According to the Ikata website, nearly 40% of the town's population is 65 or older.;[http://www.town.ikata.ehime.jp/english/prof/toukei.php Town of Ikata: Statistics].;Furthermore, many elementary and middle schools have closed since the 1970s.Those that remain have very small student populations.For example, Ikata Elementary School is Ikata's largest elementary school; there were 303 students in 1987, and only 162 in 2006; Toyonoura Elementary is Old Ikata's smallest school; it had 51 students in 1987, and only 14 in 2007.;

Seto's population, broken down by age
This population issue was a significant part of the impetus for the recent merger of Old Ikata with Seto and Misaki.While Old Ikata is geographically more accessible, and has enjoyed the economic benefits of the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant, Seto and Misaki have experienced even more severe aging and decline of their populations.In 2000, Seto's working-age population dipped below 50% of its total.;

Ethnically Ikata is extremely homogeneous with only a handful of non-Japanese residents, most of whom are either temporary farm laborers from China, or English educators on the JET Programme.

;

Transportation and sightseeing
=History=
Due to Ikata's length and mountainous terrain, regular bus service did not reach the tip of the peninsula until the 1960s. Until then, the only public transportation available was local ferries that connected the bays of each neighborhood. Unfavorable weather patterns made ferry service difficult on the Inland Sea side, so most of Ikata's settlements are on the southern, Pacific Ocean side.

In 1963, the original Route 197 was completed. It follows the coastline, and is thus extremely winding and narrow, with very little room for cars to pass. Traversing the peninsula by this route takes hours and can be quite nerve-wracking; this earned it the ire of the locals, who came up with a disparaging nickname that is as a pun on the actual name: .; [http://www.kinkikensetsu.co.jp/topics/chishiki/hosou/route/r197.html Kinki Kensetsu K.K.: Ehime Roads];

=Modern day=
A ferry from Saganoseki pulls into Misaki Port
The Ikata leg of the new Route 197 was completed in 1987 and is the heart of transportation in modern Ikata, affectionately nicknamed &quot;Melody Line&quot;.Unlike the old roads, Melody Line boasts two full lanes and runs relatively straight down the peninsula.Seated high in the mountains, drivers can enjoy views of both the Pacific Ocean and Inland Sea.The route terminates at Misaki and continues over to Kyūshū by ferries that connect Misaki Port with Saganoseki (Ōita, Ōita) and Beppu, Ōita.

Melody Line is such an improvement over the old roads that it has become a significant Ehime sightseeing attraction in itself, with many tourists coming to see cherry blossoms in the spring.Together with the city of Iyo's seaside Route 378, Melody Line makes one of the prefecture's recommended sightseeing routes,; [http://www.pref.ehime.jp/izanai/route/route8/index.html Refreshing Seaside Drive from Sadamisaki through the Sunset Line].; and one of JTB's .; [http://freett.com/shou_ta/hyaku/hikyou01.htm &quot;100 Best&quot; Adventure Club: Japan's Hidden Treasures].;

Iyo Railway bus service runs up and down the peninsula, to and from Yawatahama, and offers express buses from Misaki to Matsuyama.However, commuter buses run infrequently and, due to the length of the peninsula and the scattered nature of the town's neighborhoods, bus travel remains more expensive and less convenient than in denser areas.Some tour buses also come across the strait from Kyūshū by ferry.

There are no trains in Ikata. The closest station is the JR Yawatahama Station on the Yosan Line.

Culture
=Etymology of name=
The origin of the name ''Ikata'' is unclear and there are several competing theories.;
*It may have come fromor , meaning &quot;a place with small houses or shacks&quot;.; 
| publisher = [http://www.jinbutsu.co.jp/ Shin-Jinbutsuoraisha Co., Ltd]
| date = February 1981 }};
*''Ika'' can be found in the names of places surrounded by mountains or located in foothills; ''ta'' can mean &quot;land&quot;.''Ikata'' could therefore be &quot;a place by the mountains&quot;.
*In the Ainu language, ''ika'' means &quot;to pass through the mountains and cross the land&quot;.However, the Ainu are thought to have had little influence as far south as Shikoku.

=Food=
Ikata is known for its mikans and mikan juice.More than 20 different varieties of mikan are grown in Ikata.;[http://www.town.ikata.ehime.jp/english/life/ Citrus fruits grown in Ikata].;Old Ikata also has a very old sake brewing tradition that dates back to the Edo Period, with several Tōji (brewmaster)|tōji brewmasters in the local area.There is even a museum dedicated to the Ikata Tōji.;[http://www.town.ikata.ehime.jp/english/shisetsu/ikatamorishi.php Ikata Tōji Museum].;

One Ikata specialty cuisine is , a tempura-fried patty of pressed white fish meat and vegetables.Other variations include , which is the same but fried and breaded like tonkatsu, andwhich is prepared like a croquette.

=Language=
Residents of Ikata speak the Iyo dialect of Japanese, which is similar in many respects to the Japanese dialects#Chūgoku|Hiroshima dialect.One feature particular to the Nanyo (southern Ehime) region is the use of the sentence-final particle ''ga'' (が) as a replacement for ''no'' (の) in some contexts. For example, ''Nani shiteru no?'' (何してるの？ &quot;What are you doing?&quot; in standard Japanese) becomes ''Nani shiyoru ga?'' (何しよるが？) in Iyo dialect.; [http://www33.ocn.ne.jp/%7Ekotaro_mil/hougen.htm Kōtarō Miscellaneous Information Laboratory: Iyo Dialect Dictionary];

Ikata's largest town celebration in late summer, the Kinahaiya Ikata Festival, is another example of the Iyo dialect—''kinahai ya'' (来なはいや) literally means &quot;come on over&quot; (''kinasai yo'' 来なさいよ in standard Japanese).

Local legend tells of a giant crab, eight tatami mats in size, that lives in the Kamegaike Pond in Old Ikata's Futami neighborhood.; [http://www33.ocn.ne.jp/~kotaro_mil/iyosumi/towninfo/ikata.htm#亀ヶ池の大蟹 The Corners of Iyo: Ikata: The giant crab of Kamegaike].;


Industry
Ikata's main industries are farming (largely citrus fruits such as mikans), fishing, and electrical power.Ikata produces a substantial fraction of Shikoku's electricity.There are two main power production methods currently in use.
=Wind power=
Windmills at the Seto Wind Hill Park

The former town of Seto erected eleven Mitsubishi MWT-1000 wind generators in January 2002.The Old Ikata installed two Vestas V52-850kW generators in March 2005.Together they have an expected yearly energy output of 34,700 MWh.

Ikata is investing heavily in wind power infrastructure, with 45 additional towers currently under construction.The town plans to have a total of 60 generators within the next few years.

=Nuclear power=

Ikata Nuclear Power Plant
Ikata is the site of Shikoku's only nuclear power plant. The Ikata Nuclear Power Plant has two Mitsubishi 538 MWe Pressurized Water Reactor units with the Two Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the original Westinghouse design at Prairie Island, Kewaunee, and Point Beach plants) and one Mitsubishi Pressurized Water Reactor unit with the Three Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the Westinghouse Surry, North Anna, and H. B. Robinson Nuclear Generating Station|Robinson plants). Units 1 and 2 started up on September 30 1977 and March 19 1981 respectively. Unit 3 is a three loop PWR rated at 846 MWe that started up on December 15 1994.

April 1, 2007, marked a milestone for the Ikata plant as it reached a total of 300 million watt-hour|kilowatt-hours of energy generated since beginning operations in 1977.;''Hassei Area &amp; Yonden Information Press'', Shikoku Electric Power Co., Inc., No. 393, May 2007;

The Ikata Power Plant was referenced in the 1995 movie Godzilla vs. Destoroyah. Godzilla attempts to attack the power plant, but meets resistance from the Japan Self-Defense Force|Self Defense Force's &quot;Super-X III&quot; weapon.

International exchange and sister cities

Relations with Ikata's only overseas sister city, Red Wing, Minnesota, USA, originally began as an exchange of technical knowledge and skills between engineers at the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant and Red Wing's Prairie Island plant.The two towns became official sister cities in August 1995.

Since then, Ikata has put much effort into expanding the horizons of its residents through English language education via the JET Programme, and an annual international student exchange with Red Wing.Beginning in 1995, Ikata middle school students have traveled almost yearly to Red Wing for home stays of one to two weeks, and students from Red Wing likewise come to Ikata to learn about life in rural Japan.;[http://www.town.ikata.ehime.jp/english/kokusai/ Town of Ikata: International Relations].;

Ikata's high school, Misaki High School, maintains an exchange program with Australia.

Ikata has two sister cities, both of which also have nuclear power plants:
* Tomari, Japan, since February 1998
* Red Wing, Minnesota, United States, since August 1995

;

Politics

Ikata experienced significant political turbulence leading up to and immediately following the April 1, 2005 merger with Seto and Misaki.

To begin with, multiple potential merger plans were put forth, one of which was for all of the Nishiuwa District towns (Misaki, Seto, Old Ikata, and Honai) to merge.However, when Honai announced that it would merge with the nearby city of Yawatahama, polls indicated that Misaki residents still preferred to merge with Honai and Yawatahama, rather than Seto and Old Ikata, despite their being discontiguous (a Misaki-Honai-Yawatahama merger would make Misaki an exclave).Ultimately this was found to be impractical, and the Misaki-Seto-Ikata merger was approved with some grumbling over the naming of the new town.

Once the merger was decided upon, suggestions for the new town's name were solicited from the residents.Despite the many other reasonable suggestions; [http://www.town.ikata.ehime.jp/gappei/hiroba/shinchomei_7koho.html Naming suggestions for the new town of Ikata].; and the seeming unfairness toward Seto and Misaki, the &quot;new&quot; name was chosen to be &quot;Ikata&quot;.

Following the merger a heated mayoral race was held, with 11 members of incumbent Kiyoyoshi Nakamoto's campaign arrested for electoral fraud.Challenger Yoshihisa Hatanaka ultimately won, only to be arrested in February of 2006 for corruption relating to government construction contracts.He resigned soon thereafter.

A second race was held in April 2006, with Kazuhiko Yamashita defeating rival Kiyohiko Takakado by only 90 votes.Voter turnout was 87.43%.; [http://www.senkyo.janjan.jp/election/2006/38/00002232.html The Senkyo: Ikata Mayoral Race];

There has been and still remains political resistance among some Ikata residents to the nuclear power plant.Most recently this has revolved around the now-approved plan to implement MOX fuel in Unit 3 of the Ikata plant.
