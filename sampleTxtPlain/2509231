Shai is an early 1990s vocal Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B/soul quartet. Their biggest hit was an a cappella single, &quot;If I Ever Fall in Love&quot;, which made #2 in the U.S. Top 40.

Band history

Shai was formed at Howard University in Washington D.C. Three of the four members, Marc Gay, Carl Martin, and Darnell Van Rensalier, belonged to the same fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha, and along with good friend, Garfield A. Bright (b. 12 October 1969), decided to take a chance at turning their hobby of singing into a career. While still in DC, Carl met a DJ from WPGC at a softball game and passed the demo, &quot;If I Ever Fall in Love&quot; to the DJ.That same week the DJ played it on air.Other stations soon followed, and suddenly the record labels came calling. After signing with Gasoline Alley, Shai began putting together their debut album.

Carl E. Martin wrote the chart-busting single &quot;If I Ever Fall In Love&quot; on his long ride back from his home in Louisiana to Washington, DC.The song was written about his ex-girlfriend Camille, who also attended Howard University.

&quot;If I Ever Fall in Love&quot; was the first single and peaked at #2 in the U.S. The next two releases from the double-platinum album, &quot;Comforter&quot; and &quot;Baby I'm Yours&quot; both reached #10. The group's next CD was ''Right Back At Cha'', a remix album largely consisting of new versions of their previous hits. A revised version of the song &quot;Baby I'm Yours&quot; simply titled &quot;Yours&quot; was released from it, and peaked at #63. 

Shai returned in 1994 with &quot;The Place Where You Belong&quot;, from the Beverly Hills Cop III soundtrack. It was the group's final Top 40 single. In late 1995 their followup album ''Blackface'' was released (#42 Pop, #15 R&amp;B). It featured Shai's final R&amp;B Top 20 single, &quot;Come With Me&quot; (#43 Pop). The group's last chart appearance was the followup single, 1996's #89 single &quot;I Don't Wanna Be Alone&quot; (the remix featuring Jay-Z), although they have continued to record. 1999's album ''Destiny'' was recorded without Carl Martin (who left the group after ''Blackface'' release), and their latest 2004 studio album ''Back From The Mystery System ... The Love Cycle'' was done with new Shai member - Erik Willis.

Miscellanea

Shai made a guest appearance on a 1992 episode of ''Family Matters'', during a dream sequence in which Laura Winslow fantasizes about the four young men in the band...until they all turn into doppelgangers of her nemesis, Steve Urkel.

&quot;If I Ever Fall In Love&quot; was one of 12 songs American Idol contestants could choose to sing during Hollywood week of Season 5. There are several cover versions of this song, including ''If you ever'' by East 17 feat. Gabrielle.

Their song &quot;Yours&quot; was used in Seaquest DSV episode &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot; as the background music in a scene where Jonathan Brandis attempts to kiss Kellie Martin. See Seaquest DSV episode list Season One.
