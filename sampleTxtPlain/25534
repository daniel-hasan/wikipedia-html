 ;The constitution of the Republic of Moldova refers to the country's language as ''Moldovan'' rather than ''Romanian'', though in practice it is often called &quot;Romanian&quot;. The introduction of the law concerning the functioning of the languages (September 1989), still effective in Moldova according to the Constitution [http://www.parlament.md/law/constitution/t7/], asserts the linguistic identity between the Romanian language and the Moldovan language.

Romanian (''limba română'', ) is a Romance language spoken by around 24 to 28 million people;, primarily in Romania and Moldova. It has official status in Romania, Moldova and the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in Serbia. The official form of the Moldovan language ; in the Republic of Moldova is identical to the official form of Romanian, although prior to 2000, there existed a minor difference in spelling, that was finally abolished.;The new edition of „Dicţionarul ortografic al limbii române (ortoepic, morfologic, cu norme de punctuaţie)” &amp;ndash; introduced by the Academy of Sciences of Moldova and recommended for publishing following the board reunion on 15 November 2000 &amp;ndash; applies the decision of the General Meeting of the Romanian Academy from 17 February 1993, regarding the return to „â” and „sunt” in the orthography of the Romanian language. ([http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine:Asm_lbro3.jpg Introduction, Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova]) The decision is mandatory in schools and other official use of the language.; Romanian is also an official or administrative language in various communities and organisations (such as the Latin Union and the European Union).

Romanian speakers are also found in many other countries, notably in Italy, Spain, Israel, Portugal, United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, France and Germany.

History

Map of Balkans with regions inhabited by Romanians/Vlachs highlighted
The Romanian territory was inhabited in ancient times by the Dacians, an Indo-European people. They were defeated by the Roman Empire in 106 and part of Dacia (Oltenia, Banat and Transylvania) became a Roman province. Because the province was rich in ores, and especially silver and gold ,;; the Romans heavily colonized the province,;; brought with them the Vulgar Latin as the language of administration and commerce, and started a period of intense romanization (giving birth to proto-Romanian language.;; ;; But in the 3rd century AD, with the pressure of Free Dacians and invasions of migratory populations such as Goths, the Roman Empire was forced to pull out of Dacia in 271 AD, thus making it the first province to be abandoned. ;; ;; Whether the Romanians are the descendants of these people that abandoned the area and settled south of the Danube or of the people that remained in Dacia is a matter of debate. (''See also Origin of the Romanians.'')

Due to its geographical isolation, Romanian was probably among the first of the Romance languages that split from Latin. It received little influence from other Romance languages until the modern period (until the middle of the 18th century), which can explain why it is one of the most uniform languages in Europe. It is the most important of the remaining Eastern Romance languages and more conservative than other Romance languages in nominal morphology. Romanian has preserved declension, but whereas Latin had seven cases, Romanian has five&quot; the nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and the vocative, and still holds the neuter gender as well. However, the verb morphology of Romanian has shown the same move towards a compound perfect and future tense as the other Romance languages.

All the dialects of Romanian are believed to have been unified in a Proto-Romanian language up to sometime between the 7th and 10th centuries, when the area came under the influence of the Byzantine Empire. It was then when Romanian became influenced by the Slavic languages and to some degree the Greek. For example, Aromanian, one of the closest relatives of Romanian, has very few Slavic words. Also, the variations in the Daco-Romanian dialect (spoken throughout Romania and Moldova) are very small. The use of this uniform Daco-Romanian dialect extends well beyond the borders of the Romanian state: a Romanian-speaker from Moldova speaks the same language as a Romanian-speaker from the Serbian Banat. Romanian was influenced by Slavic (due to migration/assimilation, and feudal/ecclesiastical relations), Greek (Byzantine, then Phanariote), Turkish, and Hungarian, while the other Romance languages adopted words and features of Germanic.

Romanian is spoken mostly in Southeastern Europe, although speakers of the language can be found all over the world, mostly due to emigration of Romanian nationals and the return of immigrants from Romania to their original countries. Romanian speakers account for 0,5% of the world's population,; [http://dtil.unilat.org/LI/2005/ro/rezultatele_detaliate.htm Latin Union - Languages and cultures online 2005]; and 4% of the Romance-speaking population of the world.;[http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500404/Languages_Spoken_by_More_Than_10_Million_People.htmlMSN Encarta - Languages Spoken by More Than 10 Million People];

Romanian is the single official and national language in Romania and Moldova, although it shares the official status at regional level with other languages in the Moldovan autonomies of Gagauzia and Transnistria. Romanian is also an official language of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in Serbia along with five other languages. Romanian minorities are encountered in Serbia (Timok Valley), Ukraine (Chernivtsi and Odessa oblasts), Hungary (Gyula) and Bulgaria (Vidin). Large immigrant communities are found in Italy, Spain, France, and Portugal.

The largest Romanian-speaking community in Asia is found in Israel, where as of 1995 Romanian is spoken by 5% of the population.;According to the 1993 ''Statistical Abstract of Israel'' there were 250,000 Romanian speakers in Israel, at a population of 5,548,523 (census 1995).;;[http://www.eurojewcong.org/ejc/news.php?id_article=110 Reports of about 300,000 Jews that left the country after WW2]; Romanian is also spoken as a second language by people from Arabic-speaking countries that have studied in Romania. It is estimated that almost half a million Middle Eastern Arabs studied in Romania during the 1980s.;[http://www.evz.ro/article.php?artid=185041 Evenimentul Zilei]; Small Romanian-speaking communities are to be found in Kazakhstan and Russia. Romanian is also spoken within communities of Romanian and Moldovan immigrants in the United States, Canada and Australia, although they don't make up a large homogeneous community state-wide.

=Legal status in Romania=
According to the Constitution of Romania of 1991, as revised in 2003, Romanian is the official language of the Republic.;[http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=1 Constitution of Romania];

Romania mandates the use of Romanian in official government publications, public education and legal contracts; advertisements must bear a translation of foreign words.

The Romanian Language Institute (''Institutul Limbii Române''), established by the Ministry of Education of Romania, promotes Romanian and supports people willing to study the language, working together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Department for Romanians Abroad.;[http://www.edu.ro/index.php/articles/c262/ Ministry of Education of Romania];

=Legal status in Moldova=

About 10% of the world's Romanian-speaking population is Moldovan, and Romanian is the single official language of Moldova. In the Constitution, the language is officially called Moldovan, although most linguists consider it to be largely identical to Romanian. It is also used in schools, mass media, education and in the colloquial speech and writing is often called &quot;Romanian&quot;. Romanian has been the only official language of Moldova since the endorsement of the law on language of the Moldavian SSR. This law, still in force today, mandates the use of Moldovan in all the political, economical, cultural and social spheres, as it also asserts the existence of a &quot;linguistic Moldo-Romanian identity&quot;. ;[http://www.iatp.md/ladom/downloads/M3.doc Legea cu privire la functionarea limbilor vorbite pe teritoriul RSS Moldovenesti Nr.3465-XI din 01.09.89 Vestile nr.9/217, 1989] (Law regarding the usage of languages spoken on the territory of the Republic of Moldova): ''&quot;Moldavian RSS supports the desire of the Moldovans that live across the borders of the Republic, and considering the really existing linguistical Moldo-Romanian identity - of the Romanians that live on the territory of the USSR, of doing their studies and satisfying their cultural needs in their maternal language.&quot;''; In the unrecognized state of Transnistria, it is co-official with Ukrainian and Russian.

In the 2004 census, out of the 3,383,332 people living in Moldova, 16.5% (558,508) stated Romanian as their mother tongue, whereas 60% stated Moldovan. While 40% of all urban Romanian/Moldovan speakers chose Romanian as their mother tongue, in the countryside under 12% of Romanian/Moldovan speakers indicated Romanian as their mother tongue.;National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova: [http://www.statistica.md/recensamint.php?lang=ro Census 2004]; However, the group of experts from the international census observation Mission to the Republic of Moldova concluded that the items in the questionnaire dealing with nationality and language proved to be the most sensitive ones, particularly with reference to the recording of responses to these questions as being &quot;Moldovan&quot; or &quot;Romanian&quot;, and therefore it concluded that special care would need to be taken in using them.;[http://azi.md/news?ID=34282 Experts Offering to Consult the National Statistics Bureau in Evaluation of the Census Data], ''Moldova Azi'', May 19, 2005, story attributed to AP Flux.

Places of the world where Romanian is taught as a foreign language. Colour scale varies depending on the amount of centres that teach Romanian language for non-native speakers.
Use of Romanian as a second language is recorded among many of the ethnic minorities in Romania and Moldova. According to a 1979 census in the Moldavian SSR (as it was then), approximately 4% of the population indicated Romanian/Moldovan as their second language ;[http://countrystudies.us/moldova/16.htm Language, religion and culture in the Moldavian SSR];.;

Romanian is taught in some areas that have Romanian minority communities, such as Vojvodina in Serbia, Bulgaria, Ukraine and Hungary. The Romanian Cultural Institute (ICR) has since 1992 organised summer training courses in Romanian for language teachers in these countries.;[http://www.ziua.net/display.php?id=183071&amp;data=2005-08-19&amp;ziua=f08bdeacd2583ee59a42d5f08d1fba7e ''Cursuri de perfecţionare''], published in Ziua on August 19, 2005; In some of the schools, there are non-Romanian nationals who study Romanian as a foreign language (for example the Nicolae Bălcescu High-school in Gyula, Hungary).

Romanian is taught as a foreign language in various tertiary institutions, mostly in neighboring European countries such as Germany, France and Italy, as well as the Netherlands, and elsewhere, like the USA. Overall, it is taught as a foreign language in 38 countries around the world.;Romanian Language Institute: [http://www.old.edu.ro/download/ilrdoc3.pdf Data concerning the teaching of the Romanian language abroad];

= Popular culture=
Romanian has become popular in other countries through movies and songs performed in the Romanian language. Examples of recent Romanian acts that had a great success in non-Roumanophone countries are the bands O-Zone (which had great success with their #1 single ''Dragostea din tei/Numa Numa'' across the world), Akcent (popular in the Netherlands, Poland and other European countries), Activ (successful in some Eastern European countries) as well as high-rated movies like 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, The Death of Mr. Lazarescu, 12:08 East of Bucharest or California Dreamin' (all of them with awards at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival).

The multi-platinum pop trio O-Zone (original from Moldova) released a song called &quot;''Nu mă las de limba noastră''&quot; (in Romanian ''I don't let our language''). The final verse of this song, ''Eu nu mă las de limba noastră, de limba noastră cea română'' is translated in English as ''I don't let our language, our Romanian language''.

= Dialects=


The term &quot;Romanian&quot; in a general sense envelops four hardly mutually intelligible speech varieties commonly regarded as independent languages. It is thought that the Romanian language appeared north and south of the Danube. All the four dialects are offsprings of the Romance language spoken both in the northern and southern Danube, before the settlement of the Slavonian tribes south of the river - Daco-Romanian in the North, and the other three dialects in the south.

However, this article deals primarily with Daco-Romanian, and thus the regional variations of that will be discussed here instead. The differences between these varieties are usually very small, usually consisting in a few dozen regional words and some phonetic changes.

Romanian varieties (''graiuri'');Blue: Southern varieties;Red: Northern varieties

Like all other languages, Romanian can be regarded as a dialect continuum. However, such a formulation tends to obscure the high homogeneity and uniformity of the language. Romanian cannot be neatly divided into separate dialects and Romanians themselves speak of the differences as accents or &quot;speeches&quot; (in Romanian: &quot;accent&quot; or &quot;grai&quot;). This correctly conveys the linguistics notion of accent, as language variants that only feature slight pronunciation differences (Romanian accents are fully mutually intelligible). Several accents are usually distinguished:
* Muntenian accent (Graiul muntenesc), spoken mainly in Wallachia and southern parts of Dobruja.
* Moldavian accent (Graiul moldovenesc), spoken mainly in Moldavia, northern parts of Dobruja and the Republic of Moldova. Written ;;; is realised as /k/; written ;;; before front vowels is realised as . Written ;;;, in final position, is palatalized.

* Banatian accent (Graiul bănăţean), spoken mainly in Banat. Written ;;; before front vowels is realised asand ; as .
* Oltenian accent (Graiul oltenesc), spoken mainly in Oltenia and by the Romanian minority in Timok region of Serbia. In Oltenia a notable dialectal feature is the usage of the Romanian verbs#Verb paradigm|simple perfect tense rather than the compound perfect which is used elsewhere.

Over the last century, however, regional accents have been weakened due to mass communications and greater mobility.

Classification

The place of Romanian within the Romance language family
Romanian is a Romance language, belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family, having much in common with languages such as French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.

However, the languages closest to Romanian are the other Eastern Romance languages, spoken south of Danube: Aromanian/Macedo-Romanian, Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian and Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian, which are sometimes classified as dialects of Romanian. An alternative name for Romanian used by linguists to disambiguate with the other Eastern Romance languages is &quot;Daco-Romanian&quot;, referring to the area where it is spoken (which corresponds roughly to the onetime Roman province of Dacia).

Compared with the major Romance languages, Romanian is closest to Italian, and the two show limited degree of asymmetrical mutual intelligibility, especially in their cultivated forms: speakers of Romanian seem to understand Italian more easily than the other way around. Even though Romanian has obvious lexical and grammatical similarities with French, Catalan, Spanish or Portuguese, it is not mutually intelligible with them to a practical extent; Romanian speakers will usually need some formal study of basic grammar and vocabulary before being able to understand even the simplest sentences in those languages (and vice-versa).

In the following sample sentence (meaning &quot;She always closes the window before having dinner.&quot;) cognates are written in bold:
;

:''Ea semper fenestram claudit antequam cenet.'' (Latin)
:''Ea închide întotdeauna fereastra înainte de a cina.'' (Romanian)
:''Ella chiude sempre la finestra prima di cenare''. (Italian)
:''Elle ferme toujours la fenêtre avant de dîner.'' (French)
:''Ella siempre cierra la ventana antes de cenar.'' (Spanish)
:''Ela fecha sempre a janela antes de jantar.'' (Portuguese)
:''Ella tanca sempre la finestra abans de sopar.'' (Catalan)

On the other hand, Romanian vocabulary has been strongly influenced by French and Italian in the modern times (see #French.2C Italian and other international words|French, Italian and other international words). At present, the lexical similarity with Italian is estimated at 77%, followed by French at 75%, Sardinian 74%, Catalan 73%, Spanish 71%, and Portuguese and Rhaeto-Romance at 72%.;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ron Ethnologue];

= Contacts with other languages=
Dacian language
The Dacian language was an Indo-European language spoken by the ancient Dacians. It may have been the first language to influence the Latin spoken in Dacia, but little is known about it. About 300 words found only in Romanian (in all dialects) or with a cognate in the Albanian language may be inherited from Dacian, many of them being related to pastoral life (for example: ''balaur'' &quot;dragon&quot;, ''brânză'' &quot;cheese&quot;, ''mal'' &quot;shore&quot;;). Some linguists have asserted that Albanians are Dacians who were not Romanized, and migrated south.;Vladimir Georgiev (Gheorghiev),''Raporturile dintre limbile dacă, tracă şi frigiană'', &quot;Studii Clasice&quot; Journal, II, 1960, 39-58;

A different view is that these non-Latin words (many with Albanian cognates) are not necessarily Dacian, but rather were brought into the territory that is modern Romania by Romance-speaking shepherds migrating north from Albania, Serbia, and northern Greece who became the Romanian people. However, the Eastern Romance substratum appears to have been a satem language, while the Paleo-Balkan languages spoken in northern Greece (Ancient Macedonian) and Albania (Illyrian) were most likely centum languages. The general opinion is that Dacian was a satem language, as was Thracian.;

Balkan linguistic union
While most of Romanian grammar and morphology are based on Vulgar Latin, there are some features that are shared only with other languages of the Balkans and not found in other Romance languages. The languages of the Balkan linguistic union belong to individual branches of the Indo-European language family: Bulgarian and Albanian, and in some cases Greek and Serbian. The shared features include a suffixed definite article, the syncretism of genitive and dative case, the formation of the future and perfect tenses, and the lack of infinitives.

Slavic languages
The Slavic influence was primarily due to the migration of Slavic tribes who traversed the territory of present-day Romania during the early evolution of the language. It is interesting to note that Slavs were assimilated north of the Danube, whereas they almost completely assimilated the Romanized population (Vlachs) living south of Danube. An important part of this population was still Vlach in the 10th century, only to fade away along with Vlach political power. The other surrounding languages (all Slavic, with the exception of Hungarian) also influenced Romanian, through centuries of interaction.

Of great importance was the influence of Old Church Slavonic, as it was the liturgical language of the Romanian Orthodox Church (compared to western and central European countries which used Latin) from the Middle Ages, until the 18th century. However, Latin held an important position in Transylvania during the Middle Ages, a part of the western-styled feudal Kingdom of Hungary at that moment. Liturgical Romanian was first officially used there after the union of the Romanian Orthodox Church in Transylvania with Rome,;[http://www.formula-as.ro/reviste_592__44__p.s.-florentin-crihalmeanu.html P.S. Florentin Crihălmeanu in &quot;Formula AS&quot;]: ''După unirea cu Roma, “boscorodirea”, specifică epocii de dominaţie slavonă, va fi înlocuită cu slujba în limba română (curăţată pe cât posibil de impurităţile slavone, prin osârdia extraordinară a latiniştilor Şcolii Ardelene).''; giving birth to the Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanian Greek-Catholic Church in 1698 ;http://www.bru.ro/istorie/madrid.asp?id=cap22c History of the Romanian Church United with Rome]; (the most numerous church in Transylvania until the World War II ;The census in 1930 recorded a Greek-Catholic relative majority (31,1% of the population), whereas Orthodox Church came only second (27,8% of the population).;). This caused Romanian to lose many of its borrowings form Slavonic as the first standardisation of it (among others the switch to the Latin alphabet) was done by Şcoala Ardeleană, founded in Transylvania.;

Borrowings from Old Church Slavonic include:

In the 20th century, an increasing number of English words have been borrowed (such as: ''gem'' ; [kj] (Lat. clarus >; Rom. chiar, Ital. chiaro) and also a few with Dalmatian, such as /gn/ (probably phonetically [ŋn]) >; [mn] (Lat. cognatus >; Rom. cumnat, Dalm. comnut).

Among the notable phonetic changes are:
* diphthongization of e and o
* : Lat. cera >; Rom. ceară (wax)
* : Lat. sole >; Rom. soare (sun)
* iotacism [e] → [ie] in the beginning of the word
* : Lat. herba >; Rom. iarbă (grass, herb)
* velar [k], [g] → labial [p], [b], [m] before alveolar consonants:
* : Lat. octo >; Rom. opt (eight)
* : Lat. quattuor >; Rom. patru (four)
* : Lat. lingua >; Rom. limbă (tongue, language)
* : Lat. signum >; Rom. semn (sign)
* : Lat. coxa >; Rom. coapsă (thigh)
* rotacism [l] → [r] between vowels
* : Lat. caelum >; Rom. cer (sky)
* Alveolars [d] and [t] palatalized to [dz]/[z] and [ts] when before short [e] or long [i]
* : Lat. deus >; Rom. zeu (god)
* : Lat. tenem >; Rom. ţine (hold)

On the other hand, it (along with French) has ''lost'' the /kw/ (qu) sound from original Latin, turning it either into p (''patru'', &quot;four&quot;; cf. It. ''quattro'') or a hard or soft c (''când'', &quot;when&quot;; ''calitate'', &quot;quality&quot;).

Writing system
Neacşu's letter is the oldest surviving document written in Romanian

The first written record of a Romanic language spoken in the Middle Ages in the Balkans was written by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes Confessor in the 6th century about a military expedition against the Avars from 587, when a Vlach muleteer accompanying the Byzantine army noticed that the load was falling from one of the animals and shouted to a companion ''Torna, torna fratre'' (meaning &quot;Return, return brother!&quot;).
A sample of the Romanian, written in the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet, which was still in use in the early 19th century

The oldest written text in Romanian is a letter from late June 1521, in which Neacşu of Câmpulung wrote to the mayor of Braşov about an imminent attack of the Turks. It was written using the Cyrillic alphabet, like most early Romanian writings. The earliest writing in Latin script was a late 16th century Transylvanian text which was written with the Hungarian alphabet conventions.

In the late 1700s, Transylvanian scholars noted the Latin origin of Romanian and adapted the Latin alphabet to the Romanian language, using some rules from Italian, recognized as Romanian's closest relative. The Cyrillic alphabet remained in (gradually decreasing) use until 1860, when Romanian writing was first officially regulated.

In the Soviet Republic of Moldova, a special version of the Cyrillic alphabet derived from the Russian version was used, until 1989, when it returned to the Romanian Latin alphabet.

= Romanian alphabet=


The Romanian alphabet is as follows:

:A, a (a); Ă, ă (ă); Â, â (â din a); B, b (be), C, c (ce); D, d (de), E, e (e); F, f (fe / ef); G, g (ghe / ge); H, h (ha / haş); I, i (i); Î, î (î din i); J, j (je), K, k (ka de la kilogram), L, l (le / el); M, m (me / em); N, n (ne / en); O, o (o); P, p (pe); Q (chiu); R, r, (re / er); S, s (se / es); (e); T, t (te); (e); U, u (u); V, v (ve); W (dublu ve); X, x (ics); Y (i grec); Z, z (ze / zet).

K, Q, W and Y are not part of the native alphabet, were officially introduced in the Romanian alphabet in 1982 and are mostly used to write loanwoards like ''kilogram'', ''quasar'', ''watt'', and ''yoga''.

The Romanian alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet, and has five additional letters (these are not diacriticals, but letters in their own right). Initially, there were as many as 12 additional letters, but some of them disappeared in subsequent reforms. Also, until the early 20th century, a short vowel marker was used.

Today, the Romanian alphabet is largely phonemic. However, the letters &quot;â&quot; (used inside the words) and &quot;î&quot; (used at the beginning or the end; it can also be used in the middle of a composite word) both represent the same close central unrounded vowel .

Another exception from a completely phonetic writing system is the fact that vowels and their respective semivowels are not distinguished in writing. In dictionaries the distinction is marked by separating the entry word into syllables for the words containing a hiatus that might be mispronounced as a diphthong or a triphthong.

Stressed vowels also are not marked in writing, except very rarely in cases where by misplacing the stress a word might change its meaning and if the meaning is not obvious from the context. For example ''trei copíi'' means &quot;three children&quot; while ''trei cópii'' means &quot;three copies&quot;.

=Reading rules=
Reading Romanian involves learning a few rules, quite similar to reading Italian.
* ''h'' is not silent like in other Romance languages such as Spanish and French, but represents the phoneme , except in the groups ''ch'' and ''gh'' (see below)
* ''j'' represents 
* There are two letters with a comma below,and , which represent the soundsand . However, the allographs with a cedilla instead of a comma, ''Ş'' and ''Ţ'', became widespread when pre-Unicode and early Unicode character sets did not include the standard form.
* A final orthographical ''i'' after a consonant often represents the palatalization of the consonant (e. g. ''lup''&quot;wolf&quot; vs. ''lupi''&quot;wolves&quot;).
* ''ă'' represents the schwa, .
* ''î'' and ''â'' represent .
* The letter ''e'' is generally pronounced as the diphthong ''ie''when it is in the beginning of a form of the verb ''a fi'' &quot;to be&quot;, e. g. ''este''&quot;is&quot;. This rule also applies to personal pronouns beginning with ''e'', e. g. ''el''&quot;he&quot;.
* ''x'' represents either the phonemeas in ''expresie'' = expression, oras in ''exemplu'' = example.
* Similarly to the reading rules in Italian, the letters ''c'' and ''g'' represent the affricatesandbefore ''i'' and ''e'', andandelsewhere. Whenandare followed by vowelsand(or their corresponding semivowels or the final ) the digraphs ''ch'' and ''gh'' are used instead of ''c'' and ''g'', as shown in the table below.

|}

=Punctuation and capitalization=
The main particularities Romanian has relative to other languages using the Latin alphabet are:
* The quotation marks use the Quotation mark, non-English usage#Quotation marks in Polish|Polish format in the format „quote «inside» quote”, that is, 99 down and 99 up for normal quotations, with the addition of non-French double angle quotes without space for inside quotation when necessary.
* Proper quotations which span multiple paragraphs don't start each paragraph with the quotation marks; one single pair of quotation marks is always used, regardless of how many paragraphs are quoted;
* Dialogues are identified with Quotation mark, non-English usage#Quotation dash|quotation dashes;
* The Oxford comma before &quot;and&quot; is considered incorrect (&quot;red, yellow and blue&quot; is the proper format);
* Punctuation signs which follow a text in parentheses always follow the final bracket;
* In titles, only the first letter of the first word is capitalized, the rest of the title using sentence capitalization (with all its rules: proper names are capitalized as usual, etc.).
* Names of months and days are not capitalized (''ianuarie'' &quot;January&quot;, ''joi'' &quot;Thursday&quot;)
* Adjectives derived from proper names are not capitalized (''Germania'' &quot;Germany&quot;, but ''german'' &quot;German&quot;)

Exceptions and trends
Usage of Polish or German quotation marks has decreased considerably in favor of the much more convenient English-language format, at least in informal messages. Even in writing, because of the awkwardness of properly drawing German dashes (reversing the direction of writing upwards for the final quotation symbol), the proper format is rarely used, typically using the Quotation mark, non-English usage#Polish|Polish format, if any attempt at proper formatting is done. In practice, only the most formal documents, such as literary works or very formal letters, use what are formally considered the proper form of quotation marks.

Language sample
English text:
: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
::''(Universal Declaration of Human Rights)''

Contemporary Romanian - highlighted words are French or Italian loanwords:
: Toate fiinţele umane se nasc libere şi egale în demnitate şi în drepturi. Ele sunt înzestrate cu raţiune şi conştiinţă şi trebuie să se comporte unele faţă de altele în spiritul fraternităţii.

Romanian, excluding French and Italian loanwords - highlighted words are Slavic loanwords:
: Toate fiinţele omeneşti se nasc slobode şi deopotrivă în destoinicie şi în drepturi. Ele sunt înzestrate cu înţelegere şi cuget şi trebuie să se poarte unele faţă de altele în duh de frăţietate.

Romanian, excluding loanwords:
: Toate fiinţele omeneşti se nasc nesupuse şi asemenea în preţuire şi în drepturi. Ele sunt înzestrate cu înţelegere şi cuget şi se cuvine să se poarte unele faţă de altele după firea frăţiei.
