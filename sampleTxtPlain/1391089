Sai Ying Pun is a proposed station on the Hong Kong MTRserving the neighbourhood of Sai Ying Pun in northwestern Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong.

Under the latest proposal as of June 2005, Sai Ying Pun will serve as a station on the proposed extension of the Island line known as West Island Line, as opposed to a transfer station to another line serving the Southern District with the same name as in previous plans.

The station appeared in ''Hong Kong Mass Transit: Further Studies'' in 1970. It was to be built as part of the Island Line in the 1980s, but construction of the line did not commence westwards beyond Sheung Wan, citing inadequate passengers and technical difficulties by contractors.

Proposed locations
In [http://www.ozp.tpb.gov.hk/pdf/S_H3_20_e.pdf Outline Zoning Plan No. S/H3/20], the Planning Department of the government has indicated one possible location under Des Voeux Road West at Ko Shing Street as of December 2003. A ventilation shaft marked with MTR notices can be found at the intersection. A large void facing Des Voeux Road West, sealed, can also be found at a nearby medical centre, which some have speculated that it was reserved for a to-be-built exit. These findings suggest that this was the original proposed location.

However, in [http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/extensions/WIL&amp;SIL_Summary.pdf#page=2 proposals submitted to the government] by the MTR in May 2002, the proposed station was shifted further west to the intersection of Des Voeux Road West and Water Street.

In March 2004, the MTR moved the station back east but south of the initial alignment under King George V Memorial Park. Source from MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) revealed to the local newspaper Ming Pao that this location was chosen to avoid any nuisance during works under major roads. The location would also better suit the needs of Mid-Levels residents, the source said.
