Interstate 355 (abbreviated I-355), also known as the Veterans Memorial Tollway, is an interstate highway and tollway in the western and southwest suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. Like other tollways in northeastern Illinois, it is run by the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA). I-355 runs from Interstate 80 in New Lenox north to Interstate 290 in Itasca,; a distance of .; The highway is six lanes wide for its entire length.;;

I-355 was opened in 1989 as the North-South Tollway to ease congestion on Illinois Route 53, a north-south two-lane state highway in central DuPage County. The highway, initially running from I-55 to I-290, cut travel times along the Schaumburg-Wheaton-Bolingbrook corridor. The opening of the tollway also opened the western suburbs of Chicago to commercial and industrial development.;

On November 11,&amp;nbsp;2007, a southern extension to I-355 opened from I-55 to I-80, a distance of ; on opening the southern extension, the highway was renamed to the Veterans Memorial Tollway. The extension was built through Will County and a small portion of Cook County, one of the fastest-growing regions in Illinois. ISTHA expects the extension to cut travel times in the region by 20 percent.;

History
= Early history=
From 1923 through 1963, the north-south transportation corridor including eastern portions of DuPage County was serviced via Rohlwing Road (also known as SBI Route 53,;; and later Illinois 53), a major north-south two-lane arterial that still exists in the county today.;; From 1963 to 1970, a new expressway was built north from Army Trail Road through Schaumburg to the Northwest Tollway (now the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway). When it was completed, Illinois 53 was moved onto this new expressway from Rohlwing Road.;;;;;;

The original alignment of I-355 was defined in the Chicago Area Transportation Study (abbreviated CATS) Transportation Plan of April&amp;nbsp;1962. The plan called for a supplemental system of limited-access expressways to be built in the Chicago metropolitan area by 1980, and defined corridors where the expressways were to be located. Of these corridors, the vast majority, including the Des Plaines River expressway, the Crosstown Expressway running north-south along the west side of Chicago, and most of a proposed northern extension of Illinois 53 ran into intense local opposition and were never built.;;

Initially, the state's plans for the limited access expressway south of Army Trail Road were for a freeway, similar to the existing freeway north of Army Trail Road. In 1979, Chicago mayor Jane Byrne canceled proposed plans for the Crosstown Expressway. DuPage County acquired the rights to half of the US$200&amp;nbsp;million (1979, US$568&amp;nbsp;million in 2007) that had been earmarked for the expressway. The $100&amp;nbsp;million (1979, $284&amp;nbsp;million in 2007) remaining was then earmarked for the new freeway to replace Illinois&amp;nbsp;53. However, this amount was found to be insufficient for construction. The project was then converted into a tollway, and the money spent on other projects in the county.;;

Construction of the new highway was not without its share of legal problems. In June&amp;nbsp;1984, Republican minority leader of the Illinois House of Representatives James &quot;Pate&quot; Philip helped push through legislation authorizing the construction of the tollway, then referred to as simply the DuPage Tollway.;; Officials at the Morton Arboretum, one of the nation's premier woodland research centers, promptly filed a federal lawsuit to block construction of the tollway. They also promised to prevent ISTHA from obtaining environmental approval from federal officials.;;

The conflict was resolved in late April of 1985, when the two agencies came to an agreement regarding construction of the new tollway. To protect the arboretum from salt spray and other pollutants caused by cars on the tollway, ISTHA agreed to build I-355 below grade around the perimeter of the arboretum. A water collection system would be built by the tollway to divert runoff from the arboretum. In addition, earthen berms would be built along the tollway to prevent salt spray from damaging arboretum plants, which had already been affected by salt spray from the then East-West Tollway, which itself wasaway. In exchange, the DuPage County Forest Preserve District agreed to a 99&amp;ndash;year lease providing 189&amp;nbsp;acres&amp;nbsp;(79.5&amp;nbsp;hectares) of its land to the arboretum for the development of an &quot;urban vegetation laboratory&quot;. Under the agreement, Morton Arboretum would charge DuPage County residents a lower prices for admission one day of the week, built a bicycle path connecting the arboretum to nearby forest preserves, and begin a joint clean-streams program to improve the water quality of DuPage County's lakes and streams.; In January 1986, the tollway paid out $2.5&amp;nbsp;million (1986, $4.7&amp;nbsp;million in 2007) to a trust fund as a part of the settlement to help finance the arboretum's new programs.;;

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a preliminary environmental impact statement on March 13, 1986. At a public hearing a month later, the report was strongly criticized by arboretum executives and Woodridge officials as &quot;fatally flawed&quot; and a repeat of tollway-provided research, including typographical errors. Opposition to the tollway also cited outdated and inaccurated data regarding wetlands replacement, salt dispersion, and the lack of compensation to residents for lowered property values.;; Concerns were somewhat alleviated when the tollway agreed to run the road below-grade at 75th&amp;nbsp;Street instead of as a 28-foot&amp;nbsp;(8.5&amp;nbsp;m) high elevated highway. The tollway agreed to spend an extra $1&amp;nbsp;million (1986, $2&amp;nbsp;million in 2007) on the redesigned elevation and interchange.;;

The Corps of Engineers issued a permit for the tollway on October 8,&amp;nbsp;1986, rejecting last-minute concerns by the Sierra Club to reroute the toll road around sections of Churchill prairie, between Glen Ellyn and Lombard. The permit allowed the first two earth moving contracts issued by the tollway authority to move foward.;; The total cost of building the firstof new pavement was $450&amp;nbsp;million (1987, $817&amp;nbsp;million in 2007). Of the total cost, $325&amp;nbsp;million (1987, $590&amp;nbsp;million in 2007) went to construction, $30&amp;nbsp;million (1987, $54&amp;nbsp;million in 2007) to alleviating environmental concerns, including moving and enlarging 117&amp;nbsp;acres&amp;nbsp;(47.3&amp;nbsp;hectares) of wetlands, and $30&amp;nbsp;million (1987, $54&amp;nbsp;million in 2007) to utility relocation. Work in 1987 consisted primarily of excavation, embankment building and land acquisition.;;

By April&amp;nbsp;1988, the expressway was into its second year of construction. Because the tollway was experiencing problems with pavement on other roads in the system and anticipating heavy traffic on the new Interstate, the Tollway Authority decided to pave I-355 with pavement expected to last 20&amp;nbsp;years. The concrete on the tollway wasthick and ansub-base. The new pavement also incorporated fly ash and less cement, allowing the pavement to achieve maximum strength faster than pure concrete.;;

Governor James R. Thompson and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner dedicated the tollway on December 22,&amp;nbsp;1989. At the time it was opened, officials estimated travel times from Schaumburg to Oak Brook would be reduced from 55&amp;nbsp;minutes to 34&amp;nbsp;minutes, and from Wheaton to Darien from 60 to 34&amp;nbsp;minutes. Tollway officials also estimated that 200,000&amp;nbsp;cars per day would use I-355.;; This figure has since been shown to be slightly optimistic, with maximum average daily traffic values approaching 170,200 only at the northern end of the Interstate. The initial length of I-355 wasfrom I-55 north to I-290.;;

= Opening=
I-355 opened at the stroke of midnight on December 24,&amp;nbsp;1989. As a Christmas &quot;gift,&quot; the first two days of operation were free.; Due to lower traffic counts at the north and south ends of the highway and lack of construction money, the road was built with four lanes from Illinois Route 64 (North Avenue) to Interstate 88 (Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway) on the north end, and around I-55 on the south end. As early as 1991, tollway officials had drawn up plans to widen the highway to three lanes in each direction.;; Widening from North Avenue (Illinois Route 64) to Butterfield Road (Illinois Route 56) took place in 1995.;; The old lines marking the former shoulder can still be seen in the right lane as a result of the Tollway Authority's attempt to grind them away.

After the tollway opened, congestion decreased considerably on nearby north-south arteries. The DuPage County Division of Transportation calculated that congestion had decreased on Illinois&amp;nbsp;53 by 20%, and the volume of cars on nearby north-south roads Illinois&amp;nbsp;53, Illinois&amp;nbsp;59 and Illinois&amp;nbsp;83 had decreased. On Illinois&amp;nbsp;53 between Ogden Avenue and Roosevelt Road, traffic counts sank from 21,400 to 11,800&amp;nbsp;vehicles per day. In addition, traffic on the exit ramp from Interstate 294 (Tri-State Tollway) to I-55 dropped 10% in 12&amp;nbsp;months. Drivers also reported decreases in travel time from one end of the county to the other of up to 40&amp;nbsp;minutes.;;;;However, the opening of the tollway also greatly increased congestion on I-290 near the northern terminus. A construction project in the summer months of 1990 widened I-290 just north of the tollway, at a cost of $2&amp;nbsp;million to $2.5&amp;nbsp;million (1990, $3&amp;nbsp; to $&amp;nbsp;million in 2007).;

In spite of the apparent success of the tollway opening, traffic counts and projected toll revenues were initially lower than projected, with an estimated 65,000&amp;nbsp;motorists per day traveling along the tollway, generating $55,000 to $65,000 (1990, $87,000 to $103,000 in 2007) in daily toll revenues. In addition, a spate of lawsuits were filed regarding the payment of contractors and subcontractors. Numerous liens filed by subcontractors against the tollway were settled in June at a cost of $10.1&amp;nbsp;million. (1990, $15.9&amp;nbsp;million in 2007);;;; The tollway authority released an additional $1&amp;nbsp;million (1992) in May of 1992 to further settle claims made by the general contractor, entering arbitration soon afterwards to settle another $1.6&amp;nbsp;million to $27&amp;nbsp;million (1992, $2.5&amp;nbsp;million to $43&amp;nbsp;million in 2007) the contractor claimed it was owed.;; By 2005, average annual daily traffic values had risen to a range of 77,400 to 170,200&amp;nbsp;vehicles per day.;

As one of the newer tollways in the system, the Veterans Memorial Tollway has also seen considerable toll-collection related improvements earlier than the other tollways. I-PASS, the tollway system's electronic payment method, was tested on the entire stretch of I-355 in 1993 at various tollbooths; by September&amp;nbsp;1994, every plaza on I-355 accepted I-PASS.;; By 1998, the toll barriers were remodeled to have dedicated I-PASS lanes (lanes specifically set aside for electronic toll collections) installed.;; In 1999, it became the first tollway to receive I-PASS Express Lanes (also known as open road tolling, or ORT). With the installation of the express lanes, vehicles with I-PASS could be tolled at highway speeds of .;; In 2005, the express lanes were widened from two lanes to three lanes in each direction. This allowed the number of express lanes to match the number of travel lanes on the tollway.;;

Unlike all the other tollways in the tollway system, no oases were constructed on the Veterans Memorial Tollway. This is primarily due to the widespread access to food and fuel throughout the western suburbs when construction began in the late&amp;nbsp;1980s.; Via an interview/response through the Daily Herald.; When the southern extension was opened in Will County in 2007, that segment of road also did not have any oases.

In addition to the original alignment of I-355, the Transportation Plan of April&amp;nbsp;1962 included the concept of a route that ran from Bolingbrook south to Joliet. After the northern portion of I-355 opened in 1989, the Illinois General Assembly authorized the tollway authority to begin studying the southern extension of I-355.;;

The discovery of the Hine's Emerald Dragonfly, an endangered species, and related concerns for the environmental health of the Des Plaines River wetlands in 1995, ignited a series of legal challenges that delayed construction of the I-355 extension for several years. The Sierra Club filed a lawsuit in 1996 to block planning of the southern extension. In January&amp;nbsp;1997, a federal judge sided with the Sierra Club, halting construction of the southern extension while the state appealed. In 1999, the state dropped its appeal and amended the environmental impact study (EIS) to meet the Sierra Club's concerns.; The supplemental EIS was released in 2000, and in 2002 the FHWA issued a Record of Decision, allowing construction of the tollway to proceed after six years of delays. Land acquisition and utility relocation took place in 2004. Governor Rod Blagojevich's $5.6&amp;nbsp;billion Congestion-Relief Program for the Illinois Tollway was passed in September&amp;nbsp;2004, with $729.3&amp;nbsp;million being set aside for the extension.;; Bidding on an excavation contract passed on November 18,&amp;nbsp;2004 with construction beginning several days later.;; 

To document and reduce the impact of construction on the dragonfly's habitat, construction crews agreed to keep carcasses of any dragonfly kills. In addition, separate habitats for the dragonfly were developed near the Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve in Lemont and in two other preserves in Cook and Will counties.;; In late 2005, construction began on the roadway of thelong southern extension of I-355 from I-55 in Bolingbrook to I-80 in New Lenox.;;

Another controversy erupted in February&amp;nbsp;2006, when the Tollway Authority threatened to build the tollway with no interchanges unless the suburbs through which the new extension ran contributed $20&amp;nbsp;million for construction of the interchanges. This was the first time that the Tollway Authority had required local municipalities to contribute funds for interchange construction.;; The towns of Homer Glen, Lemont, New Lenox, Lockport and Will County agreed in a June 2006 intergovernmental agreement to provide $20&amp;nbsp;million in both cash and in-kind contributions for the interchanges.;;

The southern extension is expected to become an economic catalyst for municipalities located along the tollway. The village of New Lenox estimates that it will receive an additional $12&amp;nbsp;million in sales taxes after its two malls are built out. In Lockport, new Home Depot and SuperTarget stores are planned for the areas near 159th&amp;nbsp;Street and I-355. Large warehouse facilities are also being developed in areas near the Lockport interchanges.;;

One of &quot;the most impressive engineering feats on the state's 274 miles of toll roads&quot;; is the Des Plaines River Valley Bridge, a bridge over the Des Plaines River, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, the Illinois and Michigan Canal, Bluff Road, New Avenue, numerous railroads, and a major Commonwealth Edison utility corridor. The bridge islong, and constituted $125&amp;nbsp;million of the cost. Work on the bridge included the construction of 34&amp;nbsp;piers and elevation of existing high-voltage electricity lines to accommodate the highway.; To limit the number of piers in the valley, the bridge was built with bothpre-stressed bulb tee girders andpost-tensioned segmental concrete girders. This was $12&amp;nbsp;million less expensive than the concrete box girder design option, and $50&amp;nbsp;million less expensive than the steel plate girder design option. A design-build clause in the original contract for the bridge, in addition to success in the design-build contracts on the Tri-State Tollway widening and reconstruction, allowed project managers to redesign and build the new bridge.;;

A ribbon cutting and dedication ceremony was held on Veterans Day,&amp;nbsp;2007 (November 11,&amp;nbsp;2007), when the entire length of I-355 was officially renamed the Veterans Memorial Tollway.;; Ceremonies were held on the tollway near the 127th Street interchange in Lemont, at 147th Street in Homer Glen, and at U.S. Route 6 in New Lenox. In addition to the dedication, the day's activities included a Charity Walk/Run/Roll and &quot;Roll the Tollway,&quot; a charity pre-opening bicycle ride on the highway's south extension.;; After noting the success of the festival, ISTHA announced plans to repeat the event annually, including the closure of the entire southern extension.;; A tollway authority spokesman later clarified the tollway's position, indicating that while the extension would probably not be closed in its entirety in the future, a possibleride across the Des Plaines River Valley Bridge was an option.;; At around 10:00&amp;nbsp;pm&amp;nbsp;CST on November&amp;nbsp;11, a group of Illinois State Police vehicles and tollway maintenance vehicles escorted the first motorists southbound along the I-355 extension, stopping at each interchange to remove barricades. By the time the maintenance crews began to remove barricades along the northbound lanes of the extension, a group of 50 to 60&amp;nbsp;vehicles had gathered behind the crews.;;

As part of constructing the southern extension, awide corridor was donated to local municipalities for the construction of a multi-use trail that will run along most of the length of the tollway from I-80 to I-55. Completion of the trail is expected to cost $10&amp;nbsp;million, with funding to be provided by local communities along the path. A new construction fund for the trail was created from registration fees collected for &quot;Roll the Tollway.&quot;;;

Route description
The southern terminus of I-355 is northeast of New Lenox, where the highway intersects I-80. I-355 is routed north and slightly west through rural, hilly portions of Will County. Just after the U.S. Route 6 interchange (mile 1.0), tollway drivers pay a toll at Spring Creek Toll Plaza, the only toll plaza on the southern extension of I-355. It continues north through the rural sections of Will County, having exits that serve the towns of Homer Glen and Lockport. At 135th Street in Lemont, Interstate 355 briefly enters Cook County. After an interchange at 127th Street (mile 9.0), I-355 crosses over the Des Plaines River on the Des Plaines River Valley Bridge before returning to Will County. Shortly north of the bridge, I-355 intersects I-55 at Bolingbrook. Multiple flyover ramps connect all directions of both highways.;

North of I-55, I-355 continues to run almost due north through the established western suburbs of Chicago in DuPage County. Travelers pay another toll just north of Boughton Road, at the Boughton Road Toll Plaza. Continuing north, I-355 has another multiple flyover interchange with I-88, commonly called the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway. On the southern end of the interchange, northbound I-355 has exits to both directions of I-88. I-355 then swings below I-88 and runs side-by-side with the other tollway for . Southbound exits to both directions of I-88 are at the northern end of the interchange. At the Army Trail Road Toll Plaza, through traffic pays the last toll of the tollway. I-355 has no tolls north of the Army Trail Road exit (mile 30) in Addison. There is one untolled exit (mile 31.5) at U.S. Route 20 (Lake Street) north of the tollway. I-355 terminates at the I-290 interchange near the border of the villages of Itasca and Addison.;

The northernmost two toll plazas (Boughton Road and Army Trail Road) charge $1.00 cash and $0.50 for cars with I-PASS and E-ZPass. The Spring Creek Toll Plaza charges $2.00 for cash and $1.00 for I-PASS and E-ZPass.; (PDF).; All three toll plazas force traffic paying with cash to exit right into an area, separate from the dedicated I-PASS lanes. Drivers paying with cash then pay their tolls at manned plaza tollbooths.;; I-PASS and E-ZPass equipped cars and trucks are permitted to stay on the mainline and pay tolls at highway speeds in the tollway's Open Road Tolling lanes.;;

On I-355, the only control cities that are actual cities are Joliet and St. Louis, Missouri (the latter mentioned once southbound just before Army Trail Road).;; Other control cities on I-355 are limited to general areas of suburban Chicago. For example, control cities for I-355 while on I-55 are &quot;West Suburbs&quot; and &quot;Southwest Suburbs&quot;. The control city for areas north of I-88 are &quot;Northwest Suburbs&quot;.;

Current Construction
Due to increasing congestion, the Veterans Tollway is being widening to four lanes between 75th Street and Interstate 88 in 2008-2009. This constuction was added to the Tollway's Congestion Relief Plan in mid 2007.;;

Long Term Plans
There is talk of extending Interstate 355 past its current Southern Terminus at Interstate 80 all the way to Interstate 57, and possibly connect to the proposed Illiana Expressway. No formal plans currently exist. The Tollway, along with IDOT and other regional planning agencies, has begun studying the feasibility of numerous future toll roads in the Chicago Area (including the extension to I-57).;;
