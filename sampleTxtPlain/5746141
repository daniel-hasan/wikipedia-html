Swiftfox is a freely downloadable, proprietary graphical web browser.Swiftfox is a build of the open source Mozilla Firefox web browser for Linux made by Jason Halme.Not all Firefox extensions and plugins are fully compatible with Swiftfox. The name Swiftfox comes from the animal Swift Fox. 

Optimization
Swiftfox is optimized using the following methods:

Binary code optimization
*Compiled with the highest level of compiler optimization, rather than optimization for binary size.
** Swiftfox is compiled -O3,;;;Using url of ''about:buildconfig'' to check the details of the 2.0 builds; (the highest level)
***The resulting Swiftfox binary is larger than Firefox. It should be noted that -O3 is not necessarily faster than -O1, -O2, or -Os as many factors such as the CPU's cache and overall design. On certain architectures -Os is significantly faster than -O3, specifically old computers.
**Firefox is compiled -Os;Using url of ''about:buildconfig'' to check the details of the 2.0 builds;(which is for binary size;;).
*Binaries incorporate additional instruction sets.;;
** Intel and AMD: SSE2, SSE, MMX, (not generally SSE3;;).
** AMD only: 3DNow!
*Optimization specific to the build microprocessor architecture.;;
** Intel: Pentium 4, Pentium 3, Pentium M, Pentium 3M, Pentium 2, Pentium 4#Prescott|Prescott.
** AMD64: Athlon64 (32bit binary).
** AMD: Athlon XP, Athlon, K6-2.
*Compiled with newer version of GCC (Firefox 2.0 uses 3.3.2, Swiftfox 2.0 uses 4.0.4).;Using url of ''about:buildconfig'' to check the details of the 2.0 builds;
Increased Security
*Better protection from Buffer overflow attacks;; (Swiftfox 2.0 uses -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2; Firefox 2.0 uses gcc 3.x, which does not support this).;Using url of ''about:buildconfig'' to check the details of the 2.0 builds;
Simplify
*Pango is not included in the build . This means that Unicode fonts remain supported (see Unicode and HTML), but without certain extra features;; provided by Pango. This simplification reduces the binary size, and reduces rendering.
Changed default preference values
*IPv6 DNS lookups are disabled.;;;; preventing slowdowns experienced;;
*HTTP pipelining is enabled by default.;;;; Note that Fasterfox provides a GUI to adjust these settings.
*For full details, see [http://getswiftfox.com/source/swiftfox-1.8branch.patch].

Speed
;
= Firefox speed=
Firefox has been criticised for slow startup compared with other browsers ;;, a criticism confirmed by pre-Firefox 2.0 speed tests.;;;; A speed comparison of various Linux (and other) browsers has been done.;;

= Swiftfox speed=
A superficial test done by APC Magazine, exhibits a slightly faster startup time together with a 1.7% webpage rendering speedup has been reported on the 1.5.0.6 version.;; The details of this test are a page rendering in 4.79 seconds for Firefox and 4.67 seconds for Swiftfox, both 32bit on 64bit system. A caveat in this test was that there was no benchmarking on different processors, so builds optimized for different processors were not evaluated, nor discussed.

Additional options
Swiftfox is bundled with the following freely available Firefox plugins and extensions: 
*XForms extension is installed and enabled
*libunixprintplugin.so plugin is installed

Downloads available	 
*The latest released version of Firefox 2.0 - separate builds are available for each processor type covering Intel and AMD processors:
** packaged as a tar file
** packaged for Debian installs that can't be redistributed by Debian because of the Swiftfox license restricts redistribution.;;;;
*Recent snapshots of development versions of Firefox 2.0 and 3.0 (trunk) - separate builds for AMD Athlon XP processors and Intel Pentium 4 (and compatible).

License
The same as Firefox, the Swiftfox source code is open source, with the source code under MPL 1.1 except for parts relating to branding.;
Unlike Firefox, the Swiftfox binaries have a proprietary license;; which does not allow redistribution. According to the author, this is to prevent the possibility of any confusion with tainted versions (see the Firefox branding argument Mozilla Firefox#Trademark and logo issues). The name Swiftfox is trademarked by Jason Halme, and accordingly can not be used on other 3rd party Firefox builds without his permission.

The open source compliance of Swiftfox has been a questioned by some;;, as the MPL requires source code for custom binary distributions to be distributed and specifically licensed under the MPL, GPL, or LGPL. Further all source code changes, including changes related to branding, must be distributed. To date, the Swiftfox developer has released only changes to default Firefox system settings.

= Debian=
Swiftfox is offered in the form of [http://getswiftfox.com/debian.htm Debian packages] in the Debian section at the official site. The repository offered by the site is listed as non-free in the Debian sense, as its URL, &quot;deb ;http://getswiftfox.com/builds/debian; unstable non-free&quot;, is appended with the words 'non-free'. Another reason Swiftfox hosts its own repositories is that the Swiftfox license restricts redistribution of its binaries.;; This license also restricts use of the name Swiftfox and its corresponding branding.; The license effectively stops Debian and other Linux distributions from having Swiftfox available as part of a distribution and from including it in a distribution's package repository.;;

Alternatives
* Firefox source code and Swiftfox changes are freely available for download, allowing anyone to create their own build.
* Swiftweasel is an optimized build of the Mozilla Firefox code that is licensed under the MPL 1.1.
