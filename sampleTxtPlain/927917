 is a 26-episode anime television series produced in 2004 by the Bee Train animation studio. K≈çichi Mashimo directed ''Madlax'' and the soundtrack was composed by Yuki Kajiura. The DVD version was released in North America and the United Kingdom by ADV Films, and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. As of November 2006, the series airs on the Anime Network channel. According to the director Mashimo, the title is a portmanteau of two English words: ''wiktionary:mad|MAD'' and ''wiktionary:relax|reLAXed'', mirroring the authors' intention to portray the two extremes of human being.;; Mashimo used to portray the duality of human nature he was going for with the themes of the show. [...] Looking past the metaphysical pondering that was the main way in which this show deviated from ''Noir'', there was a tightly scripted story that took a lengthy time getting to where it was going but it did so in such a satisfying manner that I honestly can't imagine anyone interested in the genre finding fault with it.}};

The story revolves around two young women who seemingly have little in common and do not know of the other's existence, at first. The titular Madlax is a legend amongst the mercenaries and assassins of the fictional civil war-torn country of Gazth-Sonika. &quot;Madlax&quot; is a code name and a substitute for her real one, forgotten along with the rest of her past before 1999, when the war started. The other protagonist is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy aristocratic family in the peaceful European country of Nafrece.Twelve years before the story begins, an airliner her mother and she were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret's father who lead the rescuers, have been missing ever since. Margaret managed to travel back to Nafrece on her own, though how she made it remains a mystery considering that she too has lost her memories prior to her return; the only thing she recalls is a single word, &quot;Madlax&quot;.With this thread linking the two girls, they both independently start investigating the powerful crime syndicate Enfant and its enigmatic mastermind who, for some reason, shows interest in both of them. 

Multiple similarities between ''Madlax'' and ''Noir'', an earlier work by Bee Train, have been pointed out.;;;; According to the authors, these two series are the first installments of a trilogy exploring the so-called girls-with-guns genre,;;;See also the article about the [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Girls-with-guns girls-with-guns] on ''Bee Train Fan Wiki''.; with the third title being ''El Cazador de la Bruja''.; installment in a series of what Director Koichi Mashimo has referred to as his girls-with-guns genre trilogy.}}; Still, ''Madlax'' differs considerably from its predecessor in its less episodic and more plot-driven style.;;In particular contrast to the predominantly realistic ''Noir'', ''Madlax'' incorporates many supernatural aspects and concepts associated with psychological thrillers and surrealism, which the audience must often interpret without further explanation.;;;;;;;

Story
= Characters=
Clockwise from top-left: Vanessa, Madlax, Margaret, Elenore, Carrossea, Monday, and Limelda

''Madlax'' features a large cast of distinctive characters which, according to the composer Yuki Kajiura, serve as the milestones forinner growth, one of the main topics of the show (see #Themes|Themes of ''Madlax'').;; At the beginning, Margaret is a sleepy, clumsy amnesiac, who lives under the care of her devoted and sometimes overprotective maidservant , a child prodigy who graduated from school years ahead of other students to spend all her time caring for her &quot;Miss&quot;. Elenore helps keep the absent-minded and alienated Margaret out of trouble, which Margaret seems able to find even in tranquil Nafrece.;''Madlax'', episode 6 ([http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/5309.php summary]).; Also caring for her is , a soft-spoken but strong-minded corporate executive in her early thirties; who was once her tutor.;Elenore: &quot;Miss Vanessa, as her tutor you gave her culture and education. Thanks to you, since then she's come so far that she can lead a normal school life&quot;. ''Madlax'', episode 6 (9:44).;

It is also Vanessa who links Margaret to the other female lead in the second half of the series &amp;mdash; , a beautiful and kind young woman who happens to be the most efficient operative and assassin in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika.;Galza Lieutenant: &quot;What'll be a big deal is when THAT one shows up. [...] A super-skilled agent named Ma...&quot; ''Madlax'', episode 1 (3:23).; When Vanessa travels to Gazth-Sonika, she hires Madlax as her bodyguard. Just like Margaret, Madlax remembers next to nothing of her life before twelve years ago, except the word that she accepted as her code name and a vague image of her father, whom she hopes to meet one day. Madlax's supernatural battle skills prove increasingly useful when Vanessa's investigation of the Gazth-Sonikan casus belli, which until then had been unjustly thought to be her own father's diplomatical incompetence,;Vanessa: &quot;My father was a diplomat in Nafrece, you see, and at the time that the threat of civil war here was coming to a peak, he was in charge of relations with Gazth-Sonika. Then the civil war broke out, and my parents were detained by the Gazth-Sonika army under suspicion of inciting the war&quot;. ''Madlax'', episode 13 (8:21).; draws the attention of a powerful criminal intelligence network named &quot;Enfant&quot; () to them.

The mysterious masked head of Enfant, known as , is shown single-handedly controlling all information channels on the planet;List of Madlax characters#Maclay Marini|Maclay Marini's investigation of Enfant and its consequences. ''Madlax'', episode 4.; and commanding an army of agents to pursue his obscure goals that involve, among others, Margaret and Madlax. One of these agents is his right-hand manwho often plays his own game under Monday's nose. Carrossea attempts to gain the trust of Margaret Burton, whom he is assigned to observe, yet he also feels himself mysteriously drawn to her. Another agent of Enfant in the series is , an officer of the Gazth-Sonikan royal guard and excellent sniper who develops a bitter rivalry with Madlax.

= Plot summary=

The first half of the series alternates between the two leads.Madlax works as a special ops agent for hire in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika, while Margaret enjoys the tranquility of Nafrece, a country apparently styled after France.;''Madlax'', episode 14: The Eiffel Tower can be observed at approx. 6:25.; When a &quot;picture book&quot;, presumably given to Margaret by her late father, attracts the attention of international crime syndicate Enfant, she starts researching the book's origins and discovers that they lie in Gazth-Sonika. Enfant's top operative, Carrossea Doon, tracks Margaret down but tips off his superiors in the wrong direction &amp;mdash; towards Madlax, who has been causing Enfant trouble in Gazth-Sonika for some time. Meanwhile, Vanessa Rene, Margaret's former tutor, discovers that her employer, Bookwald Industries, covertly supports the civil war in Gazth-Sonika by supplying both sides with firearms and decides to find more about the true cause of the war. Her investigation brings her to Gazth-Sonika, where Madlax is assigned as her bodyguard, and together, they uncover data that proves that Enfant orchestrated the entire conflict. Enfant intercepts and forces them into hiding. Back in Nafrece, Margaret decides to travel to Gazth-Sonika to help Vanessa and is accompanied by both her maidservant Elenore Baker and Carrossea Doon. 

Eventually, Madlax and Margaret encounter each other and embark on a search for List of Madlax characters#Quanzitta Marison|Quanzitta Marison, a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who is suggested to know about Margaret's book, Enfant's involvement with it, and Enfant itself. Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Friday Monday (Enfant's leader) possesses supernatural powers connected to the Fictional setting of Madlax#Holy Books|three ancient books, one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he in fact died 12 years ago, and held on to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret. Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to complete his own goals. 

Three personae of Margaret Burton

While Margaret and Carrossea perform the ritual, Madlax is attacked by her arch-nemesis throughout the show, Limelda Jorg. Limelda accidentally kills Vanessa while targeting Madlax, sending the latter into clinical depression. Elenore and Lady Quanzitta's servant List of Madlax characters#Nakhl|Nakhl manage to restore Madlax's will to live and persuade her to save Margaret, and the three storm Enfant's headquarters together. During the assault, Elenore is killed and Margaret, now under Monday's control, shoots Madlax. Believing her to be dead, Monday commences a ritual to unleash people's inhibitions and trigger worldwide anarchy; but Margaret's memories return and she snaps out of his mind control. Only now does the audience learn the truth: back in 1999, Monday drove Margaret's father insane with his powers and she was forced to kill her own parent. To escape the horrible truth of her patricide, Margaret split herself into three personae: the &quot;memory keeper&quot; List of Madlax characters#Laetitia|Laetitia, the sinful Madlax, and the innocent Margaret herself. After the revelation, Madlax reappears and guns down Monday, followed by Margaret fusing the three personae to undo the ritual she previously performed with Monday, saving the world from insanity. Upon accomplishing that, she once again splits herself in three, judging that after twelve years, she no longer has the right to make decisions for her other personae.

''Madlax'', episode 26 (16:56).; In the end, Margaret draws the conclusion that the world and everyone living in it carry both good and evil within them and are free to embrace either side.;

Madlax and Vanessa

''Madlax'' has gained fame among the shoujo-ai fandom for its implied lesbian content.;;;; The main source of such speculations in the series is the relationship between Madlax, Vanessa Rene and Limelda Jorg,;;;Limelda confesses her love for Madlax.

According to the director K≈çichi Mashimo, he has always envisioned ''Noir'' and ''Madlax'' as part of a trilogy belonging to the girls-with-guns genre,; and soon after the release of the latter, he revealed that the third installment was already being planned (later revealed to be ''El Cazador de la Bruja'').; In late 2002, Mashimo invited Shigeru Kitayama, the producer of ''Noir'' who once came up with its original idea, to discuss a new series entitled ''Madlax''. Kitayama greatly expanded Mashimo's original screenplay plan, but it was not until Y≈çsuke Kuroda was put in charge of the script that the series took its final appearance. It took Kuroda around one year to finish the screenplays for all 26 episodes, during which he was constantly encouraged by Mashimo to add his own original ideas to their initial plan. Kuroda has admitted that at the time he received Mashimo's invitation, he felt frustrated after his first project has been canceled by the publisher, so he decided to make ''Madlax'' &quot;really extravagant&quot;, blending as many genres at once as he could. K≈çichi Mashimo, furthermore, admitted that the most unusual plot twists, like Margaret and Madlax's connection to each other, were invented by Kuroda and him while drunk.;

By comparison with ''Noir'', ''Madlax'' features a much larger primary cast, including multiple recurring male characters, an element nearly absent in the former. It was not so in the original screenplay draft written by Mashimo and Kitayama: for example, &quot;Madlax&quot; was Margaret's own nickname and List of Madlax characters#Charlie|Charlie (Vanessa's colleague at Bookwald Industries) had one of the central roles similar to Speedy's in ''Avenger''. Only the &quot;draft&quot; characters' names remained of them when Kuroda has rewritten the script. A total of three character designers collaborated on ''Madlax'' cast: Satoshi Ohsawa (who also worked on ''Noir'' cast) created the central heroines Margaret and Madlax; Minako Shiba drew the agents of Enfant led by Friday Monday and Carrossea Doon; and Satoko Miyachi was entrusted with the &quot;mysterious&quot; characters, Laetitia and Poupee.; Kuroda)''|publisher=ADV Films|location=Houston, Texas|publisherid=DMAD/001|year=2005}};;;;

Seiy≈´s who voiced characters in ''Madlax'' have participated in earlier projects by studio Bee Train, for example, Houko Kuwashima and Aya Hisakawa who played Kirika Yuumura and Chloe in ''Noir'' also voiced Margaret Burton and Limelda Jorg.;;;; Kotono Mitsuishi (Mireille Bouquet in ''Noir''), on the other hand, has received only a minor role (Margaret's mother in episode 21),;; while the titular lead of ''Madlax'' was voiced by Sanae Kobayashi, previously involved with ''.hack//Liminality'' (Mai Minase).;; Masashi Ebara (Friday Monday) also had a major role in ''Liminality'' (Junichiro Tokuoka).;; Monica Rial (Kirika Yuumura in the English translation of ''Noir'') worked on the translation of the screenplay for the ADV Films release,;; which earned praise from the critics.;;

Originally, ''Madlax'' was broadcast in Japan by TV Tokyo from 5 April to 27 September 2004, from 1:30 to 2:00 a.m. every Tuesday (formally, Monday night).;; Shortly before the series finished airing, it has been licensed in North America and Europe by ADV Films,;; which has previously acquired distribution rights for ''Noir'' and has long had plans to license its successor, as well.;; The official English dub has been released under the trademark ''MADLAX'' on a total of seven DVDs from 12 April 2005 to 28 March 2006 and received a TV-14 television rating system#United States|rating, though it has been lowered to TV-PG for the consequent cable network broadcast.;. Retrieved on 2006-10-29.; ''Madlax'' has become the first series on which ADV Films' director and producer David Williams tested the technology of distributing promotional materials via Peer-to-peer|P2P network BitTorrent.;;

The North-American DVD release contains extras available in English only, such the controversial ''Conversations with SSS'';;;;; and ''Sock Puppet Theater'', an Easter egg live action about Madlax going after Chris Patton, List of Madlax characters#Badgis|Badgis' voice actor and an annoying womanizer (accessible during the second transition of episode 21 by pressing &quot;Up&quot;, &quot;Down&quot;, &quot;Left&quot;, and &quot;Right&quot;).;

The cover of the first ''Madlax'' soundtrack album
Like with many of studio Bee Train's other works (including ''Noir'', her first collaboration with them), the entire ''Madlax'' soundtrack was composed by the acclaimed Yuki Kajiura, making it her and K≈çichi Mashimo's fifth project together. Kajiura and Yuuka Nanri's duo FictionJunction YUUKA recorded the series' opening and ending themes,and &quot;inside your heart&quot;, respectively, as well as two insert songs: &quot;nowhere&quot; and &quot;I'm here&quot;. Aside from the opening sequence, &quot;Fragments of an Eye&quot; is featured in the series itself: at the end of episode 18 and in the episode 24, when Margaret is humming its tune (along with another song called &quot;Cradle&quot;) to herself in the flower field.

The entire OST has been released on two albums in 2004. Two singles were published in the same year by FictionJunction YUUKA, each containing an opening/ending theme and one insert song, as well as their respective karaoke versions.;See also the complete track listings for [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Madlax_OST_I OST 1], [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Madlax_OST_II OST 2], [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Madlax_OP_Single OP-single], [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Madlax_ED_Single ED-single] on ''Bee Train Fan Wiki''.; In an interview Kajiura recalls having written the score in a hotel high-rise to save studio costs, and that this change in location helped her to explore different styles of music.;;

In the insert song &quot;nowhere&quot;, there is a frequently repeated background refrain , which is meaningless chanting rather than an actual word. Since the song usually plays when Madlax is fighting, &quot;Yanmaani&quot; has become something of a joke to many ''Madlax'' fans: its loud singing has come to symbolize Madlax's apparent invincibility - some see it as a kind of &quot;magic word&quot; that powers Madlax up for battle, in accordance with the magical girl genre canons.;)''|publisher=ADV Films|location=Houston, Texas|publisherid=DMAD/002|year=2005}};

''Madlax the Bible'' cover
''MADLAX the Bible'' (ISBN 4-89425-375-5) is a 95-page artbook that was published in Japan on 21 May 2005 by Hobby Japan.;; Aside from color and BW illustrations and artworks for the series, it contains interviews with its authors and seiy≈´s, as well as diverse additional information about the show in Japanese.;; The artbook has never been published outside of Japan. Since the word &quot;Bible&quot; is derived from , meaning &quot;holy books&quot;, it is likely that the artbook's title is a reference to the Fictional setting of Madlax#Holy Books|Holy Books that play an important role in the series' plot.

A resin model kit known as &quot;Madlax with Guns&quot; has been produced, featuring a figurine of Madlax dual wielding her signature SIG P210s.;; Another, a polystone figurine entitled simply &quot;Madlax&quot;, was launched in August 2007.;; In Japan, a T-shirt with ''Madlax'' logo has been added to the limited edition of the first DVD volume,;; and the &quot;first press&quot; of the OST albums came with logotype mousepads.;;;

Reception

Unlike ''Noir'', which became instantly successful in Japan and Western countries despite controversial opinions about it, ''Madlax'' has never been able to match it in fame and received only moderate (though generally approving) attention from the critics. ''Madlax'' was often accused of being secondary and reusing ''Noirs stylistic solutions, such as the story premise, the two heroines' appearance, and the musical style.; Nevertheless, some sources praised the story for being more monolithic and consequent than its predecessor's, owing to all its episodes and subplots being tightly intertwined and held together by the primary A-Plot.;

The majority of reviewers perceived the early episodes of ''Madlax'' as boring and too slow-paced,; but some of the same critics later remarked that the prolonged exposition is crucial to the unusual finale of the series, which fully establishes the series' own identity and sets it apart from other works.;;;;; According to them, after the initial volume, the story gets better and better with every new episode,;;; though some have been dissatisfied with its &quot;pseudo-existentialistic&quot; ending.; Erica Friedman, the president of Yuricon, highly praised Kuroda's script, naming it &quot;the best writing that Bee Train has done&quot;.; Professional reviewers welcomed the increased number of sympathetic characters,; especially of the distinguishable male ones (Friday, Carrossea, Colonel Burton), as opposed to stormtrooper-like operatives of Soldats in ''Noir'',; but the female character designs were still said to be much more detailed (to the point of fanservice in case of Madlax) than more generic male ones.;

The high quality of the animation in ''Madlax'' was generally acknowledged.;; On the negative side, the episodes that involve computer use and hacking received criticism for their lack of realism.; In terms of soundtrack, ''Madlax'' has not become as innovative as ''Noir'',;; with critics suggesting its OST to be a blend of ''Noir'' and ''.hack//Sign'' styles.;,..}}; Nevertheless, the reviewers acknowledged its superiority over the majority of contemporary works.;; The English translation released by ADV Films was praised for preserving most of the series' original stylistic aspects and inviting veteran voice actors for the dub.; Reviewers went as far as to suggest that several English voices (especially Mike Kleinhenz's) match the characters better than the Japanese ones.;

The initial slow pacing, especially compared to the first episodes of ''Noir'',; became a main reason why the audience often dropped watching ''Madlax'' before it could present its later story turns which eventually resulted in the moderate success of the series.; Among other suggested reasons behind the mediocre popularity of the show were: the market saturation, which resulted from other anime series attempting to repeat the success of ''Noir'' since 2001; the expectable disinterest against a &quot;''Noir'' remake&quot;, found among the fans of the first series;; the over-the-top action scenes that some felt to be ridiculous;;; and its unconventional genre, which straddled ''Madlax'' uncomfortably between fans of mystical science fiction and those who prefer ''Noir'';';s strict realism.;
