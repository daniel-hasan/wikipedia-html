Biography
=Early life=
Lethem was born in Brooklyn, New York to [http://www.richardlethem.com Richard Brown Lethem], an avant-garde painter, and Judith Lethem, a political activist.He was the eldest of three children; his brother, Blake, is an artist, and his sister, Mara, is a photographer and writer.;McGlone, Jackie.[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/critique.cfm?id=816862007 &quot;Brooklyn dodger&quot;], The Scotsman, 2007-05-26.Retrieved on 2007-08-29.;Jonathan was raised in a commune in the pre-gentrified Brooklyn neighborhood of Boerum Hill.Despite a pervasive feeling of racial tension, he later described his Bohemian childhood as “thrilling” and culturally wide-reaching;; he gained an encyclopedic knowledge of the music of Bob Dylan, saw ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars'' twenty-one times during its original theatrical release,;Edemariam, Aida. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2093135,00.html &quot;The borrower&quot;], The Guardian, 2007-06-02.Retrieved on 2007-08-01.; and read the complete works of the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick.Lethem later called Dick’s work “as formative an influence as marijuana or punk rock—as equally responsible for beautifully fucking up my life, for bending it irreversibly along a course I still travel.”;Lethem (2005). p. 77.;

His parents divorced when Jonathan was young, and when he was thirteen, Judith died from a cancerous brain tumor,;Lethem (2005). p. 36-37.; an experience he has said haunted him and heavily affected his writing.In 2007, he explained that &quot;My books all have this giant, howling missing [center]—language has disappeared, or someone has vanished, or memory has gone.&quot;;Intending to become a visual artist like his father, Lethem attended The High School of Music &amp; Art, where he painted in a style he describes as &quot;glib, show-offy, usually cartoonish.&quot;;[http://www.postroadmag.com/Issue_5/Etcetera5/Lethem.htm “Interview: Jonathan Lethem&quot;], Post Road Magazine, Fall/Winter 2002.Retrieved on 2007-08-29.;At Music &amp; Art he produced his own zine, ''The Literary Exchange,'' that featured artwork and writing, created animated films, and wrote a 125-page unpublished novel, ''Heroes''.

After graduating from high school, Lethem entered Bennington College in Vermont in 1982 as a prospective art student.At Bennington, Lethem experienced an “overwhelming....collision with the realities of class—my parents’ bohemian milieu had kept me from understanding, even a little, that we were poor....at Bennington that was all demolished by an encounter with the fact of real privilege.” ;This, coupled with a growing realization that he was more interested in writing than art, led Lethem to drop out halfway through his sophomore year.He hitchhiked from Denver, Colorado to Berkeley, California in 1984, in what he called &quot;one of the stupidest and most memorable things I've ever done.&quot;;Kelleghan, Fiona.

Lethem published his first short story in 1989, and published several more in the early 1990s.;Houle, Zachary.[http://www.sfsite.com/11b/jl93.htm &quot;A Conversation With Jonathan Lethem&quot;], The SF Site, November 2000.Retrieved on 2007-08-29.;

=First novels=
Lethem’s first novel, ''Gun, with Occasional Music'', is a merging of science fiction and the Chandleresque detective story which includes talking kangaroos, radical futuristic versions of the drug scene, and cryogenic prisons.The novel was published in 1994 by Harcourt Brace, in what Lethem later described as a &quot;delirious&quot; experience.&quot;I'd pictured my first novels being published as paperback originals,” he recalled, &quot;and instead a prestigious house was doing the book in cloth....I was in heaven.&quot;;The novel was released to little initial fanfare, but an enthusiastic review in ''Newsweek'', which declared ''Gun'' an &quot;audaciously assured first novel,&quot; catapulted the book to wider commercial success.;Gaffney, Elizabeth.[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA165462.html &quot;Jonathan Lethem: Breaking the Barriers Between Genres&quot;], Publishers Weekly, 1998-03-30.Retrieved on 2007-09-19.;''Gun, with Occasional Music'' was a finalist for the 1994 Nebula Award, and placed first in the &quot;Best First Novel&quot; category of the 1995 ''Locus Magazine'' reader's poll.In the mid-1990s, film producer Alan J. Pakula optioned the novel's movie rights, which allowed Lethem to quit working in bookstores and devote his time to writing.;

He followed ''Gun, with Occasional Music'' in 1995 with his second novel.Partially inspired by Lethem's experiences hitchhiking cross-country,; ''Amnesia Moon'' uses a road narrative to explore a multi-post-apocalyptic future landscape rife with perception tricks.After publishing many of his early stories in a 1996 collection (''The Wall of the Sky, the Wall of the Eye''), Lethem's third novel, ''As She Climbed Across the Table'', was published in 1997.The novel takes as its starting point a physics researcher who falls in love with an artificially generated spatial anomaly called &quot;Lack&quot;, for whom she spurns her previous partner.Her ex-partner's comic struggle with this rejection, and with the anomaly constitute the majority of the narrative.

In 1996, Lethem moved from the San Francisco Bay Area back to Brooklyn.; His next book, published after his return to Brooklyn, was ''Girl in Landscape''.In the novel, a young girl must endure puberty while also having to face a strange and new world populated by aliens known as Archbuilders.''Girl in Landscapes plot and characters, including the figures of a young girl and a violently protective father figure, were &quot;very strongly influenced&quot; by the 1956 John Wayne Western ''The Searchers'', a movie with which Lethem is &quot;obsessed.&quot;;Lethem, Jonathan.[http://www.locusmag.com/1997/Issues/10/Lethem.html &quot;Breeding Hybrids in the Genre Garden&quot;], Locus Magazine, October 1997.Retrieved on 2007-09-19.;

=Mainstream success and &quot;genre bending&quot;=
The first novel Lethem began after returning to New York City was ''Motherless Brooklyn'', a return to the detective theme, this time maintaining objective realism while exploring subjective alterity through Lionel Essrog, a protagonist with Tourette syndrome who is obsessed with language.Lethem later called Essrog &quot;obviously the character I’ve written with whom I most identify,&quot; and explained that the novel &quot;stands outside myself....It’s the only one which doesn’t need me, never did.It would have found someone to write it, by necessity.&quot;;Upon its publication in 1999, ''Motherless Brooklyn'' won the National Book Critics Circle Award#Fiction|National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction, The Macallan Gold Dagger for crime fiction, and the ''Salon.com|Salon'' Book Award, and was named book of the year by ''Esquire''. In 1999, Edward Norton announced that he was planning to write, direct and star in a film adaptation of the novel;;Fleming, Michael.[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117756590.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 &quot;Norton birthing 'Motherless': New Line nurturing Lethem novel&quot;], Variety, 1999-10-13.Retrieved on 2007-08-29.; as of December 2007, Norton was still working on the project.;Chonin, Neva.

The mainstream success of ''Motherless Brooklyn'' made Lethem, according to ''The New York Times'', &quot;something of a hipster celebrity,&quot; and he was referred to several times as a &quot;genre bender.&quot;;Cardwell, Diane.[http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F20817FC3D5E0C758DDDA00894DB404482 &quot;Untangling the Knots of a Brooklyn Boyhood&quot;] (fee required), The New York Times, 2003-09-16.Retrieved on 2007-08-29.;Critics cited Lethem's various novels, which were alternately hardboiled detective fiction, science fiction, and autobiographical.(Lethem credited his comfort in genre-mixing to his father's art, which &quot;always combined observed and imagined reality on the same canvas, very naturally, very un-self-consciously.&quot;);In ''Time'' magazine, Lev Grossman classed Lethem with a movement of authors similarly eager to blend literary and popular writing, including Michael Chabon (with whom Lethem is friends),;Henderson, Eleanor. [http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2007/summer/henderson-chabon-yiddish-policemen/ &quot;From Pittsburgh to Sitka: On Michael Chabon’s ''The Yiddish Policemen’s Union''&quot;] (book review), The Virginia Quarterly Review, Summer 2007. Retrieved on 2007-07-28.; Margaret Atwood,and Susanna Clarke.;;

In 2003, Lethem definitively described his opinion of his supposed &quot;genre bending&quot;:


In the early 2000s, Lethem published a story collection, edited two anthologies, wrote magazine pieces, and published the 55-page novella ''This Shape We're In'' in 2000.''This Shape We're In'' was one of the first offerings from McSweeney's Books, the publishing imprint that arose from Dave Eggers's ''McSweeney's Quarterly Concern''.

In November 2000, Lethem said that he was working on an uncharacteristically &quot;big sprawling&quot; novel, about a child who grows up to be a rock journalist.;The novel was published in 2003, as ''The Fortress of Solitude''.The semi-autobiographical bildungsroman features dozens of characters in a variety of milieus, but centers on a tale of racial tensions and boyhood in Brooklyn during the late 1970s.The main characters are two friends of different backgrounds who grew up on the same block in Boerum Hill. It was named one of nine &quot;Editor's Choice&quot; books of the year by ''The New York Times '' and has been published in fifteen languages. 

His second collection of short fiction, ''Men and Cartoons'', was published in late 2004. In March 2005, ''The Disappointment Artist'', his first collection of essays, was released.On September 20, 2005, Lethem was named one of the 2005 recipients of the Macarthur Grant#MacArthur Fellowship|MacArthur Fellowship, often referred to as the &quot;genius grant.&quot;

After ''Motherless Brooklyn'' and ''The Fortress of Solitude'', Lethem decided that &quot;[i]t was time to leave Brooklyn in a literary sense anyway….I really needed to defy all that stuff about place and memory.&quot;;In 2007, he returned to the setting of California, where some of his earlier fiction took place, with ''You Don't Love Me Yet'', a novel about an upstart rock band. The novel revolves around a woman in the band, Lucinda, who answers phones for her friend's complaint line and uses some of a caller's words as lyrics.According to Lethem, ''You Don't Love Me Yet'' was inspired by the years he spent as the lead singer in an upstart California bandin the late 1980s and early 1990s, during what he called &quot;the unformed posturing phase of life.&quot;;Gilbert, Megan.[http://www.zoom-in.com/blog/2007/05/a_hit_song_of_the_mind_profile_of_jonathan_lethem_author_you_dont_love_me_yet &quot;A Hit Song of the Mind: Profile of Jonathan Lethem, Author, You Don't Love Me Yet&quot;], 2007-05-21.Retrieved on 2007-08-29.;The novel received mixed reviews.;Edemariam, Aida.
