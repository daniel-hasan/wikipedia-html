Cape Lisburne is a Cape in Alaska. It is located at the NW point of the Lisburne Peninsula on the Chukchi Sea coast, 40 mi. NE of village of Point Hope, Arctic Slope. 

Discovered and named by Captain Cook (1785, p. 460), RN, on August 21, 1778 who wrote &quot;The southern extreme seemed to form a point which was named Cape Lisburne.&quot; 

An early Inuit name for the cape was &quot;Uivaq,&quot; generally spelled &quot;Wevuk&quot; or &quot;Wevok.&quot; Cape Lisburne was often referred to as &quot;Uivaq Ungasiktoq&quot; meaning &quot;distant cape&quot; as opposed to &quot;Uivaq Qanitoq&quot; (Cape Thompson) meaning &quot;near cape.&quot;
