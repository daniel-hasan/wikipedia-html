The apneustic center of the lower pons appears to promote inspiration by stimulation of the ''I'' neurons in the medulla oblongata providing a constant stimulus.

The apneustic centre of pons sends signals to the dorsal respiratory centre in the medulla to delay the 'switch off' signal of the inspiratory ramp provided by the Pneumotaxic_center|pneumotaxic centre of pons.It controls the the intensity of breathing.
