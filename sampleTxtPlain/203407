A year after she had learned English, Dion made her debut into the Anglophone market with ''Unison'' (1990).;[http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/D/Dion_Celine.html Celine Dion Biography]. &quot;Canoe Jam!.&quot; Retrieved September 13, 2007; She incorporated the help of many established musicians, including Vito Luprano and Canadian producer David Foster.;Alexander, Charles P.

March 07, 1994; The album was largely influenced by 1980s soft rock music that quickly found a niche within the adult contemporary radio format. ''Unison'' hit the right notes with critics: Jim Faber of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote that Dion's vocals were &quot;tastefully unadorned,&quot; and that she never attempted to &quot;bring off styles that are beyond her.&quot;;; Stephen Erlewine of ''All Music Guide'' declared it as, &quot;a fine, sophisticated American debut.&quot;;; Singles from the album included &quot;(If There Was) Any Other Way,&quot; &quot;The Last to Know,&quot; &quot;Unison (song)#Céline Dion version)|Unison,&quot; and &quot;Where Does My Heart Beat Now,&quot; a mid-tempo soft-rock ballad which made prominent use of the electric guitar. The latter became her first single to chart on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100, peaking at number four. The album established Dion as a rising singer in the United States, and across Continental Europe and Asia. In 1991, Dion was also a soloist in &quot;Voices That Care,&quot; a tribute to American troops fighting in Operation Desert Storm. 








Dion's real international breakthrough came when she duetted with Peabo Bryson on the title track to Disney's animated film ''Beauty and the Beast'' (1991).;Bliss, Karen. &quot;25 Years of Canadian Artists.&quot; ''Canadian Musician''. March 01, 2004. pg. 34. ISSN: 07089635; The song captured a musical style that Dion would utilize in the future: sweeping, classically influenced ballads with soft instrumentation.

[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980285,00.html The Power of Celine Dion]&quot;. ''Time''. March 07, 1994;
&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was featured on Dion's 1992 self-titled album, which, like her debut, had a strong rock influence combined with elements of soul and classical music. Owing to the success of the lead-off single and her collaboration with Foster and Diane Warren, the album was as well received as ''Unison''. Other singles that achieved moderate success included &quot;If You Asked Me To#Céline Dion version|If You Asked Me To&quot; (a cover of Patti LaBelle's song from the 1989 movie ''Licence to Kill'') which peaked at number four on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100, the gospel-tinged &quot;Love Can Move Mountains,&quot; and &quot;Nothing Broken But My Heart.&quot; As with Dion's earlier releases, the album had an overtone of love. 

By 1992 ''Unison'', ''Céline Dion'', and media appearances had propelled Dion to superstardom in North America. She had achieved one of her main objectives: wedging her way into the Anglophone market and achieving fame.;Alexander, Charles P. &quot;The Arts &amp; Media/Music: At Age Five She Belted Out French pop tunes standing atop tables.&quot; ''Time International''.

She asserted that she was &amp;mdash; and would always be&amp;mdash; a French, not an English, artist.;;;; Apart from her commercial success, there were also changes in Dion's personal life, as Angélil, who was twenty-six years her senior, transitioned from manager to lover.

In 1993 Dion announced her feelings for her manager by declaring him &quot;the colour of [her] love&quot; in the dedication section of her third Anglophone album ''The Colour of My Love''.

''The Colour of My Love'' also became Dion's first bona fide hit in Europe, and in particular the United Kingdom. Both the album and the single &quot;Think Twice&quot; simultaneously occupied the top of the British charts for five consecutive weeks. &quot;Think Twice,&quot; which remained at number one for seven weeks, eventually became the fourth single by a female artist to sell in excess of one million copies in the U.K.,;; while the album was eventually certified five-times platinum for two-million copies sold.

The mid-1990s was a transitional period for Dion's musical style, as she slowly diverged from strong rock influences and transitioned into a more pop and soul style (though the electric guitar remained a central part of her music).

=2002–2003: Return to music=
Dion's aptly titled ''A New Day Has Come'', released in March 2002, ended her three-year break from the music industry. The album was Dion's most personal yet, and established a more mature side of Dion with the songs &quot;A New Day Has Come,&quot; &quot;I'm Alive,&quot; and &quot;Goodbye's (The Saddest Word),&quot; a change that resulted from her new-found maternal responsibilities, because, in her own words, &quot;becoming a mother makes you a grown-up.&quot;;; She stated, &quot;''A New Day Has Come'', for Rene, for me, is the baby.

Retrieved May 17 2007.; Sal Cinquemani of ''Slant'' magazine called the album &quot;a lengthy collection of drippy, gooey pop fluffer-nutter.&quot;;; 

The upbeat tempo of &quot;One Heart&quot; and the bright colours and &quot;party&quot; style of the music video were a new direction to Céline Dion's work.

Drawing inspiration from personal experiences, Dion released ''One Heart'' (2003), an album that represented her appreciation for life.;Flick, Larry. ''One Heart''. Billboard'' magazine. New York: March 29 2003. Vol.115, Iss. 13; pg. 30, 1 pgs; The album largely consisted of dance music &amp;mdash; a deviation from the soaring, melodramatic ballads, for which she had once been given mixed reception. Although it achieved moderate success, ''One Heart'' hinted at Dions' inability to overcome the creative wall that she had hit, and words such as &quot;predictable&quot; and &quot;banal&quot; appeared even in the most lenient reviews.;;;Durchholz, Daniel.

However, it was dismissed as Dion trying to please her sponsors.;Murray, Sonia. ''Céline Dion's latest takes easy, well-worn route''. The Atlanta Journal–Constitution. Atlanta, Georgia: March 25 2003. pg. C.1.; 

By the mid 2000s Dion's music had changed to the point where her releases possessed maternal overtones. ''Miracle'' (2004), a multimedia project conceived by Dion and photographer Anne Geddes, had a theme centering on babies and motherhood. The album was saturated with lullabies and other songs of maternal love and inspiration, the two most popular being covers of Louis Armstrong's &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; and John Lennon's &quot;Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)#Céline Dion version|Beautiful Boy.&quot; The reviews for ''Miracle'' were generally weak: while Charles Taylor of ''Billboard'' magazine wrote that the single &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot; was &quot;an unexpected gem&quot; and called Dion &quot;a timeless, enormously versatile artist,&quot;;Taylor, Chuck. ''Céline Dion: &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot;''. ''Billboard''. New York: October 16, 2004.Vol.116, Iss. 42; pg. 33, 1 pgs; Chuck Arnold of ''People'' Magazine labeled the album as excessively sentimental,;Arnold, Chuck. &quot;Review: Celine Dion, Miracle.&quot; ''People Magazine.'' November 22 2004. pg, 48.; while Nancy Miller of ''Entertainment Weekly'' opined that &quot;the whole earth-mama act is just opportunism.&quot;;; 

The Francophone album ''1 fille &amp; 4 types'' (''1 Girl &amp; 4 Guys'', 2003), fared better than her first two comebacks, and showed Dion trying to distance herself from the &quot;diva&quot; image. She recruited Jean-Jacques Goldman, Gildas Arzel, Eric Benzi, and Jacques Veneruso, with whom she had previously worked on two of her best selling French albums ''S'il suffisait d'aimer'' and ''D'eux''. Labeled &quot;the album of pleasure&quot; by Dion herself, the cover showed Dion in a simple and relaxed manner, contrary to the choreographed poses usually found on her album covers. The album achieved relative critical success: reviewer Stephen Erlwine of ''All Music Guide'' wrote that Dion was &quot;getting back to pop basics and performing at a level unheard in a while.&quot;;; 

Though her albums were relatively successful, signs of a decline began to appear in the poorer critical reception of ''The Collector's Series, Volume One'' (2000), ''A New Day Has Come'' (2002), and ''One Heart'' (2003). The mass appeal of Dion's later works had declined due to the nature of the themes. Her songs received less airplay as radio became less embracing of balladeers like Dion, Carey and Houston, and was focused on more up-tempo, Urban/Hip-hop songs.;Gardner, Elysa. [http://www.usatoday.com/life/dcovfri.htm Mariah Carey, 'standing again']. ''USA Today''. November 28 2002.

Dion performing &quot;I'm Alive&quot; during her show ''A New Day...'' in Las Vegas.

In early 2002 Dion had announced a three-year, 600-show contract to appear five nights a week in an entertainment extravaganza, ''A New Day...'', at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas.;Helligar, Jeremy. &quot;Celine Dion livin' la vida Vegas!.&quot; ''Us''. March 31, 2003.pg 56.; This move was seen as &quot;one of the smartest business decisions in years by any major recording artist&quot; given the relatively poor performance of her current releases.;Di Nunzio, Miriam. '';'A New Day';: Vegas gamble pays off for Céline Dion&quot;''. Chicago Sun-Times, March 20, 2005.; She conceived the idea for the show after seeing ''O'' byFranco Dragone early in her break from recording, and began on March 25 2003, in a 4000-seat arena designed for her show.;Helligar, Jeremy. &quot;Celine Dion livin' la vida Vegas!.&quot; ''Us''. March 31, 2003.pg 56.; The show, put together by Dragone, is a combination of dance, music, and visual effects. It includes Dion performing her biggest hits against an array of dancers and special effects.

Reviewer Mike Weatherford felt that, at first, Dion was not as relaxed as she should be, and at times, it was hard to find the singer among the excessive stage ornamentations and dancers. However, he noted that the show has become more enjoyable, due to Dion's improved stage-presence and simpler costumes.;; 
The show has also been well-received by audiences, despite the complaints of expensive tickets; the show has sold out almost every night since its 2003 opening. According to ''Pollstar'', Dion had sold 322,000 tickets and grossed US$43.9 million in the first half of 2005, and by July 2005, she had sold out 315 out of 384 shows.;;
By the end of 2005, Dion grossed more than US$76 million, placing sixth on ''Billboard's Money Makers list for 2005''.;; ''A New Day...'' was the 6th biggest selling tour in America in 2006.;; Because of the show's success, Dion's contract was extended into 2007 for an undisclosed sum. On January 5 2007 it was announced that the show will end on December 15 2007, with tickets for the period after October 2007 having gone on sale from March 1.;; The ''Live in Las Vegas - A New Day...'' DVD was released on December 10 2007 in Europe and the following day in North America.; ;

In 2005, Dion released her first comprehensive greatest hits album in French, ''On ne change pas'', which features three new songs, including a duet with Il Divo called &quot;I Believe in You&quot;. Her latest French language album, ''D'elles'', released on May 21 2007, debuted at the top of the Canadian album charts, selling 72,200 copies in its first week. It marked her tenth number-one album in the SoundScan era, and her eighth to debut at the top position. In Canada, the album has been certified 2x platinum, and within the first week has already shipped half a million units worldwide.;; ''D'Elles'' also reached No. 1 in France and Belgium. The first single &quot;Et s'il n'en restait qu'une (je serais celle-là)&quot; debuted at the top of the French singles chart a month earlier. 

On October 27, 2007 Dion appeared on the fourth series of the British talent contest, ''The X Factor'', as a mentor to the show's contestants.

Artistry and image
Dion grew up listening to the music of Aretha Franklin, Michael Jackson, Carole King, Anne Murray, Barbra Streisand, and the Bee Gees, all of whom she would eventually collaborate with. During her younger years, which she spent performing in her parents' piano bar along with her other siblings, she also performed many songs by Ginette Reno and other popular Quebecois artists. She has also expressed appreciation for Édith Piaf, Sir Elton John, and opera singer Luciano Pavarotti, as well as many soul singers of the 1960s, 70's and 80's, including Roberta Flack, Etta James and Patti Labelle, whose songs she would later rerecord. Her English-language material has been influenced by numerous genres, including pop, rock, gospel, R&amp;B and soul, and her lyrics focus on themes of poverty, world hunger, and spirituality, with an overemphasis on love and romance.;[http://www.pluggedinonline.com/music/music/a0001109.cfm Celine Dion, ''The Colour of My Love'']. ''Plugged in''.

Dion has faced considerable criticism from many critics, who state that her music often retreats behind pop and soul conventions, and marked by excessive sentimentality.;;;;;; According to Keith Harris of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, &quot;[Dion's] sentimentality is bombastic and defiant rather than demure and retiring....[she] stands at the end of the chain of drastic devolution that goes Aretha-Whitney-Mariah. Far from being an aberration, Dion actually stands as a symbol of a certain kind of pop sensibility &amp;mdash; bigger is better, too much is never enough, and the riper the emotion the more true.&quot;;''The New Rolling Stone Album Guide'' 2004.; Dion's francophone releases, by contrast, tend to be deeper and more varied than her English releases, and consequently have achieved more credibility.;&quot;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/celinedion.html The real Céline: Céline Dion’s new French album shows her personal side].&quot; ''CBC''.

As Charles Alexander of ''Time'' writes, &quot;Her voice glides effortlessly from deep whispers to dead-on high notes, a sweet siren that combines force with grace.&quot;;Alexander, Charles P. &quot;The Arts &amp; Media/Music: At Age Five She Belted Out French pop tunes standing atop tables.&quot; ''Time International''. February 28 1994. pg 44.; As her music progressed, however, Dion's vocal performances came to resemble more closely those of her contemporaries, especially Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey;Mulholland, Garry. ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music'' (2003). pg. 57. UK: Flame Tree Publishing. ISBN 1-904041-70-1.;, and she was heavily criticized for oversinging and for lacking the emotional intensity that once was a part of her earlier work.;Dollar, Steve.

Los Angeles, Calif.: March 27 1997. pg. 47); One critic noted that the emotion, &quot;seems to have been trained right out of her lovely voice,&quot; leaving her with &quot;more voice than heart.&quot;;; 







Many critics have stated that Dion's involvement in the production aspect of her music is fundamentally lacking, which results in her work being overproduced;&quot;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/celinedion.html The real Céline: Céline Dion’s new French album shows her personal side].&quot; ''CBC''. May 29, 2007. Retrieved September 25, 2007.; and impersonal.;&quot;Celine Dion.&quot; ''Newsmakers 1995'', Issue 4. Gale Research, 1995.; Additionally, while she came from a family in which all of her siblings were musicians, she never learned to play any musical instruments. However, she did help to compose many of her earlier French songs, and had always tried to involve herself with the production and recording of her albums. On her first English album, which she recorded before she had a firm command of the English language, she expressed disapproval of the record, which, according to her, could have been avoided if she had assumed more creative input.;&quot;Celine Dion.&quot; ''Newsmakers 1995'', Issue 4. Gale Research, 1995.; By the time she released her second English album ''Celine Dion'', she had assumed more control of the production and recording process, hoping to dispel earlier criticisms. She stated, &quot;On the second album I said, 'Well, I have the choice to be afraid one more time and not be 100 percent happy, or not be afraid and be part of this album.' This is my album.&quot;;&quot;Celine Dion.&quot; ''Newsmakers 1995'', Issue 4. Gale Research, 1995.; She would continue to involve herself in the production of subsequent releases, helping to write a few of her songs on ''Let's Talk About Love'' (1997) and ''These Are Special Times'' (1998).;Among others, Dion helped to compose &quot;Treat Her Like a Lady&quot; from ''Let's Talk About love'', and &quot;Don't Save It All for Christmas Day&quot; from ''These Are Special Times'';

Despite her success, Dion is often the subject of media ridicule and parody. She is frequently impersonated on shows like ''MADtv'', ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''South Park'' for her strong accent, as well as her conservative nature and on-stage movements. She is also heavily mocked in her home country of Canada on popular shows ''Royal Canadian Air Farce'' and ''This Hour Has 22 Minutes''. However, Dion has stated that she is unaffected by the comments, and has even stated that she is flattered that people take the time to impersonate her.;; She even invited Ana Gasteyer, who parodied her on SNL, to appear on stage during one of her performances.

Dion is rarely the center of media controversies. However, in 2005, following the Hurricane Katrina disaster, she appeared on ''Larry King Live'' and tearfully criticized U.S. President George W. Bush regarding the Iraq War and his slow response in aiding the victims of Hurricane Katrina: &quot;How come it's so easy to send planes in another country, to kill everyone in a second, to destroy lives? We need to be there right now to rescue the rest of the people.&quot;;; She later claimed, &quot;When I do interviews with Larry King or the big TV shows like that, they put you on the spot, which is very difficult. I do have an opinion, but I'm a singer. I'm not a politician.&quot;;;

Other activities
Dion became an entrepreneur with the establishment of her franchise restaurant Nickels Grill &amp; Bar|&quot;Nickels&quot; in 1990. She has since divested her interests in the chain and is no longer affiliated with ''Nickels'' as of 1997.

The effort raised money from more than 100 countries and benefited many orphanages and children's health organizations. Dion has also been a major supporter of the T.J. Martell Foundation, the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, and many health and education campaigns. She also donated $1 million to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and held a fund-raising event for the victims of the 2004 Asian Tsunami, raising more than $1 million.;Wray, James. &quot;[http://music.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_3487.php/Celine_Dion_to_Raise_One_Million_for_Tsunami_Victims Celine Dion to Raise One Million for Tsunami Victims]&quot;.
