''Nepenthes bicalcarata'' (, Latin: ''bi'' = two, ''calcaratus'' = spur), also known as the Fanged Pitcher-Plant,;Phillipps, A. &amp; A. Lamb 1996. ''Pitcher-Plants of Borneo''. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.; is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to northwestern Borneo.

Botanical history
Illustration of ''N. bicalcarata''from Macfarlane's 1908 monograph
''N. bicalcarata'' was formally described by Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1873, based on specimens collected by Hugh Low and Odoardo Beccari near Lawas River in Borneo.;Hooker, J.D. 1873. Nepenthaceae. In: A. De Candolle ''Prodromus systematis universalis regni vegetabilis'' 17: 90–105.; The type specimen, ''Low s.n.'', is deposited at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.;Schlauer, J. 2006. [http://www.omnisterra.com/bot/cp_home.cgi?name=bicalcarata&amp;search=all ''Nepenthes bicalcarata'']. Carnivorous Plant Database.; Seven years later, Spencer Le Marchant Moore described ''Nepenthes dyak'', based on a specimen collected by Johannes Elias Teijsmann, ''Teijsmann 10962'', from Kapuas River near Sintang in western Borneo.;Moore, S.L.M. 1880. Alabastra diversa. ''The Journal of Botany'' 18: 1–8.;;Jebb, M.H.P. &amp; M.R. Cheek 1997. A Skeletal Revision of ''Nepenthes'' (Nepenthaceae). ''Blumea'' 42 (1): 1–106.; This specimen is also held at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; and a duplicate is deposited at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden.;[http://145.18.162.53:81/c8?ent=300017&amp;rec=48918&amp;sct=1 Specimen detail: ''Teijsmann 10962'']. Nationaal Herbarium Nederland.; ''N. dyak'' was later mentioned several more times in the literature,;Burbidge, F.W. 1882. Notes on the new ''Nepenthes''. ''The Gardeners' Chronicle'' 17(1): 56;;Beccari, O. 1896. Malesia, III (1886–1890): Rivista delle specie del genere ''Nepenthes'', p. 1–15.; but is now considered conspecific with ''N. bicalcarta''.;

''N. bicalcarata'' was introduced to Europe in 1879 by British explorer Frederick William Burbidge, who collected plants for the famous Veitch Nursery. These were cultivated to larger size and distributed in 1881.;

During this time, interest in ''Nepenthes'' had reached its peak. A note in ''The Gardeners' Chronicle'' of 1881 mentions the Veitch Nursery's ''N. bicalcarata'' as follows:;[Anonymous] 1881. Messr's Veitch's Nepenthes House. ''The Gardeners' Chronicle'' n. ser. 16: 598.;

;&quot;Then there is ''N. bicalcarata'', a most robust habited kind with sturdy foliage and bag-like pitchers provided with a vicious-looking rat-trap-like apparatus in its lid which renders it very distinct from its neighbours.&quot;;

Several years after its introduction, ''N. bicalcarata'' was still very much a horticultural rarity. In Veitch's catalogue for 1889, ''N. bicalcarata'' was priced at £3.3s per plant, while the famous giant-pitchered ''N. northiana'' and ''N. rajah'' were selling for £2.2s.;

Description

''N. bicalcarata'' plants are the largest in the genus, climbing up to 20 m into the forest canopy. The cylindrical stem is thicker than that of any other ''Nepenthes'' species, measuring up to 3.5 cm in diameter. Internodes are up to 40 cm long.;Clarke, C.M. 1997. ''Nepenthes of Borneo''.Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.;;Steiner, H. 2002. ''Borneo: Its Mountains and Lowlands with their Pitcher Plants''. Toihaan Publishing Company, Kota Kinabalu.;

Climbing plant with upper pitchers

The leaves of ''N. bicalcarata'' are wikt:petiolate|petiolate and wikt:coriaceous|coriaceous in texture. The wikt:lamina|lamina is wikt:obovate|obovate-wikt:lanceolate|lanceolate in form and also reaches huge dimensions, growing to 80 cm in length and 12 cm in width.;Danser, B.H. 1928. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. ''Bulletin de Jardin de Botanique, Buitenzorg'', Série III, 9(3–4): 249–438.; It is slightly wikt:decurrent|decurrent on the stem, forming two narrow wings. The lamina has indistinct longitudinal veins and numerous wikt:pennate|pennate veins. Tendrils may be up to 60 cm long and 8 mm wide. They are hollow and swollen near the pitcher.;

Lower pitchers

Although most parts of the plant are very large, the pitchers themselves do not rival those of species such as ''N. rajah''. Nevertheless, they may have a volume of over one litre and grow up to 25 cm high and 16 cm wide. The two sharp spines for which the species is famous are present on the underside of the pitcher lid, and may be 3 cm long. A pair of prominent fringed wings (≤15 mm wide) run down the front of lower pitchers. These are usually reduced to ribs in aerial pitchers. The peristome (≤20 mm wide) is characteristically flattened and curved inwards. It bears small but distinct teeth. The pitcher lid or operculum is wikt:reniform|reniform to wikt:cordate|cordate and has no appendages. An unbranched spur (≤15 mm long) is inserted at the base of the lid.;

''N. bicalcarata'' has a paniculate inflorescence. The peduncle may be up to 40 cm long and the rachis can reach 100 cm in length. Female inflorescences are usually shorter.;Macfarlane, J.M. 1908. Nepenthaceae. In: A. Engler ''Das Pflanzenreich IV'', III, Heft 36: 1–91.; Branches on the flower stem are up to 40 mm long and bear up to 15 flowers. Sepals are either wikt:obovate|obovate or wikt:lanceolate|lanceolate and up to 4 mm long.;

Mature plants are virtually wikt:glabrous|glabrous. wikt:caducous|Caducous hairs are present on the youngest parts of the plant and on the inflorescences.

''N. bicalcarata'' varies little across its range. Consequently, no infraspecific taxa have been described.;

Carnivory
The two thorns that give ''N. bicalcarata'' its name are unique to this species and bear some of the largest nectar glands in the plant kingdom.;Clarke, C.M. 2001. ''A Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sabah''. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.;;Clarke, C.M. &amp; C.C. Lee 2004. ''Pitcher Plants of Sarawak''. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.; The purpose of these structures has long been debated among botanists. Frederick William Burbidge suggested that they might serve to deter arboreal mammals such as tarsiers, lorises and monkeys from stealing the contents of the pitchers. In an article published in 1982, Cliff Dodd speculated on the function of the thorns, but did not believe they play a role in prey capture.;Dodd, C. 1982.''Carnivorous Plant Newsletter'' 11(3): 64–65, 73, 78.; Charles Clarke observed that monkeys and tarsiers rip the pitchers open at the sides in order to feed from them, rather than reaching in through the pitcher mouth.;Clarke, C.[M.] 1993.''Carnivorous Plant Newsletter'' 22(1–2): 27–28.; However, he found that the mammals attacked the pitchers of ''N. bicalcarata'' less frequently than those of other species, such as ''N. rafflesiana''.; Clarke's observations suggest that the spines likely serve to lure insects into a precarious position over the pitcher mouth, where they may lose their footing and fall into the pitcher fluid, eventually drowning.;

A similar trapping method is employed by the Sumatran endemic ''N. lingulata'', which has a single wikt:filiform|filiform appendage positioned over the pitcher mouth. However, in that species the appendage is a structure of the lid and not the peristome.;Lee, C.C., Hernawati &amp; P. Akhriadi 2006. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/nhn/blumea/2006/00000051/00000003/art00007 Two new species of ''Nepenthes'' (Nepenthaceae) from North Sumatra]. ''Blumea'' 51(3): 561–568.;

Association with ants
Upper pitcher with swollen tendril colonised by ''Camponotus schmitzi''.
''N. bicalcarata'' plays host to an unusual species of ant that makes its nest in the plant's hollow tendrils.;;Shelford, R. 1916. ''A naturalist in Borneo''. T. Fisher Unwin, London.;;Cresswell, J.E. 2000. Resource input and the community structure of larval infaunas of an eastern tropical pitcher plant ''Nepenthes bicalcarata''. ''Ecological Entomology'' 25(3): 362–366. ;;Merbach, M.A., G. Zizka, B. Fiala, U. Maschwitz &amp; W.E. Booth 2000. Carnivory and myrmecophytism—a contradiction?

March 2000 in Würzburg Lehrstuhl für Tierökologie und Tropenbiologie Universität Würzburg. p. 106.; Described as ''Camponotus schmitzi'' in 1933,;Schuitemaker, J.P. &amp; A. Stärke 1933.

Stärke, den Dolder. ''Overdruk uit het Natuurhistorisch Maandblad'' 22(3): 29–31.; it is a member of the extremely populous and widespread genus of carpenter ants.

This unique animal-plant interaction was noted by Frederick William Burbidge as early as 1880.;Burbidge, F.W. 1880. ''The Gardens of the Sun''. Murray, London. 364 pp.; In 1904, Odoardo Beccari suggested that the ants feed on insects found on and around the plant, but may fall prey to it themselves.;Beccari, O. 1904. ''Wanderings in the great forests of Borneo''. Archibald and Constable, London.; In 1990, B. Hölldobler and E.O. Wilson proposed that ''N. bicalcarata'' and ''C. schmitzi'' form a mutually beneficial association.;Hölldobler, B. &amp; E.O. Wilson 1990. ''The Ants''. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany.; At the time, however, no experimental data existed to support such a hypothesis. A series of observations and experiments carried out in Brunei by Charles Clarke in 1992 and 1998,;Clarke, C.M. 1992. The ecology of metazoan communities in ''Nepenthes'' pitcher plants in Borneo, with special reference to the community of ''Nepenthes bicalcarata'' Hook.f. Ph.D. thesis, University of New England, Armidale, New South Wales. 269 pp.;;Clarke, C.M. 1998. Initial colonisation and prey capture in ''Nepenthes bicalcarata'' (Nepenthaceae) pitchers in Brunei. ''Sandakania'' 12: 27–36.;;Clarke, C.M. 1998. The aquatic arthropod community of the pitcher plant, ''Nepenthes bicalcarata'' (Nepenthaceae) in Brunei. ''Sandakania'' 11: 55–60.; and by Clarke and Kitching in 1993 and 1995,;Clarke, C.M. &amp; R.L. Kitching 1993. The Metazoan Food Webs from Six Bornean ''Nepenthes'' Species.

''Journal of Tropical Ecology'' 11(4): 589–602.; strongly support the mutualism theory.

The ants feed by descending into the pitcher fluid and retrieving arthropods caught by the plant. The ants seem to ignore smaller insects and only target larger prey items. Hauling food from the pitcher fluid to the peristome, a distance of no more than 5 cm, may take up to 12 hours.; In this way the contents of ''N. bicalcarata'' pitchers is controlled such that organic matter does not accumulate to the point of putrefaction, which can lead to the demise of pitcher infauna (which also appear to benefit the plant) and sometimes the pitcher itself.;;Hansen, E. 2001. [http://discovermagazine.com/2001/oct/featplants Where rocks sing, ants swim, and plants eat animals: finding members of the ''Nepenthes'' carnivorous plant family in Borneo]. ''Discover'' 22(10): 60–68.;

Research conducted by Dennis and Marlis Merbach has shown that ''C. schmitzi'' protect ''N. bicalcarata'' against pitcher-destroying weevils of the genus ''Alcidodes''.;Merbach, M., G. Zizka, B. Fiala, D. Merbach, W.E. Booth &amp; U. Maschwitz 2007. Why a carnivorous plant cooperates with an ant:- selective defense against pitcher-destroying weevils in the myrmecophytic pitcher plant ''Nepenthes bicalcarata'' Hook.f.. ''Ecotropica'' 13: 45–56.;;Merbach, M. &amp; D. Merbach 2002.''Forschung Frankfurt'' 2002(3): 74–77.;

The ants seem to favour upper pitchers and rarely colonise lower pitchers.;Clarke, C.M. 1997. The effects of pitcher dimorphism on the metazoan community of the carnivorous pitcher plant ''Nepenthes bicalcarata'' Hook.f.. ''Malayan Nature Journal'' 50: 149–157.; This is likely due to the fact that terrestrial traps are periodically submerged in water during heavy rains. Flooding of the ants' nest chamber could result in the death of the developing eggs, larvae, and pupae.;

''C. schmitzi'' nests solely in the tendrils of ''N. bicalcarata'' and rarely ventures onto other plants. The species is completely dependent on ''N. bicalcarata'' for food and wikt:domicile|domicile.; ''N. bicalcarata'', on the other hand, is able to survive and reproduce without the presence of the ants; it is a facultative mutualist. This being the case, there appear to be few mature plants over 2 metres in height not colonised by ''C. schmitzi''.;

John Thompson suggests that ''N. bicalcarata'' may be the only plant species that obtains nutrients through both insect capture and ant-hosting habits.;Thompson, J.H. 1981. Reverse animal-plant interactions: the evolution of insectivorous and ant-fed plants. ''Biological Journal of the Linnean Society'' 16: 147–155.;

Ecology and conservation status
Image:Bicalcarata-habitat(peatswamp).jpg|thumb|Natural habitat of ''N. bicalcarata''
''N. bicalcarata'' is endemic to Borneo. It is most common in the peat swamp forests of the western coast of the island, which stretch across Sarawak, Sabah, Kalimantan, and Brunei. There it often grows in the shade of the ubiquitous dipterocarp ''Shorea albida''.; ''N. bicalcarata'' also occurs in ''kerangas'' forest and has even been recorded from white sand heath forests in Sarawak and East Kalimantan.; The species is often sympatric with ''N. ampullaria'' in these habitats.;

Specimens growing in undisturbed peat swamp forest, where sunlight is greatly diffused and high humidity prevails, reach the largest dimensions.; ''N. bicalcarata'' has a shallow root system that only penetrates the top layer of peat and leaf litter, to a depth of about 25 cm. Below this, high concentrations of tannins and alkaloids render the substrate toxic.;

''N. bicalcarata'' is generally found below 300 m in altitude, although H. Hallier reported a single collection in 1894 from between 700 and 950 m above sea level.;Hallier, H. 1895. Ein neues ''Cypripedium'' aus Borneo. ''Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indië'' LIV: 450–452.;

The conservation status of ''N. bicalcarata'' is listed as Vulnerable on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species based on an assessment carried out in 2000.;Schnell, D., P. Catling, G. Folkerts, C. Frost, R. Gardner, ''et al.'' 2000. [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/39624/all ''Nepenthes bicalcarata'']. ''2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species''. IUCN 2006. Retrieved on 11 May 2006. Listed as Vulnerable (VU B1+2c v2.3).; In 1997, Charles Clarke informally classified the species as Near Threatened based on the IUCN criteria.; This agrees with the conservation status assigned to ''N. bicalcarata'' by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre.;Simpson, R.B. 1995. ''Nepenthes'' and Conservation. ''Curtis's Botanical Magazine'' 12: 111–118.;

Natural hybrids

The following natural hybrids involving ''N. bicalcarata'' have been recorded.

*''N. ampullaria'' &amp;times; ''N. bicalcarata'';
*(''N. ampullaria'' &amp;times; ''N. gracilis'') &amp;times; ''N. bicalcarata'' [=''N. &amp;times; trichocarpa'' &amp;times; ''N. bicalcarata'']
*''N. bicalcarata'' &amp;times; ''N. gracilis'' [=''Nepenthes &amp;times; cantleyi|N. &amp;times; cantleyi''];
*''N. bicalcarata'' &amp;times; ''N. mirabilis'' var. ''echinostoma'';
*''N. bicalcarata'' &amp;times; ''N. rafflesiana'';
*? (''N. bicalcarata'' &amp;times; ''N. rafflesiana'') &amp;times; ''N. mirabilis'' var. ''echinostoma'';

None of these hybrids are known to be colonised by ''C. schmitzi'' as is the parent species ''N. bicalcarata''.;

=''N. ampullaria'' &amp;times; ''N. bicalcarata''=

Lower pitcher of ''N. ampullaria'' × ''N. bicalcarata'' (cultivated)
Since ''N. ampullaria'' and ''N. bicalcarata'' are often sympatric in the wild, it is not surprising that they occasionally hybridise. Several examples of this natural hybrid are known from Brunei, where it grows in peat swamp forest and heath forest.; It was first recorded by Mitsuru Hotta in 1966.;Hotta, M. 1966. Notes on Bornean Plants. ''Acta Phytotaxonomica et Geobotanica'' 22(1–2): 7–9.;

Pitchers bear the characteristic thorns of ''N. bicalcarata'', although they are greatly reduced in size. The mouth is round and the lid is wikt:ovate|ovate-wikt:cordate|cordate in form. This hybrid resembles ''N. &amp;times; hookeriana'' to a certain extent, but differs in having spines on the underside of the lid and more globose upper pitchers with a smaller lid.;

Aerial pitchers of ''N. ampullaria'' &amp;times; ''N. bicalcarata'' are usually dominated by characteristics of ''N. ampullaria''. They are often very small and unable to function in a normal manner.;

=(''N. ampullaria'' &amp;times; ''N. gracilis'') &amp;times; ''N. bicalcarata''=

This rare complex hybrid was discovered in the lowland forests of Brunei. It produces small speckled pitchers with reduced thorns under the lid. The plant is intermediate in appearance between ''N. &amp;times; trichocarpa'' and ''N. bicalcarata''.

=''N. bicalcarata'' &amp;times; ''N. gracilis''=

Lower pitcher of ''Nepenthes × cantleyi''
This hybrid has been named ''Nepenthes × cantleyi|N. × cantleyi'' after Rob Cantley. The morphology of the pitchers closely resembles ''N. bicalacarata'', although the peristome is more similar to that of ''N. gracilis''. The characteristic spines of ''N. bicalcarata'' are greatly reduced and are only present as small bumps. This hybrid has the growth habit of ''N. gracilis'', with the stem scrambling along the ground. It grows in open, sandy areas. The pitcher fluid is notably acidic like that of ''N. gracilis'', with pH values as low as 1.82 being recorded.;

=''N. bicalcarata'' &amp;times; ''N. mirabilis'' var. ''echinostoma''=

This natural hybrid is rare and is only known from Brunei, where it involves ''N. mirabilis'' var. ''echinostoma''. It closely resembles ''N. bicalcarata'', although it differs from that species in having reduced thorns and a wider peristome. Unlike ''N. bicalcarata'', this hybrid inhabits open areas with sandy substrates.;

=''N. bicalcarata'' &amp;times; ''N. rafflesiana''=

This relatively rare natural hybrid is sometimes found growing among populations of ''N. bicalcarata'' and ''N. rafflesiana''. It is intermediate in form between its parent species.

=(''N. bicalcarata'' &amp;times; ''N. rafflesiana'') &amp;times; ''N. mirabilis'' var. ''echinostoma''=

Charles Clarke reported a single plant displaying characters intermediate in form between ''N. bicalcarata'', ''N. rafflesiana'' and ''N. mirabilis'' var. ''echinostoma'' growing among populations of these species. It is likely a complex hybrid, although this cannot be proven without the use of genetic testing.;

Cultivation and cultivars
Lower pitcher of a plant cultivated in Kuching, Sarawak.
''N. bicalcarata'' may be cultivated in a similar manner to other members of the genus, though it requires relatively hot and humid conditions.;D'Amato, P. 1998. ''The Savage Garden — Cultivating Carnivorous Plants''. Ten Speed Press, Berkley, California.;; It needs large pots to do well, and temporary halts in growth are often due to becoming root-bound.Re-potting to a larger pot will often result in a rapid size increase.Under satisfactory conditions, this plant will grow quite fast for a ''Nepenthes'', reaching a large size relatively rapidly.

Despite naturally occurring in peat swamp forests, ''N. bicalcarata'' has been successfully grown in a completely inorganic substrate consisting of one part each of Seramis® clay perls, lava gravel,and Lecaton® expanded clay perls.;Rischer, H. 2000. [http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/samples/v29n2p50_53.html Growing ''Nepenthes'' in a Completely Inorganic Substrate]. ''Carnivorous Plant Newsletter'' 29(2): 50–53.;

''N. bicalcarata'' has been artificially crossed with ''N. hirsuta''. A particularly robust-pitchered cultivar of this hybrid was named ''Nepenthes'' 'Hortulanus Otten', in honour of Karel Otten, former curator of the Botanic Garden in Ghent, Belgium.;Cook, D., J.H. Hummer, A. Vogel, O. Gluch &amp; C. Clayton 2004. [http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/Species/v33n1p19_22.html New Cultivars]. ''Carnivorous Plant Newsletter'' 33(1): 19–22.;

A cultivar of the artifical cross ''N. bicalcarata'' &amp;times; ''N. &amp;times; dyeriana'' was registered in 1988 under the name ''Nepenthes'' 'Nina Dodd'. It is named after a relative of Cliff Dodd, who created the hybrid.;Robinson, J.T. 1988. [http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/Species/v17n1p20.html New Cultivars]. ''Carnivorous Plant Newsletter'' 17(1): 20;

Two further cultivars of manmade hybrids involving ''N. bicalcarata'' have been named. These are ''Nepenthes'' 'Bella' ((''N. ampullaria'' &amp;times; ''N. bicalcarata'') &amp;times; ''N. truncata'') and ''Nepenthes'' 'Rapa' (''N. ampullaria'' &amp;times; ''N. bicalcarata'').;Fukatsu, Y. 1999. List of ''Nepenthes Hybrids''.; However, both of these names are not established, as they were published without a description.;
