Bengali or Bangla (Help:IPA|IPA: ) is an Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language of the eastern Indian subcontinent, evolved from the Magadhi Prakrit, Pāli and Sanskrit languages.

Bengali is native to the region of eastern South Asia known as Bengal, which comprises present day Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. With nearly 230 million total speakers, Bengali is one of the most spoken languages (ranking 5th; or 6th; in the world). 
Bengali is the primary language spoken in Bangladesh and is the second most spoken language in India.;;;; Along with Assamese, it is geographically the most eastern of the Indo-Iranian languages.

The Bengali language, with its long and rich literary tradition, serves to bind together a culturally diverse region.In 1952, when Bangladesh used to be East Pakistan, this strong sense of identity led to the Bengali Language Movement, in which several people braved bullets and died on February 21.This day has now been declared as the International Mother Language Day. 

History

Like other List of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, Bengali arose from the eastern Middle Indic languages of the Indian subcontinent. Magadhi Prakrit, the earliest recorded spoken language in the region and the language of the Buddha, had evolved into Ardhamagadhi (&quot;Half Magadhi&quot;) in the early part of the first millennium CE. Ardhamagadhi, as with all of the Prakrits of North India, began to give way to what are called Apabhramsa languages just before the turn of the first millennium.;; The local Apabhramsa language of the eastern subcontinent, Purvi Apabhramsa or Apabhramsa Abahatta, eventually evolved into regional dialects, which in turn formed three groups: the Bihari languages, the Oriya languages, and the Bengali-Assamese languages. Some argue for much earlier points of divergence—going back to even 500 CE;; but the language was not static; different varieties coexisted and authors often wrote in multiple dialects. For example, Magadhi Prakrit is believed to have evolved into Apabhramsa Abahatta around the 6th century which competed with Bengali for a period of time.;[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/A_0001.htm Abahattha] in ;

Usually three periods are identified in the history of Bengali:;; 
# Old Bengali (900/1000 CE–1400 CE)—texts include ''Charyapada'', devotional songs; emergence of pronouns ''Ami'', ''tumi'', etc; verb inflections -''ila'', -''iba'', etc. Oriya and Assamese branch out in this period.
# Middle Bengali (1400–1800 CE)—major texts of the period include Chandidas's ''Srikrishnakirtan''; elision of word-final ''ô'' sound; spread of compound verbs; Persian influence. Some scholars further divide this period into early and late middle periods.
# New Bengali (since 1800 CE)—shortening of verbs and pronouns, among other changes (e.g. ''tahar'' → ''tar'' &quot;his&quot;/&quot;her&quot;; ''koriyachhilô'' → ''korechhilo'' he/she had done).

Historically closer to Pāli|Pali, Bengali saw an increase in Sanskrit influence during the Middle Bengali (Chaitanya era), and also during the Bengal Renaissance. Of the modern Indo-European languages in South Asia, Bengali and Marathi maintain a largely Sanskrit vocabulary base while Hindi and others such as Punjabi are more influenced by Arabic and Persian. 

Shaheed Minar, or the Martyr's monument, in Dhaka, commemorates the struggle for the Bengali language
Until the 18th century, there was no attempt to document the grammar for Bengali. The first written Bengali dictionary/grammar, ''Vocabolario em idioma Bengalla, e Portuguez dividido em duas partes'', was written by the Portuguese missionary Manoel da Assumpcam between 1734 and 1742 while he was serving in Bhawal.;; Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, a British grammarian, wrote a modern Bengali grammar(''A Grammar of the Bengal Language (1778)'') that used Bengali types in print for the first time.;[http://banglapedia.org/HT/B_0137.htm Bangla language] in ; Raja Ram Mohan Roy, the great Bengali Reformer, also wrote a &quot;Grammar of the Bengali Language&quot; (1832).

During this period, the ''Choltibhasha'' form, using simplified inflections and other changes, was emerging from ''Shadhubhasha'' (older form) as the form of choice for written Bengali.;; 

Bengali was the focus, in 1951–52, of the Bengali Language Movement (''Bhasha Andolon'') in what was then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).;; Although Bengali speakers were more numerous in the population of Pakistan, Urdu was legislated as the sole national language. On February 21, 1952, protesting students and activists walked into military and police fire in Dhaka University and three young students and several others were killed. Subsequently, UNESCO has declared 21 February as International Mother Language Day. In a separate event in May 1961, police in Silchar, India, killed eleven people who were protesting legislation that mandated the use of the Assamese language.;;

Geographical distribution
The native geographic extent of Bengali 

Bengali is native to the region of eastern South Asia known as Bengal, which comprises Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. Around 98% of the total population of Bangladesh speak Bengali as a native language.;; There are also significant Bengali-speaking communities in immigrant populations in the Middle East, West and Malaysia. 

=Official status=
Bengali is the national and official language of Bangladesh and one of the 23 official languages recognised by the Republic of India.;; It is the official language of the state of West Bengal and the co-official language of the state of Tripura, Cachar,Karimganj and Hailakandi Districts of southern Assam and the union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Bengali speakers make the majority in Neil Island and Havelock Island. It was made an official language of Sierra Leone in order to honour the Bangladeshi peacekeeping force from the United Nations stationed there.;; It is also the co-official language of Assam, which has three predominantly Sylheti-speaking districts of southern Assam: Silchar, Karimganj, and Hailakandi.;; The national anthems of both India and Bangladesh were written in Bengali by Rabindranath Tagore.

=Dialects=


Regional variation in spoken Bengali constitutes a dialect continuum. Linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterjee grouped these dialects into four large clusters &amp;mdash; Radh, Banga, Kamarupa and Varendra;;[http://banglapedia.org/HT/B_0137.htm Bangla language] in ; but many alternative grouping schemes have also been proposed.;; The south-western dialects (Radh) form the basis of standard colloquial Bengali, while Bangali is the dominant dialect group in Bangladesh. In the dialects prevalent in much of eastern and south-eastern Bengal (Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka and Sylhet divisions of Bangladesh), many of the stops and affricates heard in West Bengal are pronounced as fricatives. Western palato-alveolar affricates চ [], ছ [], জcorrespond to eastern[], ছ় [],[]~. The influence of Tibeto-Burman languages on the phonology of Eastern Bengali is seen through the lack of nasalized vowels. Some variants of Bengali, particularly Chittagonian and Chakma Bengali, have contrastive tone; differences in the pitch of the speaker's voice can distinguish words.

Rajbangsi, Kharia Thar and Mal Paharia are closely related to Western Bengali dialects, but are typically classified as separate languages. Similarly, Hajong is considered a separate language, although it shares similarities to Northern Bengali dialects.;; 

During the standardization of Bengali in the late 19th and early 20th century, the cultural center of Bengal was its capital Kolkata (then Calcutta). What is accepted as the standard form today in both West Bengal and Bangladesh is based on the West-Central dialect of Nadia, a district located near Kolkata.;; There are cases where speakers of Standard Bengali in West Bengal will use a different word than a speaker of Standard Bengali in Bangladesh, even though both words are of native Bengali descent. For example, ''nun'' (salt) in the west corresponds to ''lôbon'' in the east.;

Spoken and literary varieties
Bengali exhibits diglossia between the written and spoken forms of the language. Two styles of writing, involving somewhat different vocabularies and syntax, have emerged:;;; ;
# ''Shadhubhasha'' (সাধু ''shadhu'' = 'chaste' or 'sage'; ভাষা ''bhasha'' = 'language') was the written language with longer verb inflections and more of a Sanskrit-derived (তৎসম ''tôtshôm'') vocabulary. Songs such as India's national anthem ''Jana Gana Mana'' (by Rabindranath Tagore) and national song ''Vande Mātaram'' (by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay) were composed in Shadhubhasha. However, use of ''Shadhubhasha'' in modern writing is negligible, except when it is used deliberately to achieve some effect. 
# ''Choltibhasha'' (চলতিভাষা ) or ''Cholitobhasha'' (চলিত ''cholito'' = 'current' or 'running') , known by linguists as ''Manno Cholit Bangla'' (Standard Current Bangla), is a written Bengali style exhibiting a preponderance colloquial idiom and shortened verb forms, and is the standard for written Bengali now. This form came into vogue towards the turn of the 19th century, promoted by the writings of Peary Chand Mitra (''Alaler Gharer Dulal'', 1857),;; Pramatha Chowdhury (''Sabujpatra'', 1914) and in the later writings of Rabindranath Tagore. It is modeled on the dialect spoken in the Shantipur region in Nadia district, West Bengal. This form of Bengali is often referred to as the &quot;Nadia standard&quot; or &quot;Shantipuri bangla&quot;.;; 
Linguistically, cholit bangla is derived from sadhu bangla through two successive standard linguistic transformations.

While most writings are carried out in cholit bangla, spoken dialects exhibit a far greater variety. South-eastern West Bengal, including Kolkata, speak in manno cholit bangla. Other parts of West Bengal and west Bangladesh speak in dialects that are minor variations, such as the Medinipur dialect characterised by some unique words and constructions. However, areas of Bangladesh, particularly the Chittagong region, speak in a dialect that bears very little superficial resemblance to manno cholit bangla, including an entirely different vocabulary. The difference is so much that a person from West Bengal will be very hard pressed to understand even a single sentence in a passage of this dialect. This is known as the Bongali sublanguage, or more informally as Chattagram bangla. Writers (such as Manik Bandopadhyay in Padmanodir Majhi) have used the Bongali dialect in writing conversations. Though formal spoken Bengali is modeled on manno cholit bangla, the majority of Bengalis are able to communicate in more than one variety &amp;mdash; often, speakers are fluent in choltibhasha and one or more Regional dialects.;

Even in Standard Bengali, vocabulary items often divide along the split between the Muslim populace and the Hindu populace. Due to cultural and religious traditions, Hindus and Muslims might use, respectively, Sanskrit-derived and Perso-Arabic words. Some examples of lexical alternation between these two forms are:;;

* hello: nômoshkar (S) corresponds to assalamualaikum/slamalikum (A)
* invitation: nimontron/nimontonno (S) corresponds to daoat (A)
* paternal uncle: kaka (S) corresponds to chacha (S/Hindi)
* water : jol (D) corresponds to pani (S)
(here S = derived from Sanskrit, D = deshi; A = derived from Arabic)

Writing system

''Anandabazar Patrika'', a news daily published from Kolkata in Bengali.

The Bengali writing system is not purely alphabet-based such as the Latin script. Rather, it is written in the Bengali abugida, a variant of the Eastern Nagari script used throughout Bangladesh and eastern India. It is believed to have evolved from a modified Brahmic script around 1000 CE,;[http://banglapedia.org/HT/B_0140.htm Bangla Script] in ; and is similar to the Devanagari abugida used for Sanskrit and many modern Indo-Aryan languages|Indic languages such as Hindi. It has particularly close historical relationships with the Assamese script and the Oriya script (although the latter is not evident in appearance). The Bengali abugida is a cursive script with eleven graphemes or signs denoting the independent form of nine vowels and two diphthongs, and thirty-nine signs denoting the consonants with the so called &quot;inherent&quot; vowels.;[http://banglapedia.org.bd/HT/B_0140.htm Bangla Script] in ; The concept of capitalization is absent in Bengali writing system. There is no variation in initial, medial and final forms as in the Arabic script. The letters run from left to right on a horizontal line, and spaces are used to separate orthographic words.

Although the consonant signs are presented as segments in the basic inventory of the Bengali script,they are actually orthographically syllabic in nature. Every consonant sign has the vowel অ(or sometimes the vowel ও ) &quot;embedded&quot; or &quot;inherent&quot; in it.;; For example, the basic consonant sign ম is pronouncedin isolation. The same ম can represent the soundsorwhen used in a word, as in মত&quot;opinion&quot; and মন&quot;mind&quot;, respectively, with no added symbol for the vowelsand . 

A consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other thanis orthographically realized by using a variety of vowel allographs above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel ligature. These allographs, called ''kar''s (cf. Hindi ''matra''s) are dependent vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph মিrepresents the consonantfollowed by the vowel , whereis represented as the allograph ি and is placed ''before'' the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs মা , মী , মু , মূ , মৃ , মে /, মৈ , মোand মৌrepresent the same consonant ম combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. It should be noted that in these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called &quot;inherent&quot; vowel is expunged from the consonant, but the basic consonant sign ম does not indicate this change.

To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the ''hôshonto'' (্‌), may be added below the basic consonant sign (as in ম্‌ ). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. 

Three other commonly used diacritics in the Bengali are the superposed ''chôndrobindu'' (ঁ), denoting a suprasegmental for nasalization of vowels (as in চাঁদ&quot;moon&quot;), the postposed ''onushshôr'' (ং)indicating the velar nasal(as in বাংলা&quot;Bengali&quot;) and the postposed ''bishôrgo'' (ঃ) indicating the voiceless glottal fricative(as in উঃ!&quot;ouch!&quot;). 

The vowel signs in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant,the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in মই&quot;ladder&quot; and in ইলিশ&quot;Hilsa fish&quot;, the independent form of the vowel ই is used (cf. the dependent form ি). A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realized using its independent form.

The Bengali consonant clusters (যুক্তাক্ষর ''juktakkhor'' in Bengali) are usually realized as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. There are more than 400 such consonant clusters and corresponding ligatures in Bengali. Many of their shapes have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more &quot;transparent&quot; graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognize both the new &quot;transparent&quot; and the old &quot;opaque&quot; forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.

Bengali punctuation marks, apart from the ''daŗi'' (|), the Bengali equivalent of a full stop, have been adopted from Western scripts and their usage is similar. ;[http://banglapedia.org/HT/B_0137.htm Bangla language] in ;

Whereas in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms hang from a visible horizontal headstroke called the ''matra'' (not to be confused with its Hindi cognate ''matra'', which denotes the dependent forms of Hindi vowels). The presence and absence of this ''matra'' can be important. For example, the letter তand the numeral ৩ &quot;3&quot; are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster ত্রand the independent vowel এ . The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible ''matra'' and an invisible baseline).

Signature of Rabindranath Tagore &amp;mdash; an example of penmanship in Bengali. 

=Spelling-to-pronunciation inconsistencies=
In spite of some modifications in the nineteenth century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,;[http://banglapedia.org/HT/B_0137.htm Bangla language] in ; and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters (শ, ষ, and স) for the voiceless palato-alveolar fricative , although the letter স does retain the voiceless alveolar fricativesound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in স্খলন&quot;fall&quot;, স্পন্দন&quot;beat&quot;, etc. There are two letters (জ and য) for the voiced postalveolar affricateas well. What was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal ণis now pronounced as an alveolar(unless conjoined with another retroflex consonant such as ট, ঠ, ড and ঢ), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The near-open front unrounded vowelis orthographically realized bymultiple means, as seen in the following examples: এত&quot;so much&quot;, এ্যাকাডেমী&quot;academy&quot;, অ্যামিবা&quot;amoeba&quot;, দেখা&quot;to see&quot;, ব্যস্ত&quot;busy&quot;, ব্যাকরণ&quot;grammar&quot;. 

The realization of the inherent vowel can be another source of confusion. The vowel can be phonetically realized asordepending on the word, and its omission is seldom indicated, as in the final consonant in কম&quot;less&quot;.

Many consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants ক্‌and ষis graphically realized as ক্ষ and is pronounced(as in রুক্ষ&quot;rugged&quot;) or(as in ক্ষতি&quot;loss&quot;) or even(as in ক্ষমতা&quot;power&quot;), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.

For a detailed list of these inconsistencies, consult Bengali script.

=Uses in other languages=
The Bengali script, with a few small modifications, is also used for writing Assamese. Other related languages in the region also make use of the Bengali alphabet. Meitei, a Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language used in the Indian state of Manipur, has been written in the Bengali abugida for centuries, though Meitei Mayek (the Meitei abugida) has been promoted in recent times. The script has been adopted for writing the Sylheti language as well, replacing the use of the old Sylheti Nagori script.;;

=Romanization=


Several conventions exist for writing Indic languages including Bengali in the Latin script, including &quot;International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration&quot; or IAST (based on diacritics),;; &quot;Indian languages Transliteration&quot; or ITRANS (uses upper case alphabets suited for ASCII keyboards),;; and the National Library at Calcutta romanization.;;

In the context of Bangla Romanization, it is important to distinguish between 
transliteration from transcription.Transliteration is orthographically accurate
(i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas 
transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation
can be reproduced).
Since English does not have the sounds of Bangla, and since pronunciation does not completely reflect the spellings, being faithful to both is not possible. 

Although it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bangla orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bangla words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia mixed a phonemic transcription, where the pronunciation is represented with no reference to how it is written. The Wikipedia Romanization is given in the table below, with the help:IPA|IPA transcriptions as used above.

=Diphthongs=
Magadhan languages such as Bengali are known for their wide variety of diphthongs, or combinations of vowels occurring within the same syllable.;; Several vowel combinations can be considered true monosyllabic diphthongs, made up of the main vowel (the nucleus) and the trailing vowel (the off-glide). Almost all other vowel combinations are possible, but only across two adjacent syllables, such as the disyllabic vowel combinationin কুয়া ''kua'' &quot;well&quot;. As many as 25 vowel combinations can be found, but some of the more recent combinations have not passed through the stage between two syllables and a diphthongal monosyllable.;;

=Stress=
In standard Bengali, stress is predominantly initial. Bengali words are virtually all trochaic; the primary stress falls on the initial syllable of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as ''shô-ho-jo-gi-ta'' &quot;cooperation&quot;, where the boldface represents primary and secondary stress. The first syllable carries the greatest stress, with the third carrying a somewhat weaker stress, and all following odd-numbered syllables carrying very weak stress. However in words borrowed from Sanskrit, the root syllable is stressed, causing them to be out of harmony with native Bengali words.;;

Adding prefixes to a word typically shifts the stress to the left. For example, while the word ''shob-bho'' &quot;civilized&quot; carries the primary stress on the first syllable [shob], adding the negative prefix [ô-] creates ''ô-shob-bho'' &quot;uncivilized&quot;, where the primary stress is now on the newly-added first syllable অ ''ô''. In any case, word-stress does not alter the meaning of a word and is always subsidiary to sentence-stress.;;

=Intonation=
For Bengali words, intonation or pitch of voice has minor significance, apart from a few isolated cases. However in sentences intonation does play a significant role.;; In a simple declarative sentence, most words and/or phrases in Bengali carry a rising tone,;; with the exception of the last word in the sentence, which only carries a low tone. This intonational pattern creates a musical tone to the typical Bengali sentence, with low and high tones alternating until the final drop in pitch to mark the end of the sentence.

In sentences involving focused words and/or phrases, the rising tones only last until the focused word; all following words carry a low tone.;; This intonation pattern extends to wh-questions, as wh-words are normally considered to be focused. In yes-no questions, the rising tones may be more exaggerated, and most importantly, the final syllable of the final word in the sentence takes a high falling tone instead of a flat low tone.;;

=Vowel length=
Vowel length is not contrastive in Bengali; all else equal, there is no meaningful distinction between a &quot;short vowel&quot; and a &quot;long vowel&quot;,;; unlike the situation in many other Indic languages. However, when morpheme boundaries come into play, vowel length can sometimes distinguish otherwise homophonous words. This is due to the fact that open monosyllables (i.e. words that are made up of only one syllable, with that syllable ending in the main vowel and not a consonant) have somewhat longer vowels than other syllable types.;; For example, the vowel in ''cha:'' &quot;tea&quot; is somewhat longer than the first vowel in ''chaţa'' &quot;licking&quot;, as ''cha:'' is a word with only one syllable, and no final consonant. (The long vowel is marked with a colon : in these examples.) The suffix ''ţa'' &quot;the&quot; can be added to ''cha:'' to form ''cha:ţa'' &quot;the tea&quot;. Even when another morpheme is attached to ''cha:'', the long vowel is preserved. Knowing this fact, some interesting cases of apparent vowel length distinction can be found. In general Bengali vowels tend to stay away from extreme vowel articulation.;;

Furthermore, using a form of reduplication called &quot;echo reduplication&quot;, the long vowel in ''cha:'' can be copied into the reduplicant ''ţa:'', giving ''cha:ţa:'' &quot;tea and all that comes with it&quot;. Thus, in addition to ''cha:ţa'' &quot;the tea&quot; (long first vowel) and ''chaţa'' &quot;licking&quot; (no long vowels), we have ''cha:ţa:'' &quot;tea and all that comes with it&quot; (both long vowels).

=Consonant clusters=


Native Bengali (''tôdbhôb'') words do not allow initial consonant clusters;;; the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side). Many speakers of Bengali restrict their phonology to this pattern, even when using Sanskrit or English borrowings, such as গেরাম ''geram'' (CV.CVC) for গ্রাম ''gram'' (CCVC) &quot;village&quot; or ইস্কুল ''iskul'' (VC.CVC) for স্কুল ''skul'' (CCVC) &quot;school&quot;.

Sanskrit (তৎসম ''tôtshôm'') words borrowed into Bengali, however, possess a wide range of clusters, expanding the maximum syllable structure to CCCVC. Some of these clusters, such as the ''mr'' in মৃত্যু ''mrittu'' &quot;death&quot; or the ''sp'' in স্পষ্ট ''spôshţo'' &quot;clear&quot;, have become extremely common, and can be considered legal consonant clusters in Bengali. English and other foreign (বিদেশী ''bideshi'') borrowings add even more cluster types into the Bengali inventory, further increasing the syllable capacity to CCCVCCCC, as commonly-used loanwords such as ট্রেন ''ţren'' &quot;train&quot; and গ্লাস ''glash'' &quot;glass&quot; are now even included in leading Bengali dictionaries.

Final consonant clusters are rare in Bengali.;; Most final consonant clusters were borrowed into Bengali from English, as in লিফ্‌ট ''lifţ'' &quot;lift, elevator&quot; and ব্যাংক ''bêņk'' &quot;bank&quot;. However, final clusters do exist in some native Bengali words, although rarely in standard pronunciation. One example of a final cluster in a standard Bengali word would be গঞ্জ ''gônj'', which is found in names of hundreds of cities and towns across Bengal, including নবাবগঞ্জ ''Nôbabgônj'' and মানিকগঞ্জ ''Manikgônj''. Some nonstandard varieties of Bengali make use of final clusters quite often. For example, in some Purbo (eastern) dialects, final consonant clusters consisting of a nasal and its corresponding oral stop are common, as in চান্দ ''chand'' &quot;moon&quot;. The Standard Bengali equivalent of ''chand'' would be চাঁদ ''chãd'', with a nasalized vowel instead of the final cluster.

Grammar


Bengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives (inflection). However, nouns and pronouns are highly declined (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four cases while verbs are heavily conjugated.

As a consequence, unlike Hindi, Bengali verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.

=Word order=
As a Head-Final language, Bengali follows Subject Object Verb word order, although variations to this theme are common.;; Bengali makes use of postpositions, as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. Determiners follow the noun, while numerals, adjectives, and possessors precede the noun.;;

Yes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) tone of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally optional particles (e.g. কি ''-ki'', না ''-na'', etc.) are often encliticized onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.

Wh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to focus position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.

=Nouns=
Nouns and pronouns are inflected for case, including nominative, objective, genitive (possessive), and locative.;; The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of animacy. When a definite article such as -টা ''-ţa'' (singular) or -গুলা ''-gula'' (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for number.

When counted, nouns take one of a small set of measure words. As in many East Asian languages (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Thai, etc.), nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. The noun's measure word (MW) must be used between the numeral and the noun. Most nouns take the generic measure word -টা ''-ţa'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. -জন ''-jon'' for humans).

Measuring nouns in Bengali without their corresponding measure words (e.g. আট বিড়াল ''aţ biŗal'' instead of আটটা বিড়াল ''aţ-ţa biŗal'' &quot;eight cats&quot;) would typically be considered ungrammatical. However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. শুধু একজন থাকবে। ''Shudhu êk-jon thakbe.'' (lit. &quot;Only one-MW will remain.&quot;) would be understood to mean &quot;Only one person will remain.&quot;, given the semantic class implicit in -জন ''-jon''.

In this sense, all nouns in Bengali, unlike most other Indo-European languages, are similar to mass nouns.

=Verbs=
Verbs divide into two classes: finite and non-finite. Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for person (first, second, third), tense (present, past, future), aspect (simple, perfect, progressive), and honor (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. Conditional, imperative, and other special inflections for mood can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200. 

Inflectional suffixes in the morphology of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in syntax. 

Bengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the zero copula, where the copula or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.;[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/B_0137.htm Bangla language] in ; Thus &quot;he is a teacher&quot; is ''she shikkhôk'', (literally &quot;he teacher&quot;).;Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkhôk hochchhe''. This is viewed as ungrammatical by other speakers, and speakers of this variety are sometimes (humorously) referred as &quot;hochchhe-Bangali&quot;.; 
In this respect, Bengali is similar to Russian and Hungarian.

Vocabulary
Sources of Bengali words|180px|right


Bengali has as many as 100,000 separate words, of which 50,000 (67%) are considered ''tôtshômo'' (direct reborrowings from Sanskrit), 21,100 (28%) are ''tôdbhôbo'' (derived from Sanskrit words), and the rest being ''bideshi'' (foreign) and ''deshi'' words.

However, these figures do not take into account the fact that a large proportion of these words are archaic or highly technical, minimizing their actual usage. The productive vocabulary used in modern literary works, in fact, is made up mostly (67%) of ''tôdbhôbo'' words, while ''tôtshômo'' only make up 25% of the total.;[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/T_0087.htm Tatsama] in ;;[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/T_0010.htm Tatbhava] in ; ''Deshi'' and ''Bideshi'' words together make up the remaining 8% of the vocabulary used in modern Bengali literature.

Due to centuries of contact with Europeans, Mughals, Arabs, Turks, Persians, Afghans, and East Asians, Bengali has borrowed many words from foreign languages. The most common borrowings from foreign languages come from three different kinds of contact. Close contact with neighboring peoples facilitated the borrowing of words from Hindi, Assamese, Chinese, Burmese, and several indigenous Austroasiatic languages (like Santali).;Byomkes Chakrabarti ''A Comparative Study of Santali and Bengali'', K.P. Bagchi &amp; Co., Kolkata, 1994, ISBN 8170741289 ; of Bengal. After centuries of invasions from Persia and the Middle East, numerous Persian, Arabic, Turkish, and Pashtun words were absorbed into Bengali. Portuguese, French, Dutch and English words were later additions during the colonial period.
