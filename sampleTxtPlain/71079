Rainbow flags in various cultures and movements
=Early European history=
The use of rainbow flags as a sign of diversity, inclusiveness, hope and of yearning has a long history. This denotation goes back to the rainbow as a symbol of biblical promise, when God used the rainbow as a sign to Noah that there would never be a flood like the one that happened.;[http://christianity.about.com/od/symbolspictures/ig/Christian-Symbols-Glossary/Christian-Rainbow.htm Christian symbols Glossary];;[http://goodnewspirit.com/rainbow.htm Symbol of God's Everlasting Covenant with Mankind]; The reformer Thomas Müntzer (1489-1525) connected socially revolutionary claims with his preaching of the gospel. He is often portrayed with a rainbow flag in his hand. The Thomas Müntzer statue in the German town of Stolberg, Saxony-Anhalt|Stolberg also shows him holding a rainbow flag in his hand.

In the German Peasants' War of the 16th century, the rainbow flag together with the peasants' boot (&quot;Bundschuh&quot;) was used as the sign of a new era, of hope and of social change.

=South America (Pre-Columbian)=
Wiphala

A flag with a seven-striped rainbow design is used in Peru ;[http://flagspot.net/flags/xi.html Flagspot.net]; and Ecuador to represent Tawantin Suyu, or Inca territory. The use of the flag has its origin in Inca culture and it is called whipala. Even today in the city of Cusco, Peru it is common to see the flag around the city displayed even in government buildings and in Cusco main square. The meaning behind the whipala has to be found in connection with the Incas and with the cosmovision and philosophy of Andean indigenous culture.

Some argue that there is no historical reference to an Inca or Tawantisuyo flag or banner until the early 1920s; but other specialists suggest that there are chronicles and some references that support the idea of a banner attributable to the Inca. In 1534 during the invasion and occupation of the city of Qusqu today Cusco, the Spaniards found the first resistance of qhishwa-ayrnaras and saw between the multitude, objects similar to the flag of strips and pictures of seven colors of the rainbow. The existence and the use of this emblem probably has been from the same creation of Tiwanaku for more than 2000 years. ;[http://www.indigenas.bioetica.org/wiphala.htm History of Wiphala]; ;[http://www.backspace.com/notes/2005/06/ Social Design Notes: The Wiphala];

=Buddhism (1880)=
Buddhist flag

Tibetan prayer flags are colourful panels or rectangular cloths strung along mountain ridges and peaks in the Himalayas to bless the surrounding countryside. In the United States, multi-coloured flags often represent the Buddhist community. While Tibetan prayer flags are much older, the Buddhist flag was designed in 1880. ;[http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/general_symbols_buddhism.html Buddhist Symbols];

=Cooperative movement (1921)=
International Co-operative Alliance
A seven-colour rainbow flag is a common symbol of the international Cooperative movement. The rainbow flag has been the co-operative emblem since 1921 when the International Co-operative Congress of World Co-op Leaders met in Basel, Switzerland to identify and define the growing co-operative movement’s common values and ideals to help unite co-ops around the world.

In Essen, Germany in 1922, the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) designed an international co-op symbol and a flag for the first &quot;Co-operators' Day,&quot; which was held in July 1923. After some experiments with different designs, a famous French co-operator, Professor Charles Gide, suggested using the seven colours of the rainbow for the flag. He pointed out that the rainbow symbolized unity in diversity and the power of light, enlightenment and progress. The first co-op rainbow flag was completed in 1924 and was adopted as an official symbol of the international co-operative movement in 1925.

The ICA has been flying a flag with its official logo since April 2001, when its Board decided to replace the traditional rainbow flag. Its use by a number of non-cooperative groups led to confusion in several countries around the world. The ICA's official flag was changed to clearly promote and strengthen the co-operative image, but still uses the rainbow image. Other organizations sometimes use the traditional rainbow flag as a symbol of co-operation.

Like the rainbow, this flag is a symbol of hope and peace. The seven colours from flags around the world fly in harmony. Each of the seven colours in the co-operative flag have been assigned the following meaning: ;[http://www.ica.coop/ica/index.html Official website of ICA];
* red: stands for courage;
* orange: offers the vision of possibilities;
* yellow: represents the challenge that GREEN has kindled;
* green: indicates a challenge to co-operators to strive for growth of membership and of understanding of the aims and values of co-operation;
* sky blue: suggests far horizons, the need to provide education and help less fortunate people and strive toward global unity.
* dark blue: suggests pessimism: a reminder that less fortunate people have needs that may be met through the benefits of cooperation.
* violet: represents warmth, beauty, and friendship.

=Meher Baba (1924)=

It is flown each year near his samadhi (tomb-shrine) in Meherabad, India during the week of Amartithi (the anniversary of his death on January 31, 1969). Baba explained the symbolism, saying, &quot;The colors in the flag signify man's rise from the grossest of impressions of lust and anger – symbolized by red – to the culmination in the highest state of spirituality and oneness with God – symbolized by sky blue.&quot; ; ''Lord Meher'', by Bhau Kalchuri, Manifestation Inc. 1986, p. 618; ;[http://www.jaibaba.com/babaflag.html The History of Meher Baba's Rainbow Flag];

=Peace movement (1961)=
PACE flag (Italian for 'peace')


This rainbow flag in Italy was first used in a peace march in 1961, inspired by similar multi-coloured flags used in demonstrations against nuclear weapons.

The most common variety has seven colours, purple, blue, azure, green, yellow, orange and red, and is emblazoned in bold with the Italian word ''PACE'', meaning &quot;peace&quot;. ;[http://www.bandieredipace.org/ Bandiere di Pace.org] ('Flags of Peace' in Italian); ;[http://www.amnesty.no/web.nsf/pages/494DD08999FC10CEC1256D3D00328635 Amnesty International];
