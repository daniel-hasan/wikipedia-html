Reelin is a protein found mainly in the brain, but also in the spinal cord, blood and other body organs and tissues. Reelin is crucial for regulating the processes of Neural development#Neuronal Migration|neuronal migration and positioning in the developing brain.
Besides this important role in the early period, reelin continues to work in the adult brain. It modulates the synaptic plasticity by enhancing Long-term potentiation|LTP induction and maintenance.;;Weeber, E. J., U. Beffert, C. Jones, J. M. Christian, E. Forster, J. D. Sweatt, and J. Herz. 2002. ''Reelin and ApoE receptors cooperate to enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning.'' J. Biol. Chem. 277:39944-39952. PMID 12167620;;D'Arcangelo G. (2005) ''Apoer2: a reelin receptor to remember.'' Neuron. 47(4):471-3. PMID 16102527; It also stimulates dendrite development;;Niu S, Renfro A, Quattrocchi CC, Sheldon M, D’Arcangelo G. (2004) ''Reelin promotes hippocampal dendrite development through the VLDLR/ApoER2-Dab1 pathway.'' Neuron. 2004 Jan 8;41(1):71-84. PMID 14715136 ;; and regulates the continuing migration of neuroblasts generated in adult neurogenesis sites like subventricular and subgranular zones.

Reelin is implicated in pathogenesis of several brain diseases: significantly lowered expression of the protein have been found in schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder. Total lack of reelin causes a form of lissencephaly; reelin also may play a role in Alzheimer's disease, temporal lobe epilepsy, and autism. 

Reelin's name comes from the abnormal reeling gait of ''reeler'' mice,;;Falconer DS (1951) ''2 new mutants, trembler and reeler, with neurological actions in the house mouse (mus-musculus l)'' Journal of Genetics 50 (2): 192-201 [http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/external_ref?access_num=A1951XX17400002&amp;link_type=ISI];; which were found to have a deficiency of this brain protein and were homozygous for the RELN gene, which encodes reelin synthesis. 
The primary phenotype associated with loss of reelin function is inverted cortex, a neuroanatomical defect in which the six cortical layers are inverted.Heterozygous mice for the reelin gene have very little obvious neuroanatomical defect but those that they have resemble the changes of the human schizophrenic brain.

History

Mutant mice provide insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of the development of the CNS. These spontaneous mutations were first identified by scientists interested in motor behavior, and it proved relatively easy to screen litter mates for mice that showed difficulties moving around the cage. A number of such mice were found and given descriptive names such as reeler, weaver, lurcher, nervous, and staggerer.

The &quot;reeler&quot; mouse was first described in the 1951 edition of Journal of Genetics by Douglas Scott Falconer.; Histopathological studies in the 1960's revealed that the reeler cerebellum is dramatically decreased in size and the normal laminar organization found in several brain regions is disrupted.; Hamburgh M. (1963) Analysis of the postnatal developmental effects of &quot;reeler&quot;, a neurological mutation in mice. A study in developmental genetics. Dev Biol. 19:165-85. PMID 14069672 ; 1970's brought the discovery of cellular layers inversion in the mice neocortex;Caviness VS Jr. (1976) ''Patterns of cell and fiber distribution in the neocortex of the reeler mutant mouse.'' J Comp Neurol. 170(4):435-47. PMID 1002868;, which attracted more attention to the reeler mutation. 

In 1995, the RELN gene and protein were discovered at chromosome 7q22 by Gabriella D'Arcangelo and colleagues;D'Arcangelo G, Miao GG, Chen SC, Soares HD, Morgan JI, Curran T (1995) A protein related to extracellular matrix proteins deleted in the mouse mutant reeler. Nature 374: 719-723. PMID 7715726;. Almost immediately,Japanese scientists at Kochi Medical School had successfully created the first monoclonal antibody for reelin, called CR-50.;Ogawa M, Miyata T, Nakajima K, Yagyu K, Seike M, Ikenaka K, Yamamoto H, Mikoshiba K. (1995) The reeler gene-associated antigen on Cajal-Retzius neurons is a crucial molecule for laminar organization of cortical neurons. Neuron. 14(5):899-912. PMID 7748558; They noted that CR-50 reacted specifically with Cajal-Retzius cell|Cajal-Retzius neurons, whose functional role was unknown till then. 

The downstream pathway of Reelin was clarified using other mutant mice, including yotari and scrambler. These mice have phenotypes similar to that of reeler but have no mutation in reelin. It was then demonstrated that the mouse ''disabled homologue 1'' (Dab1) gene, which encodes a homolog of ''Drosophila disabled'', is the gene responsible for the phenotypes of these mutant mice, and Dab1 protein was absent (yotari) or only barely (scrambler) detectable in these mutants.;Sheldon M, Rice DS, D'Arcangelo G, Yoneshima H, Nakajima K, Mikoshiba K, Howell BW, Cooper JA, Goldowitz D, Curran T. (1997) Scrambler and yotari disrupt the disabled gene and produce a reeler-like phenotype in mice. Nature. 389(6652):730-3. PMID 9338784 ; Targeted disruption of Dab1 also caused a phenotype similar to that of reeler.

The Reelin receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and very-low-density lipoprotein receptor, were discovered serendipitously by Trommsdorff et al, who found that the double knockout mice for apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and very-low-density lipoprotein receptor, which they generated for another experiment, showed defects in cortical layering similar to that in reeler.;Trommsdorff M, Gotthardt M, Hiesberger T, Shelton J, Stockinger W, Nimpf J, Hammer RE, Richardson JA, Herz J. (1997) Reeler/Disabled-like disruption of neuronal migration in knockout mice lacking the VLDL receptor and ApoE receptor 2. Cell. 97(6):689-701. PMID 10380922;

In the July of 2006, a group of Japanese scientists published the first report of X-ray crystallography and electron tomography investigation of reelin structure.;

Secretion and localization of reelin

Studies show that Reelin is absent from synaptic vesicles and is secreted via constitutive secretory pathway, being stored in Golgi secretory vesicles.;Lacor PN, Grayson DR, Auta J, Sugaya I, Costa E, Guidotti A. (2000) ''Reelin secretion from glutamatergic neurons in culture is independent from neurotransmitter regulation.'' Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 97(7):3556-61. PMID 10725375 [http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=10725375 free full text]; Reelin's release rate is not regulated by depolarization, but strictly depends on its synthesis rate. This relationship is similar to that reported for the secretion of other ECM proteins.

In the cortex and hippocampus, reelin is secreted by Cajal-Retzius cells, Cajal cells, and Retzius cells during brain development.;;Meyer G, Goffinet AM, Fairen A. (1999) ''What is a Cajal-Retzius cell? A reassessment of a classical cell type based on recent observations in the developing neocortex.'' Cereb Cortex. 9(8):765-75.

Structure

Reelin is a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein composed of 3461 amino acids with a relative molecular mass of 388 kDa.

Reelin molecule starts with a signaling peptide 27 amino acids in length, followed by a region bearing similarity to F-spondin, marked as &quot;SP&quot; on the scheme, and by a region unique to reelin, marked as &quot;H&quot;. Next come the 8 repeats of 300-350 amino acids. These are called ''reelin repeats'' and have an EGF motif at their center, dividing each repeat into two subrepeats, ''A'' and ''B''. Despite this interruption, the two subdomains make direct contact, resulting in a compact overall structure.;;Nogi T, Yasui N, Hattori M, Iwasaki K, Takagi J. (2006) ''Structure of a signaling-competent reelin fragment revealed by X-ray crystallography and electron tomography.'' EMBO Journal. PMID 16858396;

The last comes a highly basic and short C-terminal region (CTR, marked &quot;+&quot;) with a length of 32 amino acids. This region is extremely conservative, being 100% identical in all investigated mammals. It was thought that CTR is necessary for reelin secretion, because Orleans reeler mutation, which lacks a part of 8th repeat and the whole CTR, is unable to secrete the misshaped protein, leading to its concentration in cytoplasm. However, one recent study has shown that the CTR is not essential for secretion, which is most probably hindered then reelin is cut along one of the repeats.;;Nakano Y, Kohno T, Hibi T, Kohno S, Baba A, Mikoshiba K, Nakajima K, Hattori M. (2007) ''The extremely conserved C-terminal region of reelin is not necessary for secretion but is required for efficient activation of downstream signaling.'' The Journal of Biological Chemistry. 2007 May 15; PMID 17504759 [http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/M702300200v1 free full text];;

Reelin is cleaved ''in vivo'' at two sites located after domains 2 and 6 - approximately between repeats 2 and 3 and between repeats 6 and 7, resulting in the production of three fragments.;;Lambert de Rouvroit C, de Bergeyck V, Cortvrindt C, Bar I, Eeckhout Y, Goffinet AM.(1999) ''Reelin, the extracellular matrix protein deficient in reeler mutant mice, is processed by a metalloproteinase.'' Exp Neurol. 156(1):214-7. PMID 10192793;; This splitting does not decrease the protein's activity, as constructs made of the predicted central fragments (repeats 3–6) bind to lipoprotein receptors, trigger Dab1 phosphorylation and mimic functions of reelin during cortical plate development.;;Jossin, Y., Ignatova, N., Hiesberger, T., Herz, J., Lambert de Rouvroit, C. &amp; Goffinet, A.M. (2004) ''The central fragment of Reelin, generated by proteolytic processing in vivo, is critical to its function during cortical plate development.'' J. Neurosci., 24, 514–521. PMID 14724251 ([http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/24/2/514 free full text]);

Function and mechanism of action
In the process of neural development, Reelin acts on migrating neuronal precursors and controls correct cell positioning in the cortex and other brain structures. The proposed role is one of a dissociation signal for neuronal groups, allowing them to separate and go from tangential chain-migration to radial individual migration.;;Hack I, Bancila M, Loulier K, Carroll P, Cremer H. (2002) ''Reelin is a detachment signal in tangential chain-migration during postnatal neurogenesis.'' Nature Neuroscience 5(10):939-45. PMID 12244323 ;; Dissociation detaches migrating neurons from the glial cells that are acting as their guides, converting them into individual cells that can strike out alone to find their final position.

In the adult brain, Reelin plays an important role by modulating cortical pyramidal neuron dendritic spine expression density, the branching of dendrites, and the expression of long-term potentiation. 

=Mechanism of action=
Reelin acts on two receptors:
* VLDLR (very-low-density lipoprotein receptor) and the 
* ApoER2 (apolipoprotein E receptor 2), 
which are members of the :Category:low density lipoprotein receptor gene family|Low density lipoprotein receptor gene family.

The intracellular adaptor DAB1 binds to the VLDLR and ApoER2 through an NPxY motif and is involved in transmission of Reelin signals through these lipoprotein receptors.

The proposal that the protocadherin CNR1 behaves as a Reelin receptor;;Senzaki K, Ogawa M, Yagi T. (1999) ''Proteins of the CNR family are multiple receptors for Reelin.'' Cell. 99(6):635-47. PMID 10612399; has been disproved.;;

It has been shown that alpha-3-beta-1 integrin binds to the N-terminal region of reelin, a site distinct from the region of reelin shown to associate with other reelin receptors such as VLDLR/ApoER2.;;Schmid RS, Jo R, Shelton S, Kreidberg JA, Anton ES. (2005) Reelin, integrin and DAB1 interactions during embryonic cerebral cortical development. Cereb Cortex 15(10):1632-6. PMID 15703255;

Reelin molecules have been shown;;Utsunomiya-Tate N, Kubo K, Tate S, Kainosho M, Katayama E, Nakajima K, Mikoshiba K. (2000) ''Reelin molecules assemble together to form a large protein complex, which is inhibited by the function-blocking CR-50 antibody.'' Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Aug 15;97(17):9729 PMID 10920200 [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=16933 free full text]; ;Kubo K, Mikoshiba K, Nakajima K. (2002) Neurosci Res. 43(4):381-8. ''Secreted Reelin molecules form homodimers.'' PMID 12135781;; to form a large protein complex, a disulfide-linked homodimer. If the homodimer fails to form, efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of DAB1 also fails.

Reelin-dependent strengthening of long-term potentiation is caused by ApoER2 interaction with NMDA receptor. This interaction happens when ApoER2 has a region coded by exon 19. ApoER2 gene is alternatively spliced, with the exon 19-containing variant more actively produced during periods of activity.;;Beffert U, Weeber EJ, Durudas A, Qiu S, Masiulis I, Sweatt JD, Li WP, Adelmann G, Frotscher M, Hammer RE, Herz J. ''Modulation of synaptic plasticity and memory by Reelin involves differential splicing of the lipoprotein receptor Apoer2.'' Neuron . 2005 Aug 18 ; 47(4):567-79. PMID 16102539 [http://jax.herzlab.org/Course2006/presentations/Beffert2005.pdf free full text PDF];;

Role in brain pathology
= Lissencephaly=
Disruptions of the RELN gene are condsidered to be the cause of the rare form of lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia called Norman-Roberts syndrome.;;Hong SE, Shugart YY, Huang DT, Shahwan SA, Grant PE, Hourihane JO, Martin ND, Walsh CA. (2000) Nat Genet. 26(1):93-6. ''Autosomal recessive lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia is associated with human RELN mutations.'' PMID 10973257;; Crino P. (2001) New RELN Mutation Associated with Lissencephaly and Epilepsy. Epilepsy Curr. 2001 Nov;1(2):72. PMID 15309195 ;; The mutations disrupt splicing of RELN cDNA, resulting in low or undetectable amounts of reelin protein. The phenotype in these patients was characterized by hypotonia, ataxia, and developmental delay, with lack of unsupported sitting and profound mental retardation with little or no language development. Seizures and congenital lymphedema were also present.

The Journal of Neuroscience, 22(14):5797-5802 PMID 12122039; ;Heinrich C, Nitta N, Flubacher A, Muller M, Fahrner A, Kirsch M, Freiman T, Suzuki F, Depaulis A, Frotscher M, Haas CA. (2006) Reelin deficiency and displacement of mature neurons, but not neurogenesis, underlie the formation of granule cell dispersion in the epileptic hippocampus. The Journal of Neuroscience, 26(17):4701-4713 PMID 16641251;; According to one study, prolonged seizures in a rat model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy have led to the loss of reelin-expressing interneurons and subsequent ectopic chain migration and aberrant integration of newborn dentate granule cells.Without reelin, the chain-migrating neuroblasts failed to detach properly.;;Gong C, Wang TW, Huang HS, Parent JM.

=Alzheimer's disease=
According to one study, reelin expression and glycosylation patterns are altered in Alzheimer's disease. In the cortex of the patients, reelin levels were 40% higher compared with controls, but the cerebellar levels of the protein remain normal in the same patients.;Botella-Lopez A, Burgaya F, Gavin R, Garcia-Ayllon MS, Gomez-Tortosa E, Pena-Casanova J, Urena JM, Del Rio JA, Blesa R, Soriano E, Saez-Valero J. (2006) Reelin expression and glycosylation patterns are altered in Alzheimer's disease. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 103(14):5573-8. PMID 16567613; This finding correlates with an earlier study showing the presence of Reelin associated with amyloid plaques in a transgenic AD mouse model. ;Wirths O, Multhaup G, Czech C, Blanchard V, Tremp G, Pradier L, Beyreuther K, Bayer TA. (2001) ''Reelin in plaques of beta-amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 double-transgenic mice.'' Neurosci Lett. 316(3):145-8. PMID 11744223;
