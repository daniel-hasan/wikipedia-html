James &quot;Jim&quot; Root (born October 2, 1971) is one of the current guitarists for Slipknot. He shares lead guitarist duties with fellow bandmate Mick Thomson. He is also the lead guitarist for Stone Sour.

History
Root joined Slipknot during the recording of their self-titled album after then-guitarist Josh Brainard decided to leave the band over his unhappiness with the band's direction. Singer Corey Taylor invited James to join the band because he knew him from their previous effort together, the first incarnation of Stone Sour. The only track on the self-titled album on which James can be heard is Purity, but this song was removed from the album due to a lawsuit and subsequent copies of the album do not feature any of James' playing. 

At 6'6&quot;, he is the tallest member of the band. He worked as a screen printer, waiter, and busboy before joining Slipknot. James has played in previous bands such as Deadfront, Anal Blast, and Atomic Opera. James is also the lead guitarist for Stone Sour, which he and Taylor reformed during the break between the Slipknot albums ''Iowa'' and ''Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)''. He released a Signature Fender Telecaster Guitar in July 2007. The guitar has a EMG 81 pickup at the bridge and a EMG 60 pickup at the neck.

James has been dating Lacuna Coil singer Cristina Scabbia since 2004. They met on the 2004 Ozzfest tour.

Masks
When Jim first joined Slipknot, he adopted ex-guitarist Josh Brainard's mask. It was a black bondage mask that covered most of his head. He had purple hair at the time and used to pull parts of it up through a hole in the top of the mask. After a couple of shows and one photo shoot, he decided to change masks, as the bondage mask was too uncomfortable to allow him to concentrate on playing. He adopted a jester's mask, said to represent that side of his personality. His most recent mask is a variation of this mask. It is still a jester's mask, but this one has red diamond detailing around the eyes and a zipper in between the lips
