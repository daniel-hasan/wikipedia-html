Ian McDiarmid (born August 11, 1944) is a Tony Award-winning Scottish actor and theatre director. He has had a successful career in theatre; he has been cast in many plays, while occasionally directing others. Although McDiarmid has appeared mostly in theatrical productions, he has also accepted roles in theatrical films and TV movies. Worldwide, he is most famous for his role as Palpatine in both the original and prequel ''Star Wars'' trilogies.

Biography
=Early life=
McDiarmid was born in Carnoustie. He became a theatre aficionado when he was five years old, when his father took him to see an act by the name of ''Tommy Morgan'' in a theatre located in Dundee. According to McDiarmid: 
;&quot;It sort of fascinated me, and it also scared me. All those lights, all that make-up. I said to myself, 'I don't know what this is, but I want it.';;;

However, fearing that his father wouldn't approve of his aspiration to be an actor, McDiarmid attended the University of St Andrews, where he received an M.A. in psychology. Soon after, he decided to pursue a career in the theatre instead, and took acting training courses at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. In 1968, McDiarmid received a gold medal for his work. This would later prove to be the first of many recognitions given to him for his work in the theatre. McDiarmid claimed he became its recipient &quot;by doing all the boring jobs you have to do when you are young, to eke out an existence.&quot;;[http://www.nerf-herders-anonymous.net/IanMcDiarmid.html/ Star Wars Actors Database at Nerf-Herders-Anonymous.net]; last accessed August 23 2006.;

=Theatrical work=
McDiarmid is renowned for his work in British theatre, having won plaudits as an actor and director from a wide variety of sources. He has starred in a variety of Shakespearean plays, including ''Hamlet'' (1972), ''The Tempest'' (1974, 2000), ''Much Ado About Nothing'' (1976), ''The Merchant of Venice'' (1984), and ''King Lear'' (2005). While at the Almedia, he directed plays such as ''Venice Preserv'd'' (1986) and ''Hippolytus'' (1991).; Ian McDiarmid's stage credits at [http://www.broadway.com/gen/Buzz_Star_File.aspx?ci=531308 Broadway.com]; last accessed November 27 2006.; 

In 2001, McDiarmid won Almedia Theatre's Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his role as Teddy in a revival of Brian Friel's ''Faith Healer''. Five years later in 2006, he reprised this role in his debut on Broadway.;; Directed by Kent, he performed alongside Ralph Fiennes and Cherry Jones, and won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play.; Ian McDiarmid at [http://www.hollywood.com/celebs/fulldetail/id/195431 Hollywood.com]; last accessed October 23 2006.; He has appeared most recently in the title role of John Gabriel Borkman running at the Donmar Theatre in London.

One theatrical performance of note is his portrayal of Harry Hackamore in Sam Shepard's play ''Seduced''. By McDiarmid's own description, Hackamore was a Howard Hughes-type character. To play the part, he was made-up in prosthetics, including a false beard and long fingernails, to resemble Hackamore. McDiarmid was only 37 at the time, and this convinced George Lucas and Richard Marquand that he could convincingly play a much older character in extreme cinematic close-up, which helped him land the role of Palpatine.;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001519/bio Ian McDiarmid at the Internet Movie Database]; last accessed August 26 2006.;

From 1990 until 2001, McDiarmid and Jonathan Kent served as the artistic directors of the Almeida Theatre, located in the Islington district of London. In 1998 they shared the Special Evening Standard Award for Theatrical Achievement of the Year.; Their tenure was marked by a string of highly successful performances involving 'big name' actors usually seen in films such as Kevin Spacey and Ralph Fiennes.;;

=BBC=
In 2005, McDiarmid portrayed the part of Satan in the 41 part BBC Four radio drama based on John Milton's ''Paradise Lost'', which was subsequently re-broadcast on BBC7.;;

=Work in Star Wars=

After a minor part in the film ''Dragonslayer'', McDiarmid was cast by George Lucas in ''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi'' as Emperor Palpatine, the principal villain. Sixteen years after appearing in ''Return of the Jedi'', he reprised the role as a younger Senator and Chancellor in the ''Star Wars'' prequel films. McDiarmid has the distinction of being the only ''Star Wars'' actor to reprise his role of a human character, an opportunity that he attributes to having been much younger than his character the first time he played the part. 

The prequels had him play two faces to his character; he re-created his diabolical interpretation of Palpatine from ''Return of the Jedi'' when playing Darth Sidious, the Chancellor's Sith alter ego, but created an attractive, pleasant, and seductive character in Palpatine's public persona. While he had previously achieved little recognition for this role, due to the extensive prosthetics used for the character which made him unrecognizable, he received widespread attention and critical acclaim for his expanded role in the prequels.; 

In the List of changes in Star Wars re-releases#2004 Star Wars trilogy|2004 re-release of ''Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back'', a brief scene between Darth Vader and a hologram of Emperor Palpatine was updated to have him depicted by McDiarmid (the Emperor was originally voiced by Clive Revill for that scene).;Palpatine, at the [http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/palpatine/?id=bts/ Star Wars Databank]; last accessed October 22, 2006.; With this addition to ''The Empire Strikes Back'', McDiarmid has now appeared in every film version in which Palpatine appears.
