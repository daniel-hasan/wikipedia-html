York City Football Club is an English football club based in York. The club participates in the Conference National, the fifth tier of English football. Founded in 1922, they joined the Football League in 1929, and have spent most of their history in the lower divisions. The club briefly rose as high as the second tier of English football, spending two seasons in the Second Division in the 1970s. At the end of the 2003-04 in English football|2003–04 season the club lost their League status when they were relegated from the Third Division, and have since remained in the Conference.

York have enjoyed more success in cup competitions than in the league, with highlights including an FA Cup semi-final appearance in 1955. In the 1995-96 in English football|1995–96 League Cup, York beat Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United 3–0 at Old Trafford;Manchester United went on to win the FA Cup and Premiership The Double#The English Double|double that season.

York play their home games at KitKat Crescent in York. This stadium was formerly known as Bootham Crescent, but was renamed KitKat Crescent as part of a sponsorship deal with Nestlé, whose confectionery factory, formerly known as Rowntree's, is one of the city's largest employers.

History

:''For information on the current season, see York City F.C. season 2007-08 or for previous years see York City F.C. seasons.''

York City Football Club was first founded in 1908 as an amateur side,;; although some sources state the roots of the club can be traced as far back as 1897 when the York and District League was formed.;; The club joined the Northern League in 1908, but left after two seasons to form the Yorkshire Combination (a proto-Yorkshire League). The club turned professional in 1912 and joined the Midland League, where they played for three seasons, rising as high as tenth position.They played their final season in 1914-15 in English football|1914–15 before folding in 1917 during the First World War.;{{cite web

York City squad of 1922.
The club was re-founded in 1922 by members of the former club. These members founded a limited company and gained admission to the Midland League where they played infor seven seasons, achieving a highest finish of sixth, in both 1924-25 in English football|1924–25 and 1926-27 in English football|1926–27.;;;; York were elected to the Football League in 1929,;; and spent the following 22 seasons in Division Three North, from 1929-30 in English football|1929–30 to 1957-58 in English football|1957–58. The club ended the majority of seasons in the bottom half of the table until the 1950s, when they reached fourth in both the 1952-53 in English football|1952–53 and 1954-55 in English football|1954–55 seasons.;

The club fared better in cup competitions and built a reputation for &quot;''giant killing''&quot;,;; the earliest example being in the 1937-38 in English football|1937–38 season FA Cup tournament, when the club, then playing in the Third Division, managed to knock out First Division West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion and Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough.They met Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town in the quarter-finals which was drawn 0–0, before losing the replay 2–1 at Leeds Road.; The club's longest cup run came when they reached the FA Cup semi-final in the 1954-55 in English football|1954–55 season, a campaign in which Arthur Bottom scored eight goals for the club, and the team eliminated a Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool side featuring Stanley Matthews.;; In the semi-final, York drew 1–1 with Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United, taking the tie to a replay, in which City were defeated 2–0.;

In 1958, York became founding members of the Fourth Division, as the Third Divisions North and South were restructured into new Third and Fourth divisions, based on league positions at the end of the 1957-58 in English football|1957–58 season. They missed out on the runner-up spot in the inaugural season only on goal average, and were promoted to the Third Division in third place,;; but were relegated back after just one season.;; A second promotion in 1964-65 in English football|1964–65, again in third place in the Fourth Division,;; saw a similar instant relegation back from the Third Division the next season.;; York's record of promotion every six years was maintained by a team sporting the future England forward Phil Boyer in 1970-71 in English football|1970–71,;;;; and this time the team managed to stay in the Third Division, albeit only on goal average in both the next two seasons.;;;;

After these two seasons the team hit form in the 1973-74 in English football|1973–74 season, when &quot;three up, three down&quot; promotion and relegation was introduced to the Football League. After being among the leaders all season York City were eventually promoted to Division Two in third place.Their first season in the Second Division saw York finish in their highest ever league position, 15th place.;On March 29, 1975, they played in front of the highest ever League crowd to see them &amp;ndash; 46,802 at Old Trafford in a 2–1 defeat to Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United. The following season York finished in 21st place in the Second Division and were relegated back to the Third Division.;Under former Manchester United manager Wilf McGuinness, the club dropped further still, into Division Four in the 1976-77 in English football|1976–77 season after finishing bottom of the Third Division. In the 1981-82 in English football|1981–82 season, York failed to win in 12 home games, a club record, and lost to non-league side Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham in the FA Cup. ;In the 1983-84 in English football|1983–84 season York won the Fourth Division with a record 101 points,; the first team to do so in the Football League.;; In January 1985, York City recorded a shock result in the Fourth Round of the FA Cup by beating Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal 1–0 at Bootham Crescent, courtesy of a penalty from Keith Houchen.;; York proceeded to draw 1–1 with Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool at Bootham Crescent on 16 February 1985, but lost 7–0 in the replay at Anfield, York's record cup defeat.;

In 1993 York ended a five year spell in the Third Division by gaining promotion to the Second Division via the playoffs, beating Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra on penalties in the final at Wembley Stadium.;; York stayed in the Second Division for six seasons, during which they reached the playoffs in their first season, but lost to Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County in the semi-finals.;

In December 2001, long-serving chairman Douglas Craig put the club and its ground up for sale for £4.5 million, announcing that unless a new owner was found before April 1, 2002, York City would be withdrawn from the Football League.;; Team B&amp;Q racing driver and team owner John Batchelor took over as chairman in March 2002.;; Batchelor promised the club he would buy the ground, give the trust 24% of the shares and would invite two supporters onto the board, but after these promises all went undelivered,;; a group of York supporters formed the ''Supporters’ Trust'' who took control of the club in 2003.;;

York failed to win any of their final 20 league fixtures in the 2003-04 in English football|2003–04 season and were relegated to the Conference after 75 years of League membership.; This was followed by the sacking of manager Chris Brass in November 2004.;; Billy McEwan eventually succeeded Brass,;; and led the team to 17th place during their first season in the Conference.;; York finished in 8th place in the 2005-06 in English football|2005–06 season,;; missing out on the playoffs. The following season, York reached the play-off semi-finals, where they were beaten by Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe.;;

Crest
York City crest: 1978–2002.York City originally had a crest which depicted the York Minster and a White Rose of York. This was replaced in the 1970s, when the club switched to a Y-shaped logo which featured on the front of the shirts.;;

In 1978 a new crest was introduced by York City, which depicted the York city walls#Bars|Bootham Bar, two red lions and the club name.; When John Batchelor took over as chairman of the club in 2002, the crest was replaced by one showing the club's new name of &quot;York City Soccer Club&quot;.;

After Batchelor's time in charge, the club name returned to &quot;Football Club&quot; and a new logo was introduced. The design for this logo was selected following a competition featured in York's Evening Press newspaper.This logo is still used by the club and shows five lions, four blue on a white background and one white on a red background.

Colours


Throughout the majority of the history of the club, York City have worn red shirts with white shorts. However, in the club's first season, 1922-23 in English football|1922–23, maroon shirts were worn, with white shorts and black socks. Moreover, in the 1930s, York changed their maroon jerseys to chocolate and cream stripes, a reference to the city's association with the confectionery industry. After five years they changed their colours to what were described as &quot;distinctive red shirts&quot;, with the official explanation that the striped jerseys clashed with opponents too often. To mark York's promotion to the Second Division in 1974, a bold white &quot;Y&quot; was added to the teams shirts, with the club coming to be referred to as the &quot;Y-fronts&quot;. In 1979, red shirts returned, along with navy shorts.;

In June 2003, York City agreed a deal for Nike, Inc.|Nike to provide the club's kits.;; Since 2004, the club has dropped navy from the kits and instead use plain red and white.; Though a sizeable proportion of the fans are unhappy with the navy being dropped.

Currently the club have also brought in a third kit in the form of a light blue shirt and socks, with maroon shorts. In pre-season friendlies it has been used in place of the usual away kit.;;

Stadia

KitKat Crescent in 2007.
Between 1921 and 1932, York City played their home games at Fulfordgate.;; York purchased the land for Bootham Crescent, a former cricket ground, in summer 1932, as it was closer to the club's centre of support and the railway station than Fulfordgate. Bootham Crescent was converted into a football ground; a main stand was built and a roof was erected above the Popular stand. The ground opened on 31 August 1932. In March 1938, the ground's record attendance was set when 28,123 people watched York City play Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town.;; 

Bootham Crescent was damaged during World War II when a bomb landed on the Shipton Street End, but shortly after the war ended, the terracing was laid properly with concrete. At this point most of the ground was still uncovered. The stadium was fitted with floodlights in 1959, which were used for the first time in a friendly against Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United on 28 October, 1959.;

During the mid-1980s, £300,000 was spent on a series of improvements to the Bootham Crescent ground, which was funded by money generated during York City's FA Cup run in the 1984-85 in English football|1984–85 season, which included games against Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal and then Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool, including a replay at Liverpool in front of a crowd of 43,000. The improvements included building hospitality suites behind the main stand, new club offices, turnstiles, new crush barriers, and the addition of more seats to the Popular Stand, giving a seating capacity of 2,883 seats out of a total capacity of 13,185.;

The capacity of Bootham Crescent had at one time been 12,475, with 3,245 seats, but this was reduced in 1994 because of an increase to the family area of the Main stand due to popular demand, and alterations to enable the ground to comply with the recommendations made in the Taylor Report. It saw 326 seats replacing a standing area, reducing capacity. Stricter rules concerning the density of people standing resulting from the Taylor Report further reduced capacity.;

New floodlights were installed during the summer of 1995, costing £122,000. These floodlights are twice as bright as the original floodlights, and meet the requirements for Division One football. A drainage system was installed to improve the quality of the pitch during winter, costing several thousand pounds. A water tower was also installed in the late 1990s.;

York had planned a move to Huntington Stadium in 2003, but withdrew their application as they were given a loan of £2 million from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund, which secured the purchase of Bootham Crescent.;;In January 2005, following a sponsorship deal with Nestlé, Bootham Crescent was renamed KitKat Crescent.;; The ground currently holds a capacity of 9,034.;

=New stadium=
On 4 February 2004, the club's board announced that an agreement had been reached which would see York City remain at Bootham Crescent until 2015.; York's board revealed in February 2007 that the club are hoping the move to a new ground can be completed within five years.;; It is hoped that the new stadium will not just provide a home for York City, but can also be used as a concert venue.;; It is to be built on either the British Sugar factory site, York Central or land north of the Nestlé complex.;;

The new stadium will be similar to Princes Park of Dartford F.C.|Dartford FC, but will hold a larger capacity. Steve Galloway, City of York Council leader, said his aspiration was for a 10,000-seater stadium to be built, which would be home to both York City and York City Knights, although, speaking at the launch of his party's election manifesto on 3 April, 2007, he said it may be smaller initially, at 6,000 or 7,000 seats.;

Supporters and rivalries
York City is one of the best supported clubs in the Conference National, with an average home attendance of 3,054 for the 2006-07 in English football|2006–07 season.;; The club has a number of domestic supporters' groups, including Harrogate Minstermen and the Jorvik Reds.;; The York Nomad Society is the hooligan firm associated with the club.;; Like some other professional football clubs in England, York City has a small number of fans who have had Banning Orders placed on them by the club for unreasonable behaviour.;;;;

For home games, the club produces an &quot;Official Match programme&quot;, which consists of 48 pages and is sold for £2.50. The club is also the subject of an independent supporters' fanzine, ''Ginner's Left Foot'', which was launched in February 2002.;; Dr. John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York, became the patron to York City for the 2007-08 in English football|2007–08 season, after purchasing a season ticket in May 2007.;;

Traditionally, York City's two main rivalries have been with Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough and Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City.;; The rivalry between Hull and York is represented by a battle between lion (York City's mascot) and tiger (Hull City's mascot), but in recent times the clubs have played in different league and so it has not been as intense. To a lesser extent there are also local rivalries with Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers, Darlington F.C.|Darlington, Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United and more recently one with Greater Manchester side Bury F.C.|Bury.;

Statistics and records

Barry Jackson holds the record for York City appearances, having played 539 matches. Former defender Andy McMillan comes second, having played 492 matches. The record for a goalkeeper is held by Tommy Forgan, with 428 appearances.;; Norman Wilkinson is the club's top goalscorer with 143 goals in all competitions. Wilkinson also holds the club record for goals scored in the League (127) and FA Cup (16).;;

The club's widest victory margin in the league was their 9&amp;ndash;1 win against Southport F.C.|Southport in the Division Three North in 1957. Their heaviest defeat in the league was 12&amp;ndash;0 against Chester City F.C.|Chester City in 1936.;;

York City's record home attendance is 28,123, for an FA Cup match against Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town on 5 March 1938 at Bootham Crescent.; With the introduction of regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, it is unlikely that this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future.

The highest transfer fee received for a York City player is £1&amp;nbsp;million, from Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United for Jonathan Greening in March 1998, while the most spent by the club on a player was £140,000 for Adrian Randall from Burnley F.C.|Burnley in December 1995.;
