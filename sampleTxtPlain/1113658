''Chicago 19'' is the nineteenth album by American rock band Chicago and was released in 1988.After recording ''Chicago 18'' with David Foster, the band decided to expand their sound with other producers and worked primarily with Ron Nevison and Chas Sandford for this album.There was also a slight shifting in labels, with their Full Moon Records imprint now being carried by Reprise Records.

Similar to the reaction to its predecessor, ''Chicago 19'' became a moderate success on the album chart (although it went platinum) yet had major hit singles, including the #1 hit &quot;Look Away&quot;, as well as &quot;I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love&quot; (#3), and &quot;You're Not Alone&quot; (#10).A slightly remixed version of Jason Scheff's &quot;What Kind Of Man Would I Be?&quot; (#5) would also prove to be a big success in late 1989, as part of the follow-up ''Greatest Hits 1982-1989'' release. This album was the first Chicago effort to spotlight keyboardist/singer Bill Champlin, who sung all three of the album's hit singles.The fact that the group was highlighting a different voice on singles that had no signature horn sound may have hindered 19's sales.

However, following its release, there would be another line-up casualty with the surprising 1990 firing of founding drummer Danny Seraphine, making ''Chicago 19'' his last project with Chicago, just over twenty years after they originally formed.He would be replaced on the next studio album by ace session drummer Tris Imboden, who remains to this day.
