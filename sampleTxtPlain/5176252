''Diary of a Camper'' is a short 1996 American film created by United Ranger Films, then a subdivision of a popular group of players, or clan, known as the Rangers. Made using id Software's 1996 first-person shooter computer game ''Quake'' and released over the Internet as a non-interactive game demo file, the video is considered;Marino 2004, 6; Lowood 2006, 32; Kelland, Morris, &amp; Lloyd, 28.; the first example of machinima—the art of using real-time, virtual 3-D environments, often game engines, to create animated films. The story centers on a lone camper, a pejorative for a player who waits in a strategic location instead of seeking active battle, who faces five members of the Rangers clan in a deathmatch, a type of multiplayer game whose goal is to kill as many opponents as possible.

Although players had previously recorded segments of gameplay, these were usually deathmatches or speedruns, attempts to complete a map as quickly as possible. ''Diary of a Camper'' was the first demo to contain a narrative with (text-based) dialogue, instead of merely showing gameplay. Commentators agree that the work itself is primitive, but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking.

Synopsis
The film occurs entirely within the ''Quake'' map DM6 (&quot;The Dark Zone&quot;). After exploring some of the area, the Rangers gather and decide to send two members, Sphinx and Pyoveli, to scout a room above. Shortly after they teleport into the room, the camper waiting there kills them both, as confirmed by in-game text messages that appear on the screen. The remaining three Rangers—ColdSun, ArchV, and an unidentified member—realize their comrades' fate and return fire from a distance, killing the camper. Examining the remains, they identify their foe as John Romero.;Brown.;

Precedent and new ground
''Diary of a Camper'' built on the ability to record gameplay, which first appeared in id Software's 1993 computer game ''Doom''. Using this feature, players could efficiently record game events, rather than the rendered video itself, and later replay them in real-time through the game engine.;Marino 2004, 3.; ''Doom''s successor, ''Quake'', offered new opportunities for both gameplay and customization,;Lowood 2005, 12.; while preserving the demo recording ability.;Marino 2004, 4.; In the book ''Machinima'', Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd stated that multiplayer games became popular, almost a sport, and demo files of matches were recorded and studied.;Kelland, Morris, &amp; Lloyd, 28.; Paul Marino, executive director of the Academy of Machinima Arts &amp; Sciences (AMAS), used a different analogy: &quot;Players began to record deathmatches with a more cinematic flare.… ''[T]he viewpoint of the player became the viewpoint of a director.''&quot;;Marino 2004, 4, emphasis in original.;

When the Rangers released ''Diary of a Camper'' on October 26, 1996,;Marino 2004, 21.; they were already well-known for their playing skill and their ability to program game modifications. The group's new demo surprised the ''Quake'' community by exploiting the game differently. It contained the action and gore of previous gameplay demos, but in the context of a simple story;Lowood 2006, 32.; instead of the usual deathmatch.; Like many of its predecessors, the demo was recorded in ''Quake''s networked multiplayer deathmatch mode, but &quot;it marked the transition from sports footage to moviemaking. The players were choreographed like actors, … delivering their lines as plain text….&quot;; Henry Lowood of Stanford University stated that &quot;''Diary of a Camper'' breaks with the demo movie as documented gameplay&quot; because the spectator's perspective is independent &quot;from that of any player/actor; the movie is not 'shot' from the first-person perspective of the shooter.&quot;;Lowood 2006, 33.; Lowood called the film a &quot;transformation of competitive play to … minimal theatrical play&quot;, emphasized through the inclusion of references to gameplay, such as the camper.;Lowood 2005, 13.;

Before ''Diary of a Camper''s release, Uwe Girlich, a German doctoral candidate,;Kelland, Morris, &amp; Lloyd, 37.; had documented the ''Quake'' demo file format, in which &quot;the player coordinates and camera positions may be different&quot;.; He added that &quot;for people with too much spare-time ''Quake'' can replace a full 3D modelling system&quot;.; However, the Rangers developed ''Diary of a Camper'' before any demo-editing software tools had been publicly released; clan member Eric &quot;ArchV&quot; Fowler instead created his own tools to reposition the camera and to splice recorded footage.;Lowood 2006, 33; Who's Who in Quake.; As with all of United Ranger Films' productions, Heath &quot;ColdSun&quot; Brown wrote the story, and Matt &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; Van Sickler was the director.;Who's Who in Quake; In the release notes, Brown credits clan members Chris &quot;Sphinx&quot; Birke;Real name established in Salen.; and Mute with helping Fowler with &quot;movie packaging&quot;.;

''Diary of a Camper'' and the films that it inspired were initially called &quot;''Quake'' movies&quot;; the term ''machinima'' was not coined until 1998,;Marino 2004, 1.; in response to the increasing use of other game engines.;Marino 2004, 12.; Therefore, there was initial hesitance to retroactively label ''Diary of a Camper'' the first machinima piece; a Machinima.com article from January 2000 opened, &quot;It's kinda hard to pin down the first Machinima: things like the Doom speedruns, the Stunt Island stuff and the Demo Scene all compete for the title. However, it's a lot easier to pin down the first piece of film made in a 3D game engine: Diary Of A Camper&quot;.;Ranger Gone AWOL.; However, after the AMAS later defined machinima as &quot;animated filmmaking within a real-time virtual 3-D environment&quot;,; commentators, such as Marino;Marino 2004, 6.; and Lowood,;Lowood 2006, 32.; unambiguously called the film the first machinima work.

Reception
Despite ''Diary of a Camper'';';s importance in establishing machinima, commentators have criticized the film's actual content. Marino called the plot &quot;simple&quot;;; likewise, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd believed that &quot;it wasn't much of a story&quot;,; and Lowood wrote that &quot;the plot offers little more than a brief sequence of inside jokes&quot;.; Roger Matthews of the ''Quake'' Movie Library called the film &quot;not much more than a deathmatch with a camera&quot;.;Matthews.; On Psyk's Popcorn Jungle, Paul Coates bluntly wrote, &quot;This movie is ''dull''. It is ''not very interesting''.&quot;;Coates, emphasis in original.; Stephen Lum of The Cineplex said that the film contained &quot;weird humour&quot;.;Lum.;

Although ''Quake'' movie critics found shortcomings in ''Diary of a Camper'', they mentioned positive aspects, including the work's novelty; however, their final ratings varied. Matthews wrote that &quot;the camera work was very nice and never once screwed up&quot;,; and Lum gave the film &quot;a perfect 10 for Innovation/Originality because [it] started the Quake Movie craze&quot;.; Of the major ''Quake'' movie review sites,;As listed in Marino 2004, 7.; only The Cineplex gave ''Diary'' a good rating overall, 7.5 out of 10.; Matthews and Coates rated the film 20% out of 100%; and 2 out of 10,;Coates.; respectively. Later, Coates updated his review, saying, &quot;I feel I overreacted at the fact that DoaC was old. It's the first ''ever'' Quake movie. I have to give the Rangers massive credit for that.… But, by today's standards, the rating seems to fit.&quot;;

Because of its significance, ''Diary of a Camper'' continues to be featured in machinima presentations. In a 2005 event at Stanford University, the film was presented with later machinima works, such as ''Red vs. Blue''.;Lue.; Likewise, the Australian Centre for the Moving Image included it in a machinima exhibit that ended on July 16, 2006.;Marino, Machinima jukebox; Playing the Movies.;
