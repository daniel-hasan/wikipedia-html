Cydonia Mensae is an albedo feature (region) on Mars. It lies in the planet's northern hemisphere in a transitional zone between the heavily cratered regions to the South, and relatively smooth plains to the North.Some planetologists believe that the northern plains may once have been ocean beds;Head, J.W., Kreslavsky, M., Hiesinger, H., Ivanov, M., Pratt, S., Seibert, N., Smith, D.E. and Zuber, M.T.

The Face on Mars

One of the Cydonian mesas, situated at 40°75' north latitude and 9°46' west longitude, took on the striking appearance of a humanoid Face on Mars in a photo taken by Viking 1 on July 25, 1976.This discovery was made independently by two computer engineers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Vincent DiPietro and Gregory Molenaar. While searching through NASA archives they discovered two misfiled images, Viking frames 35A72 and 70A13.When the images were originally acquired in 1976, Viking chief scientist Gerry Soffen dismissed the &quot;face&quot; in image 35A72 as &quot;a trick of light and shadow&quot; which &quot;disappeared several hours later&quot;.However, the second &quot;face&quot; image, 70A13, was acquired 35 Viking orbits later and at a different &quot;sun-angle&quot; to the 35A72 image.Subsequently, DiPietro and Molenaar developed an image processing technique (Starburst Pixel Interleaving Technique) to Super-resolution|increase the resolution of the original images (the technique was validated using Landsat images).

Some commentators, most notably Richard C. Hoagland, believe it to be evidence of a long-lost Martian civilization along with other features they believe are present, such as apparent pyramids, which they argue are part of a ruined city. Image analysis of the early Viking images led a few researchers to suggest that the features of the Face might not be an accidental consequence of viewing conditions;. 

However, today it is generally accepted to be an optical illusion, an example of pareidolia;Britt, R.R., [http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/03/17/alien.debunk/index.html Scientist attacks alien claims on Mars], CNN, 18 March 2004.Retrieved 12 October 2007.;. After analysis of the higher resolution Mars Global Surveyor data NASA stated that &quot;a detailed analysis of multiple images of this feature reveals a natural looking Martian hill whose illusory face-like appearance depends on the viewing angle and angle of illumination&quot;;;.Similar optical illusions can be found in the geology of Earth; an example is the Badlands Guardian, which resembles a human head wearing a Native American headress;;.

Originally, eighteen images of the Cydonia Mensae region were taken by the Viking 1 and Viking 2 orbiters, but only seven have resolutions better than 250 m/pixel (820 ft/pixel). The other eleven images have resolutions worse than 550 m/pixel (1800 ft/pixel) and are virtually useless for studying the feature. Of the seven good images, the lighting and time at which two pairs of images were taken are so close as to reduce the number to five usable, distinct images. The ''Mission to Mars: Viking Orbiter Images of Mars'' CD-ROM image numbers are: 35A72 (VO-1010), 70A13 (VO-1011), 561A25 (VO-1021), 673B56 &amp; 673B54 (VO-1063), and 753A33 &amp; 753A34 (VO-1028);[http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/Admin/resources/cd_viking.html ''Mission to Mars: Viking Orbiter Images of Mars'' website], NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory; raw data in Alphabetical_list_of_file_extensions#I|IMQ (ImageQ) format can be downloaded from these links: [http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/geo/vo1_vo2-m-vis-2-edr-v2/vo_1010/f035axx/f035a72.imq 35A72], [http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/geo/vo1_vo2-m-vis-2-edr-v2/vo_1011/f070axx/f070a13.imq 70A13], [http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/geo/vo1_vo2-m-vis-2-edr-v2/vo_1021/f561axx/f561a25.imq 561A25], [http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/geo/vo1_vo2-m-vis-2-edr-v2/vo_1063/f673bxx/f673b56.imq 673B56],

Since September 2006, a succession of new data from the Cydonia region have been published by the European Space Agency and the HiRISE team.These have included photographs taken by the Mars Express probe;; and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter,;; and a 3D animation of the &quot;Face on Mars&quot; using a combination of digital data from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on the Mars Express probe and the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) on board NASA's Mars Global Surveyor.;;In contrast to the relatively low resolution of the Viking images of Cydonia, these new platforms afford much improved resolution.For instance, the Mars Express images are at a resolution of 14 m/pixel (46 ft/pixel) or better.

Cydonia and the Face on Mars appear frequently in popular culture, including feature films, television series, videogames, comic books, and even music.;For example: Film - ''Mission to Mars'' (2000); TV series - ''The X-Files'' (&quot;Space (The X-Files)|Space&quot;, 1993), ''Futurama'' (&quot;Where The Buggalo Roam&quot;, 2002); Videogames - ''Zak McKracken'' (1988), ''X-COM: UFO Defense'' (1993); Comic books - ''Martian Manhunter'' #1 (1998); Music - ''Telemetry of a Fallen Angel'' by Cruxshadows (1995), &quot;Knights of Cydonia&quot; by Muse (2006).;

Astronomer Carl Sagan criticized many conclusions people have made about it in his book ''The Demon Haunted World''.
