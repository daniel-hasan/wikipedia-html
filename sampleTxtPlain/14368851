James 'Jim' Hermiston (born 30 September 1947 in Edinburgh) is a former professional footballer and police officer.He played for Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen in Scotland and a number of clubs in Australia - he most notably won the 1970 Scottish Cup with Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen, and was inducted into the Aberdeen F.C.#AFC Hall of Fame|Aberdeen FC &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; as one of the founding members in 2003.He also served with the police forces in the north of Scotland and Queensland.

Football career

Hermiston began his career as a teenager with Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic F.C.|Bonnyrigg Rose, and was signed for Aberdeen by Eddie Turnbull in 1965.He made his debut for Aberdeen the following year, and went on to play 270 times for the club in all competitions.He was a member of the Scottish Cup 1969-70|1969-70 Scottish Cup winning team, and was captain of the side toward the end of his time there;.

Hermiston was overlooked for the Scotland squad for the 1974 World Cup, and this led him to seek a move to England.However, a proposed transfer to Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea failed to materialise, and Hermiston decided to retire from the game at the age of 27 to join Grampian Police as a Police Constable.It is possible that as a PC, his duties may have included policing matches at Aberdeen's ground, Pittodrie Stadium, but it is not clear whether he ever actually did so.;;

Hermiston and his family emigrated to Australia shortly afterwards, and he resumed his football career there, playing for Grange Thistle, then Brisbane City and Brisbane Lions before returning to police work after a brief spell as manager of Brisbane City;[http://www.ozfootball.net/museum/coachmgr.html &quot;Soccer's sacrificial lambs... the coaches&quot;, Australian Online Soccer Museum];.

Hermiston was a popular player in Australia, to the extent of having a children's coaching manual published under his name; ;.He was twice in Philips Cup winning teams, and was even considered as a potential captain of the Australian team ;.However, this did not come to pass thanks to Hermiston having played part of a game for the Scottish Under-23 side in the early 1970s - the international rules at the time forbidding a player who had represented one country at any level from representing another.He also played one game for the Scottish League representative side, a 5-0 defeat by the English League team at Maine Road, Manchester on March 20th, 1974.;[http://www.londonhearts.com/sfl/players/jimhermiston.html Jim Hermiston - Scotland Football League record];.
