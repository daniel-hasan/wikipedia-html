State Highway 7, often abbreviated as OK-7 or SH-7, is a 150-mile;; (242 km) highway in southern Oklahoma. This lengthy highway connects many towns in Oklahoma's &quot;Little Dixie&quot; area. It runs from Interstate 44 in Lawton to U.S. U.S. Route 69|69/U.S. Route 75|U.S. 75 in Atoka.

Route description
OK-7 shield in Sulphur.
From its western terminus at the interchange with Interstate 44 and Lee Boulevard in Lawton, OK-7 is a multilane highway. It runs due east from Lawton for ten miles before intersecting State Highway 65 in the unincorporated community of Pumpkin Center. It continues due east for 14 more miles on a straight stretch of highway only very slight curves, bypassing the town of Central High, before meeting U.S. Route 81|U.S. 81 north of Duncan. 

OK-7 and U.S. 81 overlap for 6 miles through Duncan, after which the state highway splits off to the east once again, still as a multilane highway, though it falls to a two-lane road after a few miles. Next the highway passes through the town of Velma before meeting State Highway 76 in Ratliff City. The southern section of OK-74, which roughly mirrors SH-76's path, has its southern terminus at OK-7 seven miles later, near Tatums. 

After crossing Interstate 35, OK-7 becomes a multilane highway once again. Three miles later, it meets U.S. Route 77|U.S. 77 near Davis. On the other side of Davis, OK-7 is the northern terminus of OK-110, a connector route to the town of Dougherty. Two miles west of Sulphur, the highway connects to the southern terminus of the Chickasaw Turnpike, a toll highway to Ada. After passing through Sulphur (where it has a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 177|U.S. 177), OK-7 travels six more miles, where it meets Highway 1.

For ten miles, OK-7 and OK-1 overlap, through the town of Mill Creek. This concurrency ends three miles south of Mill Creek, where it serves the unincorporated community of Reagan and the Slippery Falls Boy Scout Ranch. It shares a one-mile three-route concurrency with U.S. Route 377|U.S. 377/OK-99. Thirteen miles east of the concurrency, it serves the town of Wapanucka, Oklahoma, where it intersects OK-48. Seventeen miles later, it ends at U.S. 75 in Atoka.

History
OK-7 is a former border to border east-west state highway across southern Oklahoma whose western terminus was at the Texas border west of Hollis and eastern terminus at the Arkansas border east of Broken Bow.; OK-7's route was truncated on its eastern and western sections during the 1960s and 1970s as those were concurrent with U.S. Route 62|U.S. 62 between the Texas border and Lawton and with U.S. Route 70|U.S. 70 between Broken Bow and the Arkansas border.;; The eastern portion of OK-7 that was concurrent with U.S. 70 between Broken Bow and the Arkansas border was truncated in 1963 to its junction with U.S. 70 in Broken Bow.;; The western section of OK-7 concurrent with U.S. 62 from Lawton to the Texas border was truncated in 1970;;, when the highway's western terminus was pushed back to the to the intersection of Cache Road (U.S. 62) and Sheridan Road in Lawton, and a few miles further back in 2003 to its current terminus at Interstate 44 in east Lawton.;; 

Along still-intact sections of OK-7, major route changes through the years include a relocation in Duncan during the early 1950s, when the original route along Main Street through the downtown area was moved south of the business district along Bois D'Arc Avenue from U.S. 81 eastward to tie in with the original Main Street route on Duncan's east side, which became OK-7 Alternate and now designated as OK-7 Business. In 1969, the main Bois D'Arc Avenue alignment in Duncan was relocated slightly to the south and the rerouting continued for some 20 miles from the OK-7/OK-7 Business junction to Velma on a new and straighter alignment (including both multi-lane divided highway and two-lane roadway) that bypassed the old OK-7 alignment through the oil fields of eastern Stephens County along with the town of Velma.;; In the 1980s, the new OK-7 was extended east of Velma past the small community of County Line on the Stephens/Carter county line to west of Ratliff City in Carter County.;;;;

By 1985, the eastern terminus of OK-7 was pushed back to its intersection with OK-3 and U.S. 69/75 in Atoka when OK-7 was again truncated and lost its concurrency with OK-3 from Atoka to Broken Bow.;

Spurs
SH-7 has two spur routes: 

* OK-7B, also signed as Business OK-7, is the original alignment of OK-7 through Duncan. 
* OK-7D is a 3.5 mile spur to the town of Bromide.
