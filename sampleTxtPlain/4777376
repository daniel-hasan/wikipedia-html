Bad Street Brawler is a 1987 video game by Beam Software Pty., Ltd.. It was distributed worldwide by Mindscape Inc. and Mattel. The original ''Bad Street Brawler'' is one of the earliest Beat 'em up or scrolling fighting games.

The player plays the character, Duke Davis, who goes from stage to stage beating up gangsters that get in his way, dressed in a yellow tank top, sunglasses, and yellow pants. He is described as a former punk rocker and the &quot;world's coolest&quot; martial artist.

Before the start of the next stage, quotes are introduced to entertain the player (i.e., ''Never trouble trouble until trouble troubles you''). The player fights a variety of enemies, such as gorillas and old ladies who throw pocketbooks at the player (resembling weightlifter dwarves who throw dumbbells at the player). 


Power Glove
The game was one of only two NES games specifically designed for use with the Nintendo Power Glove.
