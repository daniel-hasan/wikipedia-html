Jackson has noted that he chooses roles that are &quot;exciting to watch&quot; and have an &quot;interesting character inside of a story&quot;, and that in his roles he wanted to &quot;do things [he hasn't] done, things he saw as a kid and wanted to do and now has an opportunity to do&quot;.;; 

Biography
=Early life=
Jackson was born in Washington, D.C. He grew up as an only child in Chattanooga, Tennessee with his mother, Elizabeth Jackson (née Montgomery), who was a factory worker and later a supplies buyer for a mental institution, and his maternal grandparents and extended family.;Stated in interview on ''Inside the Actors Studio'', 2002;;; His father lived away from the family in Kansas City, Missouri and later died from alcoholism; Jackson had only met his father twice during his life.;;; Jackson attended Riverside High (Now Chattanooga School for the Arts and Sciences), a segregated school where, between the third and twelfth grades, he played the French horn and trumpet in the school orchestra.; He later attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, where he co-founded the &quot;Just Us Theater&quot;.; He graduated in 1972.;;

=Civil Rights Movement involvement=
After the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Jackson attended the funeral in Atlanta as one of the ushers.;; Jackson then flew to Memphis to join an equal rights protest march. In a recent ''Parade'' interview Jackson revealed: &quot;I was angry about the assassination, but I wasn’t shocked by it. I knew that change was going to take something different—not sit-ins, not peaceful coexistence.&quot;;; In 1969, Jackson and several other students held members of the Morehouse College board of trustees (including a nearby Martin Luther King, Sr.) hostage on the campus, demanding reform in the school’s curriculum and governance.;; The college eventually agreed to change its ways, but Jackson was suspended for two years for his actions (although he would later return to the college to earn his Bachelor of Arts in Drama in 1972).;; Jackson decided to remain in Atlanta, where he met with Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown and others active in the Black Power movement.; Jackson revealed in the same ''Parade'' interview that he began to feel empowered with his involvement in the movement, especially when the group began buying guns.; However, before Jackson could become involved with any significant armed struggle, his mother sent him to Los Angeles after the F.B.I. told her that he would die within a year if he remained with the Black Power movement.;

Acting career
=1970s - 1980s=
Jackson initially decided to go to Morehouse College to major in Architecture, but decided to change his major to Drama;; after taking a public speaking class and appearing in a version of ''The Threepenny Opera''.;; Jackson began acting in multiple plays including ''Home'' and ''A Soldier's Play''.; He also landed himself in several TV films, and his first feature film was in ''Together for Days'' (1972). After these initial roles, Jackson proceeded to move from Atlanta to New York City in 1976 and spent the next decade appearing in stage plays such as ''The Piano Lesson'' and ''Two Trains Running'' which both premiered at the Yale Repertory Theater .;; At this point in his early career, Jackson developed an alcohol and cocaine addiction, resulting in him being unable to proceed with the two plays as they continued to Broadway (actors Charles S. Dutton and Anthony Chisolm took his place).; Throughout his early film career, mainly in minimal roles in films such as ''Coming to America'' (as a criminal knocking over a fast food joint) and various TV films, Jackson was mentored by Morgan Freeman.; After a 1981 performance in the play ''A Soldier's Play'', Jackson was introduced to beginning director Spike Lee; who would later include him in small roles for the films ''School Daze'' (1988) and ''Do the Right Thing'' (1989).; He also played a minor role in the 1990 Martin Scorsese film ''Goodfellas'' as real-life Mafia associate Stacks Edwards.

=1990s=
Jackson as Jules Winnfield in ''Pulp Fiction'', 1994
After completing these films, Jackson's cocaine addiction continued to increase to the point wherehe overdosed, and his family entered him into a New York rehab clinic.; When he successfully completed rehab, Jackson acted in ''Jungle Fever'', as the cocaine addict brother to the relatively new actor Wesley Snipes, a role which Jackson called cathartic as he was recovering from his addiction.; The film was so acclaimed that the 1991 Cannes Film Festival awarded a special &quot;Supporting Actor&quot; award just for him.;;; After this role, Jackson became involved with multiple film requests, including ''Strictly Business'', ''Juice'', ''Patriot Games'', and then moving on to two comedies: ''National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1'' and ''Amos &amp; Andrew''. After rapid involvement in these films, Jackson worked with director Steven Spielberg in ''Jurassic Park''. He played a major role in Quentin Tarantino's ''Pulp Fiction''. The film was perhaps Jackson's most notable role, mainly for his monologues and one-liners along with co-star John Travolta.; The film earned Jackson an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and a BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award win.;;

With a succession of unsuccessful films such as ''Kiss of Death'', ''The Great White Hype'', and ''Losing Isaiah'', Jackson began to receive poor reviews from critics who were just praising him before with ''Pulp Fiction''. This ended with his involvement in the two successful box office films ''A Time To Kill'', where he depicted a father who is put on trial for killing two men who raped his daughter, and ''Die Hard with a Vengeance'', co-starring along side Bruce Willis in the third installment of the ''Die Hard'' series. For ''A Time to Kill'', Jackson earned a NAACP Image for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture.;;

Quickly becoming a box office star, Jackson continued with three starring roles in 1997. In ''187'' he played a teacher, dedicated to educating students in a Los Angeles high school but with a terrible secret. He received an Independent Spirit award for Best First Feature; alongside first-time writer/director Kasi Lemmons in the drama film ''Eve's Bayou'', for which he also served as executive producer. He joined up again with director Quentin Tarantino and received a Berlin Film Festival Silver Bear for Best Actor for his portrayal as an arms merchant in ''Jackie Brown''.; In 1998, he worked with other established actors such as Sharon Stone and Dustin Hoffman in ''Sphere'' and Kevin Spacey in ''The Negotiator'', playing a hostage negotiator who resorts to taking hostages himself when he is falsely accused of murder and embezzlement. In 1999, Jackson starred in a shark horror film, ''Deep Blue Sea'', and as Jedi Master Mace Windu in George Lucas's ''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace''. In an interview, Jackson claimed that he did not have a chance to read the script for the film and did not learn he was playing the character Mace Windu until he was fitted for his costume (it is said that he was eager to accept any role, just for the chance to be a part of the Star Wars saga).;;

In 2003, Jackson portrayed another character in a military role, working with John Travolta again in ''Basic'' and then as a police sergeant alongside Colin Farrell in the television show remake ''S.W.A.T.
