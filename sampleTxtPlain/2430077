Jeff Drouin-Deslauriers (born 15 May, 1984) is a professional ice hockey goaltender.He was selected in the second round of the 2002 NHL Entry Draft, 31st overall, by the Edmonton Oilers.

Deslauriers was selected from Chicoutimi of the QMJHL, where he was the starting goaltender for three seasons.He was twice the runner up for the backup job on Canada's World Junior Championship team.

The 2004-05 season was Deslauriers' first professional experience.He split time between the Edmonton Road Runners of the AHL and the Greenville Grrrowl of the ECHL.It was not a good season for Deslauriers, as he fought injury problems, and played for an AHL team that failed to make the playoffs.

In the 2005-06 season, due to the Oilers not having a farm team, Deslauriers only played 13 games and struggled, before being sent down once again to the Grrrowl.

The 2006-07 season was a turnaround, however. Deslauriers was back in the AHL with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and eventually became the team's starting goaltender. He played well, and ranked among the top goaltenders in the league.
