''The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest'' is an animated action-adventure television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Cartoons and broadcast on Cartoon Network from August 26, 1996 to April 16, 1997. A revival of the ''Jonny Quest'' franchise, it featured Jonny and Hadji as teenage protagonists with a new character named Jessie.;; Creators staged the show around Dr. Quest's investigations of &quot;existing, real phenomena&quot; and mysteries in exotic locales, which brought him into conflict with ethically-differing villains.;;;; Action also took place in the virtual reality of QuestWorld, a 3D cyberspace domain rendered with computer animation.;; There are currently no plans for re-broadcasting or release on DVD.

Conceived in the early 1990s, ''Real Adventures'' suffered a long and troubled development.; Hanna-Barbera dismissed the original creative team in 1996 and hired new producers to finish the show.; One team finished the previous team's premiere work, while the other wrote new episodes with reworked character designs akin to classic ''Quest''.;; Each team produced twenty-six episodes for fifty-two overall.;; The first team crafted stories of real-world mystery and exploration, while later writers invoked more liberal science fiction and paranormal plots.;

Hanna-Barbera supported the show through a massive marketing campaign with thirty-three licensees.; ''Real Adventures'' debuted with an unprecedentedly wide release on Cartoon Network, TBS Superstation, and TNT, airing twenty-one times a week.;;;; Critics debated the merits of the animation, writing, and show's spirit compared to classic ''Quest''.;;;; ''Real Adventures'' failed to gain consistent ratings and its merchandise performed poorly, leading to cancellation after fifty-two episodes.; Eight episodes were released in 1996 on VHS, and reruns appeared until September 24, 1999 on Toonami, on other formats on Cartoon Network until December 14, 2002, and on CNX until 2003.;;;;;

Development and history
Hanna-Barbera created ''The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest'' in the early 1990s as part of Turner Entertainment's plan to revive old brands.;;; Hanna-Barbera's chief Fred Seibert claimed in 1994 that the company received more ''Quest'' fan mail than any other franchise.;;; The company planned a new series, live action film, and two telefilms—''Jonny's Golden Quest'' and ''Jonny Quest vs. The Cyber Insects''.;;; Combined with a substantial marketing campaign, the push would be their &quot;largest corporate initiative...undertaken since Turner acquired Hanna-Barbera.&quot;;; Led by director Dick Sebast, the first ''Real Adventures'' development team was briefly dismissed in favor of writer Peter Lawrence and art director Takashi.; He designed the characters and Jonny to be &quot;edgier...more handsome, rather than the cute kid he used to be,&quot; rendered in the style of Japanese animation as an &quot;antidote to a market dominated by spandex superheroes.&quot;;;; The team used a new character—Race's daughter, Jessie Bannon—to create conflict with Jonny.; She previously appeared in the 1986 ''Jonny Quest'' episodes as a general's daughter, and would debut in the telefilms as Race's daughter by Jezebel Jade.; Intended for a 1995 release with sixty-five episodes, the project fell into development hell, remaining there until early 1996.;; Hanna-Barbera axed Lawrence and Takashi, hiring John Eng and Cos Anzilotti to finish the first twenty-six episodes.;;;;; Turner pushed for prompt completion; work was exhaustive as certain sequences needed revision.;;; A new team led by David Lipman, Davis Doi, and Larry Houston would finish twenty-six more for broadcast as a separate series with alternate character design.; This plan was negated following Time Warner's acquisition of Turner, leading to their release as ''Real Adventures''.; Completed episode scripts numbered roughly thirty-five pages each.;;;

Producers contracted seven studios to animate the first season. An international team handled digital post-production and QuestWorld scenes, while Japanese and Korean animators drew traditional cel sequences.; Over a quarter of the first season's footage was digitally inked and painted &quot;to enhance the background and the atmospheric elements.&quot;; Producers applied the process &quot;in excess of 20 hours per episode...just for effects...We added light effects, rain, snow, glitter, reflections, fog, [which] made things much more realistic.&quot;; Japan-based Mook Studios exclusively animated the second season.; Several composers wrote incidental music and cues, and Gary Lionelli rearranged the original ''Jonny Quest'' theme. Composer Guy Moon considered working for the show the &quot;hardest thing I've done in my life&quot;, as the producers &quot;want it big, Big, BIG.&quot;;; &quot;They want a big orchestra with a good synth rig...It's great because they push me so much I'll probably replace my whole demo reel with ''Jonny Quest'' music. It's hip and it's current.&quot;; The show's format dictated that titles be aired first, then the teaser, first act, and second act with commercial breaks in between.; Producers originally intended to air the teaser before the titles.; Despite censoring of death by firearms (replaced with darts), ''Real Adventures'' maintained the classic show's realistic violence, featuring off-screen deaths of villains and allies.;;;;

=International marketing campaign=
Hanna-Barbera leveraged the series in forty countries and fourteen languages to crack international markets.;;; Brandweek reported in 1995 that the show's budget, including merchandising and promotional costs, topped $40 million.; Hanna-Barbera presented ''Real Adventures'', the live-action film, and release of episodes on VHS as part of a &quot;Year of ''Jonny Quest''&quot; marketing campaign.;;; The push echoed 1994's &quot;Year of the ''Flintstones''&quot; and 1995's &quot;Year of ''Yogi Bear''&quot;.;;;;;; Director Richard Donner and producer Lauren Shuler Donner optioned the rights for the live action film.;; Slated to begin production in mid-1995, filming was pushed back to 1996 and ultimately never began.;;; Hanna-Barbera advertised ''Real Adventures'' as the &quot;next evolution in children's programming...[redefining] television animation for the next generation.&quot;;; The company hosted a 1995 discussion with Peter Lawrence and Takashi at Yanceyville and later aired previews at United States waterpark events.;;;;

=Network run and ratings=
Turner aired ''Real Adventures'' seven nights a week on three of its networks—TBS, TNT, and Cartoon Network—for an unprecedented twenty-one weekly showings.;; Turner's marketers surmised, &quot;the audiences of kids watching TNT in the morning or TBS in the afternoon and...Cartoon in prime time and late night are close to mutually exclusive,&quot; with Seibert adding that &quot;different audiences watch the networks at different times.&quot;;;; ''Real Adventures'' premiered August 26, 1996, three months after a twenty-hour &quot;Farewell Marathon&quot; of original ''Quest''.;; The show averaged a 2.0 Nielsen rating over August and September 1996, considered a strong start for an animated series.;; ''Real Adventures'';';s merchandise performed poorly, and it failed to build consistent ratings or support from the teenage demographic—though it did attract adult audiences.;;; Turner tried to revive interest in February 1997 with a contest for an adventurous trip to Jamaica and free merchandise.;; Cartoon Network did not order new episodes beyond the fifty-second and has not released new ''Quest'' material since.; 

=Reruns=
Reruns aired for two years on Toonami until September 24, 1999, on Cartoon Network in other formats until December 14, 2002, and on CNX until 2003. They also appeared on FOX Kids, with the first airing on November 22, 1999. FOX's reruns of the show ended on 
May 26, 2000, and had not been renewed since then.

=QuestWorld=
Producers cultivated an element of virtual reality through QuestWorld, a cyberspace simulation rendered with three-dimensional computer animation and motion capture.; QuestWorld was designed as an extension of contemporary technology, similar to the classic series's high-tech lasers, satellites, and robots.; Seibert traced its origin to &quot;the same problem that James Bond [has]...When you look at even his newest gadgets, they're somewhat quaint.&quot;; Planners derived inspiration from cyberpunk novels written by Neal Stephenson and William Gibson, including ''Snow Crash''.; QuestWorld characters were created as wire frame models, augmented with faces scanned from clay busts, then digitally painted and inked.; Animation company Buzz F/X, based in Montreal and Santa Monica, created first season sequences.;; Work began in April 1996 with the opening titles—a gliding journey through a canyon of green, cartographic lines with scenes illuminated upon the walls. Budgetary constraints forbade the supervision of experienced animators in Montreal, allegedly &quot;why the opening sequence is so ugly&quot; according to a Buzz F/X animator.; Short segments of action and adventure called ''Quest Bytes'' were produced to follow episodes.

Work on ''Escape to Questworld'' and ''Trouble on the Colorado'' followed; animators worked &quot;12 hours a day, 6 days a week in a small garage&quot; with inadequate computers.; Buzz F/X augmented the small team in July with ten recruits, but only two were experienced. Amateur employees struggled with lighting and syncing jerky motion capture from the House of Moves in Venice Beach.; By August, the team worked &quot;14 hours a day, 7 days a week,&quot; including full nights and mornings.; After two more episodes, Buzz F/X terminated its unprofitable contract with Hanna-Barbera, which hired Blur Studio to finish season two.; Blur used Intergraph hardware; its sharp performance deadlines and visible usage attracted press attention and sealed an amicable relationship with Hanna-Barbera.;;;; Both companies produced in total roughly 100 minutes of computer animation for QuestWorld—more than ''Toy Story''.;

Creative direction
The show's premise is that Dr. Quest, a famous phenomenologist, investigates mysterious occurrences and exotic locales with his son, Jonny Quest, bodyguard Race Bannon, Race's daughter Jessie, assistant Hadji Singh, and pet bulldog Bandit.;;; Peter Lawrence set the story a few years after the classic series, with Jonny and his friends now teenagers.; Lawrence aimed to use &quot;existing, real phenomenon&quot;—such as the &quot;Airstrips of Nazca, the Ruins of Teotihuacan or the possible existence of Giant Squid&quot;—to capture the curiosity of audiences.; Stressing that &quot;plausibility is a keynote&quot;, he suggested coverage of real-world enigma, cryptozoology, exotic locales, or fictional but &quot;believable&quot; mysteries.; The Quests would also find challenge in the virtual environment of QuestWorld, and frequently encounter the villainous Jeremiah Surd and Ezekiel Rage. Paralyzed years prior by Race Bannon's SWAT team, Surd would try to exact revenge through technology, while Rage—a former government agent left for dead on a botched mission—would try to destroy the world with nuclear terrorism. The Quests would sparingly fight &quot;monster[s] of the week...simply out to get [them]&quot;, instead battling antagonists who are not &quot;necessarily malevolent&quot; and whose conflicts lay in &quot;personal objective or ambition...opposed by Dr. Quest.&quot;; Lawrence stationed the family at a new compound on the coast of Maine, replete with &quot;houses, barns and workshops.&quot;; Rooms suited for each character included a library for Dr. Quest, workshop for Jonny, computer-equipped den for Jessie, dojo and gym for Race, and lighthouse lookout for Hadji's meditation.; Lawrence equipped Dr. Quest with a fleet of air, land, and sea vehicles, including a World War II-era biplane and state-of-the-art catamaran named ''Questor'' with diving bells and smaller research vessels stored in the hulls.;;; More emphasis would be placed on Jonny than in the classic ''Quest'', with Seibert summarizing the shift:

;}}

=Characters=
Hadji, Jessie, and Jonny from the season one episode ''Expedition to Khumbu''
Seibert explained Jonny's age, 14, as one in which &quot;you think you can solve problems like an adult, but you may go get yourself into trouble.&quot;; Lawrence gave Jonny &quot;a straight-ahead, right-on attitude...His life is cool and he embraces it wholeheartedly.&quot;; Lawrence and later writers emphasized that Jonny was &quot;more a Man-Of-Action in training...than an intellectual,&quot; and created tension by contrasting his father's academic leanings with Jonny's affinity for Race's lifestyle.; Hadji, age 16, became Dr. Quest's personal assistant, who &quot;does not have his mentor's formal education in the sciences but...shares his burning interest in archaeology, anthropology and...the paranormal.&quot;; A Sikh and student yogin, he exhibited a &quot;fatalistic and accepting attitude to whatever is happening...[starting] from the philosophical point of view that everything is as it's supposed to be.&quot;; Hadji often used wise aphorisms, taken from &quot;any culture or any source...Sometimes it will baffle Jonny.&quot;; Lawrence cut Hadji's classic telekinesis to align his abilities with realistic yogin practices. &quot;He doesn't say things like 'Sim, Sim Sala Bim' anymore,&quot; season one voice actor Michael Benyaer explained. &quot;The writers and producers actually researched the actual yogic powers. He can do more plausible stuff. There is an episode where Hadji pretends to stop his breathing so that the bad guys think he is dead.&quot;;;

Jessie Bannon, age 15, was characterized as &quot;just as tough...smarter...[and] more thoughtful&quot; than Jonny, and &quot;more in tune with Hadji&quot;. She was &quot;more of an egghead&quot; who elected to spend time with Dr. Quest as Jonny did with Race.; Her father, age 38, retained his classic &quot;laconic sense of humor&quot; and &quot;fearless and utterly dependable&quot; nature.; Race Bannon retired from government work due to ethical scruples with his former intelligence agency.; Writers noted that Race &quot;can't help being the overprotective Dad&quot; for Jessie, while Jonny is &quot;the boy Race never had.&quot;; His new western accent and elaborate similes were met with resistance from older ''Quest'' fans.; Dr. Benton Quest, age 55, retired from government research and operated from the &quot;Quest Compound&quot; on the coast of Maine.; &quot;Driven by his desire to know more about...the inexplicable worldwide phenomena which he investigates,&quot; he was &quot;consulted by individuals, governments and corporations to investigate any mysterious chain of events.&quot;; Described as &quot;single-minded—almost to the point of obsession—in his pursuit of knowledge,&quot; he often encountered trouble as &quot;his drive to learn blanks out more basic instincts like self-preservation.&quot;; Jessie appreciated his &quot;ponderous&quot; sense of humor.; Lawrence removed Bandit's clownish origins and presented him in useful roles.; Summarizing the group's behavior, he wrote:



=Second season changes=
The Quest team's second season designs, from episode ''Without a Trace''
In response to preliminary criticism over character changes, Fred Seibert hoped ''Real Adventures'' would find success as new interpretations of comic book heroes had done.;;; Notwithstanding his desire, season two directors Larry Houston and Davis Doi changed the writing and Takashi's designs to a more &quot;classic&quot; feel.; Writer Glenn Leopold revived Hadji's &quot;latent psionic powers&quot;—including spoon-bending and &quot;rope tricks&quot;—as he felt the first season's realism was &quot;not that interesting to watch...the more visual his 'power', the better.&quot;; All characters lost a year in age; Jonny was now 13.; Writer Lance Falk returned Race to governmental guard duty, sealed by an episodic visit with classic spymaster Phil Corven.;;; While Race lost his western accent, Dr. Quest gained his classic red hair and rudimentary combat skills.;; Initially resistant to Jessie, Falk came to regard her as the &quot;missing piece needed to complete the Quest family,&quot; and Leopold added slight romantic overtones to episodes.; Fans complained about changes to Jessie, criticized as a damsel in distress with stereotypically female pink clothes.; Falk defended his portrayal as giving her realistic, &quot;human&quot; fears.;; An academic paper on animated gender stereotypes later pointed out that Jonny saved Jessie from danger six times during a second season show.;;

=Greater creative liberties=
Second season writers took greater creative liberties with ''Real Adventures'', invoking ghosts, other dimensions, and megalomaniacal schemes. Whereas Peter Lawrence wrote &quot;lots of spiritual, mystical plots...[where] they uncover a lot of hoaxes,&quot; Falk and Leopold geared towards a &quot;slam-bang adventure show with real monsters&quot; and furthered the &quot;action's emphasis more [on] Jonny&quot; and his friends.;; Falk explained, &quot;...if [accuracy] gets in the way of 'cool'...cool's gonna win out every time (as it should),&quot; emphasizing that &quot;''Jonny Quest'' is a show with one foot in the ''fantastic'', and one foot solidly based in reality.&quot;;; Opposed to the ubiquitous use of QuestWorld, the new team was nonetheless contractually obligated to use the concept in their work.; Falk felt that virtual reality paradoxically undermined the show's &quot;strong connection to reality,&quot; and suggested that after so many dangerous incidents Dr. Quest would have simply turned the system off.; Writers brought back several classic characters, including Pasha the Peddler, Jezebel Jade, and Dr. Zin.; Falk also honored ''Quest'' creator Doug Wildey by creating an eponymous grandfather for Jonny in the episode ''Nuclear Netherworld''.; The team created Estella Velasquez as Jessie's mother to retcon the telefilms, as Jade &quot;would never get married to anybody.&quot;; Writers eliminated villains Rage and Surd in favor of new adversaries.; Comparing ''Quest'' without Zin to &quot;James Bond without S.P.E.C.T.R.E.&quot;, Falk penned a season finale featuring classic robot spies and a visceral fight between Dr. Quest and Zin.; With the Maine compound destroyed in the aftermath, Falk planned to resuscitate Palm Key as the ''Quest'' home in new episodes. However, Cartoon Network did not renew ''Real Adventures'', despite a pledge to explore the history of Jonny's mother in the season premiere.;

Cast
The first season of ''Real Adventures'' featured J. D. Roth as Jonny, George Segal as Dr. Quest, Robert Patrick as Race, Jesse Douglas as Jessie, and Michael Benyaer as Hadji. A childhood fan of the original series, J.D. Roth remarked that he was &quot;so into the idea of what they were trying to accomplish that I had to be Jonny.&quot;; Roth was attracted by Jonny's characterization as &quot;a real kid, who has real instincts, who wants to help people. He has star quality.&quot;;; He found that &quot;[Jonny] doesn't think about how he's going to do it; he just wants to go do it...he is full of enthusiasm, and it is infectious.&quot;; Roth admired the show's educational quality, something he had tried to integrate in his personal television pilots.; He later expressed that &quot;Jonny is crazy about his dad. He looks up to him and thinks he is the smartest man ever to walk to face of the earth. He has the typical teenage relationship with his father, but his father definitely sees something in him. Dr Quest knows that Jonny is going to be something really special.&quot;; Michael Banyaer enjoyed playing Hadji—&quot;[he] is one of the few roles for an ethnic actor that is not a bad guy. I mean, how many East Indian heroes have been on television? Hadji is for the sensitive kids out there. He is the outsider in all of us.&quot;; A Star Wars fan, Banyaer also relished the opportunity to work with Mark Hamill for ''In the Realm of the Condor''.;

When asked about Jessie's inclusion, Jesse Douglas stated, &quot;I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard for the rest of the storyline.&quot;; Roth supported her, claiming that &quot;Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with...I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend.&quot;; Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults &quot;there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on.&quot;;; Hanna-Barbera bought out the first cast's contracts as part of second season changes and hired new actors.; Season two featured Quinton Flynn as Jonny, John de Lancie as Dr. Quest, Granville Van Dusen (first two episodes) and Robert Foxworth as Race, Jennifer Hale as Jessie, and Rob Paulsen as Hadji. Don Messick attempted to reprise his classic role as Dr. Quest, but was forced into retirement after suffering a stroke during early sessions.; His recorded dialogue included work on the episode ''Rock of Rages'', one line of which survived overdubbing by de Lancie.;; Van Dusen voiced Bannon in the 1986 ''Quest'' series, and Foxworth took over the part coincidentally after an audition for Dr. Quest.; Paulsen previously voiced Hadji in the two ''Quest'' telefilms.;;

Marketing
Turner launched a massive marketing campaign to promote ''Real Adventures'' with a &quot;small army&quot; of thirty-three licensees and sponsors.;; The company invested $20 million towards merchandising and promotion, with each network spending $5-7 million.;; Other reports pegged the budget at $40 or even $100 million.;;; Wall Street Journal called ''Quest'' a &quot;property to watch&quot; in 1995; People and Good Housekeeping considered it a surefire blockbuster.;;;;; A digital style guide with a collection of ''Quest'' artwork, coloring instructions, and product mock-ups was given to merchandisers.;; Pillsbury included $3 mail-in rebates for future ''Quest'' videos, display contests, and instant coupon offers on over twenty million packages.; Campbell Soup Company released six holographic miniature posters on the same number of SpaghettiOs cans. Over five thousand Pizza Hut restaurants held a two month long give-away of figurines with meals. Galoob secured figurine licensing rights in 1995 and created a product line of vehicles, figures, and Micro Machines for fall 1996 release.; The figures were not popular outside of the United States; new designs were shelved and the line discontinued in 1997.;;;;;; General Mills outfitted boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch with offers for tee shirts and other items.; Upper Deck Company used art, sketches, and plots from the first season to create a card collection with sixty individual pieces. Turner also marketed W. C. Bradley Co.|Zebco fishing poles bearing the ''Quest'' logo.;;

Several products were listed in the &quot;Quest Adventure Value Pack&quot; catalogue, which encouraged $40 savings through combined purchases.; Among other products, the catalogue was packaged with Kid Rhino's cassette audio adventure based on the episode ''Return of the Anasazi''.;; The show's credits advertised a soundtrack available from Rhino, but such a release was never otherwise promoted or sold.; Hanna-Barbera set up the website ''Questworld.com'' as the show's internet hub, presenting it as if it were written by members of the Quest team.;; In keeping with the show's educational, real-world premise, the site hosted several links to academic, archaeological, and exploratory websites.;; The marketing campaign culminated with the release of eight season one episodes over VHS with suggested retail prices of $12.98 per unit.; The size of the push left one newspaper reviewer wondering, &quot;are [the Quests] back because they're too cool to die, or because they're too well known to be squandered as a licensing product?&quot;; Hanna-Barbera chief Fred Seibert expected high sales and success:



Dark Horse Comics composed a twelve issue series released over the show's first run, as publisher Mike Richardson felt that &quot;the massive exposure Turner is giving Quest...could truly drive traffic into the comic stores. The potential is staggering.&quot;;; Kate Worley wrote the ''Real Adventures'' series while Francisco Lopez illustrated.; Editor Phil Amara stressed that they would endeavor to tribute the classic ''Jonny Quest'' as well.; The company worked with Galoob to ship comic shop locator phone numbers and URLs to previews with figurines. Dark Horse also released a special three-issue series through mail offers with over eight million boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios as advertised on television.;; Three two-page &quot;mini-adventures&quot; packaged with existing Dark Horse products preceded the series release.; The issue ''Countdown to Chaos'', featuring season two villain General Vostok, was nearly adapted into a season two episode.; A lifetime fan of ''Quest'', Eisner Award-winning Paul Chadwick drew the cover of the final issue, depicting Jonny's descent into a cave on Easter Island.;;;; Terry Bisson and other authors working under the alias &quot;Brad Quentin&quot; also produced eleven original novellas, continuing exploration of adventure and virtual reality themes.;;;; One critic appreciated that the books' original stories may have drawn kids to reading.;; Excepting the comics, no merchandise with season two's designs or characters was produced.

=Cover-up at Roswell=
Exploring Tanzania (from episode ''Ndovu's Last Journey'') in the game

Virgin Interactive produced an adventure game for the series named ''Cover-Up At Roswell'', released in August 1996 for $34.95.;;; Turner New Media announced that Virgin's &quot;non-violent adventure games suitable for pre-teen girls and boys, fits...our vision of what family entertainment should be.&quot;; Developers recycled fifty minutes of footage and art from six season one episodes to construct a new story concerning alien artifacts and an alien's liberation from an autopsy at the Pentagon.;;; The Quests are hindered by Jeremiah Surd and the Men in Black of General Tyler, who plan to misuse the technology.; Gameplay consists of clicking areas on images of locations to navigate paths in search of the objects.; Occasionally, players encounter mini games, such as the task of guiding a diving bell away from rocks or shooting rats with a slingshot. Virgin designed certain segments in 3D and included special Chromatek plastic viewing glasses with game copies. Footage voices were dubbed over by Michael Banyaer as Hadji, Charles Howerton as Dr. Quest, and the season two cast. The game's music featured a &quot;high-intensity orchestral sound&quot; prone to monotony.; One reviewer cited a lack of replay value and different modes of difficulty as weaknesses, but concluded that ''Roswell'' offered &quot;good entertainment and variety&quot;.; Critics were divided over the puzzles' difficulty, naming it both &quot;ingenious&quot; and &quot;elementary&quot;.;;; Peter Scisco of ComputerLife and FamilyPC's testers criticized some of the puzzles for relying on &quot;reflexes, not logical thinking.&quot;;; Contrarily, Entertainment Weekly's reviewer found the challenges too easy, considering them unimaginative &quot;Pac-Man rip-offs and dopey jigsaws,&quot; and rated the game B+.;; Scisco appreciated the nonviolent content and the inclusion of Jessie's strong female character, but named the extra-terrestrial story &quot;too familiar&quot;.;

=Quest World Adventure=
Hanna-Barbera staged an international contest in February 1997 called &quot;Quest World Adventure&quot;, the prize being a trip to a secret island (Jamaica) in July.;; Commercials instructed fans to mail in episodes' geographical destinations during sweeps week.; Advertisements appeared on Time Warner's television channels, in Sports Illustrated for Kids, DC Comics publications, radio stations, and Warner Brothers stores.; Turner encouraged local cable operators to submit their own spots, generating 34,000 ads among 174 cable systems for a total of $3.4 million cross-channel media support.; 50,000 children with a median age of ten entered the competition, and 20,000 answered correctly.;; Turner randomly selected ten viewers from the United States and nine from Latin America and Asia as winners.; They and 200 others received ''Quest''-themed adventure packs, including a backpack, flashlight and siren, travel journal, pen, T-shirt, and glow sticks.; Cartoon Network aired the names of winning children on a special feature in which Jeremiah Surd issued personal threats.;;

The nineteen winners received travel itineraries for an all-expenses-paid trip to Ocho Rios, Jamaica with up to three family members.; Planners kept the destination secret until shortly before travel.;; In Jamaica, kids combated Surd's &quot;environmental terrorism&quot; by preventing him from finding the Jamaican &quot;wikt:Irie|Irie&quot; stones.; Children received clues on the mission by e-mail seemingly written by Jonny Quest.; Posing as the kids' allies, network employees prepared clues, buried treasure, and hosted barbecues, reggae concerts, and rafting trips.; Participants searched for the stones at the White River, Dunn's River Falls, and Prospect Plantation; hosts filmed the proceedings for possible future promotions.; The quest centered on cerebral challenges—the kids reportedly had to &quot;really think in order to solve the riddle and save the world.&quot;; Attendees also learned about the history and ecology of Jamaica.; The adventure doubled the show's ratings for February sweeps and tripled ''Questworld.com'';';s hits threefold.; Brandweek magazine awarded it the year's top honors for a global marketing promotion.;

Critical reception
Dr. Quest and Jessie, a subject of initial debate, in season one's ''The Darkest Fathoms''
Announcement of Jessie Bannon's inclusion caused a backlash among certain ''Quest'' fans; TV Guide's editors feared that Jonny and Jessie would become romantically entangled.;; The television magazine declared that &quot;Jonny &amp; Co. have always gotten along just fine without any icky females,&quot; and a Miami Herald columnist called her an &quot;effort to rewrite the past to conform to the socio-political mandates of the present...This is PC—pretty crazy—run amok.&quot;;; Conversely, Billboard magazine welcomed the change to the otherwise all-male cast.; Fred Seibert responded by stating, &quot;Jessie is a little older and smarter than Jonny...We're not doing ''Moonlighting'' here.&quot;; The fiasco subsided after ''Cyber Insects'' aired, in which the Atlanta Journal-Constitution declared Jessie to be &quot;no 'icky girl'...Not only does she save Jonny's life when disturbingly large fire ants attack, but she also teaches him patience.&quot;;; A test screening of ''Cyber Insects'' to 30-35 year old males revealed that though some questioned her addition, most &quot;understood that just like the [original] series, [the update] is a reflection of its times.&quot;; Following its debut, Cinefantastique wrote that ''Real Adventures'' remained &quot;true to the familiar formula&quot; of the classic series, and praised an &quot;impressive cast&quot; with People magazine, which specified George Segal.;;; Another critic affirmed that ''Real Adventures'' maintained the violence and off-screen deaths of classic ''Quest''—as even the opening titles featured &quot;explosions, murder and mayhem&quot;—and recommended the show to &quot;die-hard adult fans&quot;.; Chicago's Daily Herald called the first episode &quot;vintage ''Quest''&quot;.; The Panama City Times-Herald echoed this position:



An editor for The Washington Post judged the first season as &quot;grittier and more lifelike&quot; than the original ''Quest''.;; Chicago Tribune critic Allan Johnson agreed that ''Real Adventures'' was less &quot;way-out&quot; and contrasted the two shows in detail.;; TV Guide joined by applauding the writing as &quot;miles deeper and darker than on the old show&quot;; the magazine's critic was impressed by Hadji's quotations.; Johnson approved of the age jump, as Jonny and Hadji were now old enough to be part of the action.; He considered Jessie &quot;cool...she gives Jonny grief just because she can, and she's not afraid of the action.&quot;; Conversely, he did not enjoy the &quot;toned down&quot; portrayal of Race Bannon.; The authors of 1998's ''Saturday Morning Fever'' felt the show seemed to lack &quot;the sense of why the original was so successful.&quot;;; They praised Jessie and her resemblance to Dr. Quest, but lambasted the packaging of both seasons under one name. The authors ultimately preferred the second, as it contained more classic references and characters.; Hanna-Barbera founder Joseph Barbera considered ''Real Adventures'' a &quot;disaster&quot; because &quot;they changed was the story and the character&quot;.;; He continued, &quot;that's their business. Everybody needs to do their own thing.&quot;; People praised Turner's shift from the &quot;politically correct claptrap&quot; of ''Captain Planet and the Planeteers'', giving ''Real Adventures'' a B grade as &quot;children's programming the way it oughta be.&quot;; Peter Scisco of ComputerLife appreciated that the team &quot;rely on their brains, not mutant superpowers.&quot;;

The Toronto Star scathingly criticized the show for hosting &quot;facile plots heavily laced with jarring science fiction and incongruous computer animation,&quot; and called QuestWorld a &quot;poorly explained techno-gimmick.&quot;; Though praising the computer animation, The Star regarded traditional sequences as &quot;flat and textureless, with minimal characterization, unnaturally stiff movement and poor execution of shading and shadow.&quot;; Ted Cox of the Chicago Daily Herald disagreed, lauding &quot;realistic&quot; traditional and digital animation—&quot;such as the play of light on the ocean.&quot;; Cox conceded that in some spots, motion seemed &quot;remarkably uneven&quot;.; TV Guide also found the animation to be somewhat flat, but considered the sound effects and backgrounds &quot;state-of-the-art.&quot;; Greg Aaron of HotWired praised the franchise's return, but warned against QuestWorld hype, arguing that &quot;it will take more than visual sophistication to hook today's viewers&quot;.; Senior vice president of production Sherry Gunther admitted that the motion capture technology was &quot;best reserved for recording broad movements...because the technology is still a little crude.&quot;;

Alberto Menache expanded this criticism of QuestWorld in the book ''Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Video Games'', labeling the virtual reality simulation a &quot;failure&quot; laden with &quot;many mistakes.&quot;;; He explained that the size difference between the motion capturers and the characters caused unsteady animation and shaking—consequently mismatching interaction with props or uneven terrain.; Menache levied blame upon the show's budget, which did not allow for digital post-production and review. Producers instead expected &quot;plug-and-play&quot; results straight from the capture studio.; Menache concluded that the QuestWorld sequences were the result of a &quot;pipeline set up for mass production&quot; with little testing or advance planning.; These criticisms mirrored the comments of Buzz F/X animator Francois Lord, who revealed that the company's Montreal animators were inexperienced and forced to deliver on rushed schedules.; Contrasting their work with Blur Studio's, he pointed out that amid more experienced workers, Blur &quot;had twice as [much] time as we did and twice as [much] money.&quot;; Menache was less critical of the facial capture, considering it &quot;medium-quality...but still acceptable for the kind of television budget this project had.&quot;;
