History

:''For the history of matches versus local rivals Norwich City F.C., see the East Anglian Derby.''
;
The club was founded as an amateur side in 1878.Known as Ipswich Association F.C. until 1888 when they merged with Ipswich Rugby Club to form Ipswich Town Football Club,;; the team won a number of local cup competitions, including the Suffolk Challenge Cup and the Suffolk Senior Cup.;;They joined the Southern Amateur League in 1907 and, with results improving steadily, became champions in the 1921-22 in English football|1921&amp;ndash;22 season.;;The club won the league a further three times, in 1929-30 in English football|1929&amp;ndash;30, 1932-33 in English football|1932&amp;ndash;33 and 1933-34 in English football|1933&amp;ndash;34, before becoming founder members of the Eastern Counties Football League at the end of the 1934-35 in English football|1934&amp;ndash;35 season. A year later, the club turned professional and joined the Southern League, which they won in its first season and finished third in the next.;

Ipswich ; were ; elected to The Football League on 30 May, 1938, and played in Division Three (South) until the end of the 1953-54 in English football|1953&amp;ndash;54 season, when they won the title and promotion to Division Two. The club were immediately relegated back to Division Three (South) the following year at the end of a poor season, but made better progress after Scott Duncan was replaced as team manager by Alf Ramsey in August 1955.The club won the Division Three (South) title again in 1956-57 in English football|1956&amp;ndash;57, and returned to the higher division. This time, Ipswich established themselves in Division Two, and ; won promotion to the top level of English football, Division One, in 1960-61 in English football|1960&amp;ndash;61.;;

In the top flight for the first time, Ipswich became Champions of the Football League at the first attempt in 1961-62 in English football|1961&amp;ndash;62.;As English league champions, they qualified for the European Cup, defeating Maltese side Floriana 14&amp;ndash;1 on aggregate before losing to AC Milan.;Ramsey quit the club in April 1963 to take charge of the England football team; after the team won the 1966 World Cup, he received a knighthood for &quot;services to football&quot; in 1967.;;Ramsey was replaced by Jackie Milburn,;under whose leadership fortunes on the pitch plummeted. Two years after winning the league title, Ipswich slipped down to the Second Division in 1963-64 in English football|1964, conceding 121 league goals in 42 games.;;Milburn quit after just one full season and was replaced by Bill McGarry in 1964.; The club remained in the Second Division for four years until McGarry guided Ipswich to promotion along with his assistant Sammy Chung in the 1967-68 in English football|1967&amp;ndash;68 season, winning the division by a single point ahead of Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers.;; McGarry left to manage Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves and was replaced by Bobby Robson in January 1969.;

Robson led Ipswich to two major trophies and several seasons in top flight European football. The successful period began in 1973 when the club won the Texaco Cup and finished fourth in the league, qualifying for the UEFA Cup for the first time. By the late 1970s, Robson had built a strong side with talent in every department, introducing the Dutch pair Arnold Muhren and Frans Thijssen to add flair to a team that featured British internationals including John Wark, Terry Butcher and Paul Mariner.;;Ipswich regularly featured in the top five of the league and in the UEFA Cup.;At their peak in 1980 they beat Manchester United 6&amp;ndash;0 at Portman Road, a game where United goalkeeper Gary Bailey also saved three penalties.;;Major success came in 1978 when Ipswich beat Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal at Wembley Stadium to win their only FA Cup trophy,;; the triumph was followed by a UEFA Cup victory in 1981. The club also finished as league runners-up in 1981 and 1982.;;;;;;

Robson's success with Ipswich prompted The Football Association to seek his services as manager of the English national team, and in August 1982 he was replaced at the club by his assistant Bobby Ferguson, having taken up the F.A.'s offer .; Under Ferguson, Town finished mid-table twice,;;;; but worsening performances meant that they began to struggle in the top division. Ipswich were finally relegated to the second tier (then called Division Two) in 1985-86 in English football|1985&amp;ndash;86.;;;;Ferguson, who had remained in charge despite the relegation, resigned in May 1987 after reaching the promotion play-offs but failing to return the club to the first division.;Ipswich Town were then managed by John Duncan for three years until he was replaced by former West Ham United F.C.|West Ham boss John Lyall in May 1990.;;Lyall guided Ipswich to the Second Division championship and promotion to the new FA Premier League, ready for the 1992-93 in English football|1992&amp;ndash;93 season.;;Suffering only two league defeats before the New Year,;; Ipswich started the season well and were fourth in the Premier League in January 1993, but a dip in form during the final weeks of the season saw Ipswich finish in a disappointing 16th place.;; Poor form continued into the following season and Ipswich only avoided relegation that year when Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United suffered a last-gasp 3&amp;ndash;2 defeat at Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea on the final day of the season.;
Six months later, fortunes on the pitch had not improved, and Lyall was sacked as Ipswich manager in December 1994 with the club rooted to the bottom of the Premiership. 

Lyall's successor, George Burley, was unable to turn team performances around, and Ipswich suffered a Premiership record defeat, 9&amp;ndash;0, at Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United, on their way to relegation.;;;;Back in the second tier of the league, Burley led the club to three consecutive promotion playoffs, but they were to endure defeats in all three semi-finals.Ipswich finally returned to the Premiership in 2000 after coming from behind to beat Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley 4&amp;ndash;2 in the last Division One playoff final at Wembley Stadium.;Ipswich performed well in the Premiership in their first season with Burley's side finishing in an impressive fifth place&amp;mdash;being pipped by Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool on the last day of the season for a place in the Champions League. Consolation was a UEFA Cup place and FA Premier League Manager of the Year Award for Burley.;;

This spell in the top division ended after two seasons and the loss of income due to relegation led to the club going into financial administration.;;There was the minor consolation of again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, this time via the UEFA Fair Play ranking, and Ipswich survived two ties before losing in the second round proper to Czech side FC Slovan Liberec.;;A poor start to the season, culminating in a 3&amp;ndash;0 defeat at Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town, meant that Burley was sacked in October 2002 after nearly eight years as manager.;;First team coach Tony Mowbray was given four games as caretaker manager, winning once, but he was ultimately replaced as manager by the former Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic, Everton F.C.|Everton and Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City manager Joe Royle, who had played for local rival Norwich City.;;Royle inherited a side struggling near the Division One relegation zone, but revived fortunes such that the team narrowly failed to reach the playoffs.;; The 2003-04 in English football|2003&amp;ndash;04 season saw the club come out of administration and continue to challenge for promotion back to the Premier League.;;They finished that season in fifth, but were defeated in the playoff semi-finals by West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United.;;

Narrowly missing automatic promotion in 2004-05 in English football|2004&amp;ndash;05, Royle took Ipswich once more to the play-offs, but once more they lost to West Ham United in the semi-finals.;;2005-06 in English football|2005&amp;ndash;06 saw a campaign plagued by injuries and Ipswich finished a disappointing 15th &amp;mdash; the club's lowest finish since 1966.;;Joe Royle resigned by mutual consent on 11 May, 2006.;;A month later, Jim Magilton was officially announced as the new manager and former Academy Director Bryan Klug was appointed to assist as first team coach.;;

As of 2007, the club has a board of twelve directors, including David Sheepshanks, Holly Bellingham ;;
, and Kevin Beeston.;;Previous directors include former Chairmen Patrick and John Cobbold,;; both of Tolly Cobbold; Harold Smith; and Richard Ryder.;;;;;;
In 2007 Ipswich became the first carbon neutral football club in England. This feat was achieved with the help of the fans and main sponsor e.on.In November 2007, the club were involved in takeover discussions with both business-man Marcus Evans and former Birmingham City F.C. director David Sullivan.;;;;
;

Colours and crest
One of Ipswich Town's nicknames is ''The Blues'', stemming from their traditional kit, which is predominantly blue.Since turning professional, Ipswich have used a number of alternate (or away) colours, including white, orange, red and black vertical stripes, claret and green, cream and black vertical stripes and dark blue and claret.;; 
Crest used from 1972 to 1995.
The shirts worn by players of Ipswich Town did not sport a crest until the mid-1960s, when they adopted a design featuring a gold lion rampant guardant on a red background on the left half and three gold ramparts on a blue background on the right half.;In 1972, the crest was redesigned as the result of a competition, won by the Treasurer of the Supporters Club, John Gammage.Each element of the new design was intended to represent the region.;;


The crest was modified in 1995 after consultation with a Supporters Forum, with the turrets of the Wolsey Gate moved to the top of the crest, the yellow background changed to red, the Suffolk Punch given a more dominant physique and the F.C. expanded to ''Football Club''.

In 2006, the club donated 500 orange and blue and white shirts to children in Iraq.;;

Stadia
Panorama of Portman Road, facing the North Stand
Between 1878 and 1884, Ipswich Town played at two grounds in the town, Broom Hill and Brook's Hall,;; but in 1884, the club moved to Portman Road and have played there ever since.;;At their new home, Ipswich became one of the first clubs to implement the use of goal nets, in 1890,; but the more substantial elements of ground development did not begin until, in 1901, a tobacco processing plant was built along the south edge of the ground. 

The first stand, a woodenstructure, was built on the Portman Road side of the pitch in 1905. In 1911 the roof was blown off,; and the ground was later commandeered by the British Army for the duration of the First World War.The club turned professional in 1936, and work began on the first bank of terracing at the north end of the pitch.The following year, on the back of winning the Southern League, a similar terrace was built at the southern &quot;Churchmans&quot; end.All sides were terraced by 1954, and floodlights were erected in 1959 for use in lower light conditions.;The two-tier Portman Stand was built along the east side of the ground in place of the existing terraces in 1971, and the west stand, then known as the &quot;Pioneer Stand&quot; as a result of the club's sponsorship by the electronics company Pioneer Corporation, was converted to all-seating in 1990.;Average and peak attendances from 1936.In 1990, following the recommendations of the Taylor Report in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster the previous year, the terraces in both the north and south stands were also converted to all-seating, creating the first complete all-seater stadium in the top flight of English football with a spectator capacity of 22,600.;

Success on the pitch lead to further investment in the infrastructure, with the club spending over £22&amp;nbsp;million on redeveloping both North and South stands, resulting in a current capacity of 30,311.In the past five years, statues of both Sir Alf Ramsey and Sir Bobby Robson have been unveiled outside the stadium.;;;;The playing surface at Portman Road is highly regarded and has been voted best pitch in the league on a number of occasions.;;The current groundsman, Alan Ferguson, has received a number of accolades, including both Premiership and Championship Groundsman of the Year.;;;;

Supporters

During the 2005-06 in English football|2005&amp;ndash;06 season, Ipswich Town recorded an average attendance of 24,252, approximately 80% of available capacity, the fourth-highest attendance in The Championship.;;The highest attendance of the season was 29,184 in the local derby against Norwich City.;; 

Locally, much is made of the informal title &quot;Pride of Anglia&quot;. Fans variously claim the title for either winning the East Anglian Derby, finishing highest in the league, having the better current league position, having the more successful club history or for reasons without any apparent logical basis. The club's main local rival is Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City. When the two teams meet it is known as the 'East Anglian Derby', or, informally, as the 'Old Farm Derby', a comic reference to the 'Old Firm Derby' played between Scottish teams Celtic F.C.|Celtic and Rangers F.C.|Rangers.;;Over the 134 matches played against Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City since 1902, Ipswich boasts the better record, having won 45% of the matches to Norwich's 37%.;;;This includes matches played at an amateur level.;

A recent nickname for Town is &quot;The Tractor Boys&quot;, which was coined during the club's brief successful period in the Premiership (2000-01 in English football|2000&amp;ndash;01) when the team regularly competed against more fashionable clubs. The nickname is an example of Self-deprecation|self-deprecating humour referring to Ipswich's industrial heritage.;The origins of the nickname are not certain, but the first generally-accepted use of the nickname appeared at a losing away game at Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City late in the 1998-99 in English football|1998&amp;ndash;99 season, with the home fans chanting &quot;no noise from the Tractor Boys&quot;, a name which stuck.;;Barracking by supporters of more established Premiership clubs during Town's spell in the Premiership lent the ironic chant: '1&amp;ndash;0 to the Tractor Boys' increased potency and publicity, and the nickname is commonly used by the media.;;;;Town manager Jim Magilton commented in the local press that he disliked the nickname, saying that it conjured up, &quot;images of carrot-crunching yokels&quot;;;;while players such as Matt Holland accepted the chant with good humour.;.

Statistics and records

:''For the most recent season statistics, see Ipswich Town F.C. season 2006-07''
League positions since 1938&amp;ndash;39 season.;''Coloured horizontal lines indicate league divisions.''
Mick Mills holds the record for Ipswich league appearances, having played 591 first-team matches between 1966 and 1982.The club's top league goalscorer is Ray Crawford, who scored 203 goals between 1958 and 1969, while Ted Phillips holds the record for the most goals scored in a season, 41 in the 1956-57 in English football|1956&amp;ndash;57 season in Division Three (South).Allan Hunter is the most capped player for the club, making 47 appearances for Northern Ireland.

The club's widest victory margins in the league have been their 7&amp;ndash;0 wins against Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth in the Second Division in 1964, against Southampton F.C.|Southampton in the First Division in 1974 and against West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion in the First Division in 1976.Their heaviest defeats in the league were 10&amp;ndash;1 against Fulham F.C.|Fulham in 1963 and 9&amp;ndash;0 against Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United in 1995.

Ipswich's record home attendance is 38,010 for a sixth round FA Cup match against Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United on 8 March, 1975.With the introduction of regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, it is unlikely that this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future.

The highest transfer fee received for an Ipswich player is £6.5&amp;nbsp;million, from Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United for Kieron Dyer in July 1999, while the most spent by the club on a player was £4.75&amp;nbsp;million for Matteo Sereni from U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria in July 2001 following the club's successful qualification for the UEFA Cup.;;
