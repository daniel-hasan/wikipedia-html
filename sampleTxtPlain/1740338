Grand Cross of the Order of the Phoenix, III. type
The Order of the Phoenix (Greek Τάγμα του Φοίνικος) is an Order (decoration) of Greece, established on May 13, 1926 by the republican government of the Second Hellenic Republic to replace the defunct Royal Order of George I. The Order was retained by the revived Monarchy after 1935, and continues to be awarded by the current Republic.

The Order is bestowed by the Greek government to Greek citizens who have excelled in the arts and literature, science, public administration, shipping, commerce, and industry. It is also awarded to foreigners who have helped raise Greece's international prestige.

Grades
The Order has five classes:
*''Grand Cross'' ('Μεγαλόσταυρος') - wears the badge of the Order on a sash on the right shoulder, and the star of the Order on the left chest; 
*''Grand Commander'' ('Ανώτερος Ταξιάρχης') - wears the badge of the Order on a necklet, and the star of the Order on the left chest; 
*''Commander'' ('Ταξιάρχης') - wears the badge of the Order on a necklet; 
*''Gold Cross'' ('Χρυσούς Σταυρός') - wears the badge on a ribbon on the left chest; 
*''Silver Cross'' ('Αργυρούς Σταυρός') - wears the badge on a ribbon on the left chest. 

Insignia
The badge of the Order is a white-enameled cross, in silver for the Silver Cross class, in gold for the higher classes, with the Phoenix (symbolizing the rebirth of the Hellenic nation) at the centre. A five-pointed star is at the upper arm of the cross. The first version of the Order (1926-1935) featured the letters &quot;E-T-T-A&quot; on each arm of the cross, the initials of the motto ''Εκ της τέφρας μου αναγεννάμαι'' (&quot;From my ashes I am reborn&quot;). During the Monarchy (1935-1974) the letters were removed and the badge was topped by a crown, while the badge's reverse side featured the monogram of the reigning monarch. The current version (since 1975) omits the crown, while the reverse features the Greek National Emblem with the words ''ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΗΜΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ'' (&quot;Hellenic Republic&quot;).

The ''star'' of the Order is a silver eight-pointed star with straight rays, with the phoenix at the centre; during the Monarchy it was topped by a crown.

The ''ribbon'' of the Order is orange with black edges.

Crossed swords on the insignia indicate that the award was made in the military division of the Order.
