Interstate H-201 (H-201) is an auxiliary Interstate highway located on the island of O‘ahu in the U.S. state of Hawaii.The H-201 is also known as the Moanalua Freeway.The 4-mile loop route connects exits 13 and 19 on Interstate H-1, passing Fort Shafter, Tripler Army Medical Center, and Red Hill.

Despite being designated an Interstate in 1989, until recently the route was a &quot;hidden&quot; Interstate signed only as Route 78.Interstate signs started appearing in mid-2004.The section of the Moanalua Freeway between Route 99 (Kamehameha Highway) and the western Interstate H-1 interchange remains designated as Route 78.

Letters in H-201 shields require thinner text, such as on signage like this one.

The length of H-201 was originally designated as Route 78.;;

The Federal Highway Administration approved the addition of Interstate H-201 to the Interstate Highway System on November 1, 1989.The Hawai‘i Department of Transportation asked that the Moanalua Freeway be reclassified as an Interstate so that the interchange with H-1 at the eastern end could conform to federal highway standards.At first, the highway was initially designated H-1A, but federal highway policy does not allow alphabetic suffixes in Interstate numbers.The final designation, H-201, conforms to the general rules for three-digit Interstate &quot;loop&quot; routes.

Until 2004, the state Department of Transportation chose not to sign H-201 as such, instead retaining the designation Route 78.Reasons given included:
* inability to render the new route number in a legible manner (it is necessary to use the thinnest font to render the number, as seen above, and the shield is wider than the standard interstate shield)
* encouraging motorists to use the newer and better designed H-1
* avoiding confusion with Interstate H-2

In July 2004, in conjunction with a major resurfacing of both sides of the freeway, it was decided to bring the signage in line with the official designation.
