History
West Virginia University was founded in 1867 as a land-grant university with the help of the Morrill Act, and was originally known as the Agricultural College of West Virginia. The name was changed in 1868.

On April 13, 2007, the Board of Governors voted 16-1 to elect Morgantown attorney Michael Garrison to succeed David Hardesty as the University's president.;[http://www.da.wvu.edu/show_article.php?&amp;story_id=27530 ''Daily Athenaeum'' (April 16, 2007): &quot;Garrison selected to be next WVU president&quot;, by Huong Le and Ry Rivard];The Faculty Senate voted to work with Garrison, but approved a vote of no confidence in the search.;[http://www.da.wvu.edu/show_article.php?&amp;story_id=28841 ''Daily Athenaeum'' (May 23, 2007): &quot;Faculty Senate votes 'no confidence'&quot;, by Tricia Fulks]; Garrison began work in July; his appointment officially began September 1, 2007.;[http://sundaygazettemail.com/section/News/2007071718 ''The Charleston Gazette'' (July 18, 2007): &quot;WVU governors speed up takeover date for president&quot;];

The University maintains seven libraries on its campuses (six of which are in Morgantown and the other in Charleston). These include the Downtown Campus Library, Evansdale Library, Health Sciences Library, Law Library, Math Library, Media Services, and the WVU Charleston Health Sciences Library. Collections include the Appalachian Collection, Book Depository, Digital Collections, Government Documents, West Virginia Historical Art Collection, Map Room, Myers Collection, Patent and Trademarks, Rare Books Collections, and Theses and Dissertations. West Virginia University libraries contain nearly 1.5 million printed volumes, 2.3 million microforms, more than 10,000 electronic journals, and computers with high speed Internet access.;[http://www.libraries.wvu.edu/friends/ West Virginia Collection Welcome Page];

In addition, the West Virginia and Regional History Collection, the world's largest collection of West Virginia related research material, is in the Wise Library on the Downtown Campus. According to the university;[http://www.libraries.wvu.edu/collections/wv.htm West Virginia Collection General Information];, the collection includes over 4,500,000 manuscript documents, 30,000 books, 15,000 pamphlets, 1,200 newspapers, 100,000 photographs and prints, 5,000 maps, and 25,000 microfilms, oral histories, films and folk music recordings. It is often called simply the &quot;West Virginia Collection.&quot; 

In 2007, the Princeton Review ranked West Virginia University libraries 5th best of 366 college libraries surveyed.

The university co-publishes, with the United Association for Labor Education, ''Labor Studies Journal''.

Campus
The Morgantown campus comprises three sub-campuses. The original main campus, typically called the Downtown Campus, is in the Monongahela River valley on the fringes of Morgantown. The Evansdale Campus, a mile and a half north/northwest, on a rise above the flood plain of the Monongahela River, was developed in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate a growing student population, since space for expansion is limited at the Downtown Campus. The Health Sciences Campus, in the same outlying area (but on the other side of a ridge), includes the WVU Health Sciences Center, Ruby Memorial Hospital, Chestnut Ridge Hospital, Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, UHA Physicians Office Center, Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute and, WVU Eye Institute, WVU Center on Aging, and WVU Children's Hospital.

The Health Sciences Campus is near Milan Puskar Stadium formerly Mountaineer Field.

PRT system/campus transportation

Because of WVU's distributed campuses (Downtown, Evansdale, and Health Sciences), the Personal Rapid Transit system, which has become a local showpiece, was built to link them. Boeing began construction on the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system in Morgantown, West Virginia in 1974. The unique aspect that makes the system &quot;personal&quot; is that a rider can tell the system which station is the destination and then he/she will be directed to a car that is bound only for that station.

The WVU PRT began operation in 1975, with U.S. President Richard Nixon's daughter, Tricia, aboard one of five prototype cars for a demonstration ride.;[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/4104/ WVU News and Information Services (July 13, 2004 press release): &quot;WVU PRT Station to Bear Name of People-Mover's Creator&quot;];. The PRT handles 16,000 riders per day (as of 2005) and uses approximately 70 cars. [There was an interruption in service during the 1978/1979 school year to allow system expansion from the Engineering station to new stations at the &quot;Towers&quot; dormitories and the WVU Medical Center. During this time, WVU provided bus service between campuses.] 

The system has 8.7 miles (approx. 14 km) of guideway track and five stations: Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, and Medical/Health Sciences. The vehicles are rubber-tired, but the cars have constant contact with a separate electrified rail. Steam heating keeps the elevated guideway free of snow and ice. To board the PRT, a rider can pay a nominal fare at the station or swipe his/her Mountaineer Card, which also functions as a school debit card, library card, and unlimited transit pass. Although most students use the PRT, this technology has not been replicated at other sites for various reasons, including the high cost of maintaining the heated track system in winter.

The PRT cars are painted in the school colors (blue with gold trim) and feature the University name and logo on the front. Inside, the seats are light beige fiberglass and the carpeting is blue. Each car has eight seats with an overall capacity of 20 people, including standing room. 

The National Society of Professional Engineers named the WVU PRT one of the top 10 engineering achievements of 1972,; and in 1998 ''The New Electric Railway Journal'' picked the WVU PRT over Walt Disney World's monorail as the greatest people mover in the United States.;

In 2006, the U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency dubbed WVU one of the best workplaces for commuters.;[http://www.nis.wvu.edu/2006/workplace_award.htm &quot;WVU Named One of 'Best Workplaces' for Commuters by EPA, DOT];

In addition to the PRT systm, students can utilize University-operated buses (during limited hours) or take advantage of the community's Mountain Line, which operates every day into the early morning hours. Students can use their Mountaineer Card to ride the Mountain Line bus for free. 

The Health Science Center also operates a shuttle service to help students, visitors and patients to get to and from the Health Science Center campus. Many non-University, private student housing communities in the area also operate a shuttle to campus/town and back to the housing community. 

Each autumn, during Mountaineer Week celebrations, a special PRT car is placed in front of the MountainLair student union where groups of students participate in the &quot;PRT Cram&quot; with the objective of squeezing in as many people as possible. A record of 97 was set in 2000.;;

Residential Education
Boreman Hall, one of the oldest residence halls on campus.
The Residential Education Program (ResEd), enacted in 1995, promotes &quot;student success by easing the transition from high school to college and to personalize the freshman experience.&quot;;[http://admissions.wvu.edu/undergraduate/discover/resident_faculty.asp WVU Admissions Dept.];During the Move-In or Welcome Weekend, returning upperclassmen volunteer to help the new students and are known as Residential Education HOTSHOTS. They help carry items, give directions, and answer questions. 

ResEd and the WVU First-Year Experience (FYE) focus on the university's 14 residence halls. Each hall is assigned a resident faculty leader (RFL, pronounced &quot;riffle&quot;) who oversees programming and lives in a house, usually next to the hall, where students hold Hall Council meetings and other events. Each hall is also assigned a residence hall coordinator (RHC) who works with the RFL and is responsible for daily operations, including enforcement of hall regulations. Along with these two positions are resident assistants (RAs) in most halls, graduate assistants (GAs)in some halls, and resident tutors (RTs) in Lincoln Hall. All three groups comprise students who have lived in the residence halls for at least one year and are responsible for the daily operations of one floor or area. In addition to this 24-hour staff, WVU Police Department officers are stationed in or nearby the halls at certain hours to deter any criminal activity and to provide necessary resources and assitance to the students and staff.

All residence halls offer peer tutors or other tutoring programs to assist students having academic difficulties.

Fraternity and sorority life
About 10 percent of West Virginia's students are involved in Greek life. Many of the fraternity houses are on High Street or North Spruce Street, while sorority houses are mainly on Spruce Street and Prospect Street. 

According to the University, there are 19 fraternities and 12 sororities at WVU. Following is a list of those that belong to the Inter-Fraternity Council and the National Panhellenic Conference (sororities).;http://www.arc.wvu.edu/NSS/AdmissionsFAQ/studentactivities.html; In recent years, many of the houses, as noted on the list, have been closed or condemned for various reasons.

Student newspaper

''The Daily Athenaeum'', nicknamed the ''DA'', is the 10th-largest newspaper in West Virginia. Offered free around campus, it generates income through advertisement sales. The paper began in 1887 as a weekly literary magazine, with writing, editing and production taken over by the newly formed School of Journalism in the 1920s. In 1970, the paper split from the School of Journalism and became an independent campus entity governed by the Student Publications Board. The ''DA'' was voted as the ''Princeton Review's'' 10th-best college newspaper in the United States in 2005, 15th in 2006, and 8th in 2007.;[http://www.princetonreview.com Princeton Review Homepage (Login Required)];

Sports traditions
=Flying WV=
The &quot;Flying WV&quot;
West Virginia University's logo is known as the &quot;Flying WV.&quot;

=Mountaineer mascot=
The Mountaineer was adopted in 1890 as the official school mascot and a new Mountaineer is selected each year during Mountaineer Week. Candidates must have at least a 2.5 GPA, write an essay about why they want to be the Mountaineer, and garner the most cheers during a designated home basketball game. The successful candidate is awarded the formal title of &quot;The Mountaineer of West Virginia University.&quot; Although men typically are chosen, there has been at least one woman selected (Natalie Tennant). The new Mountaineer receives a scholarship, a tailor-made buckskin suit with coonskin hat, and a period rifle and powder horn for discharging when the football team scores. The mascot travels with the sports teams throughout the academic year.

=&quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;=
The John Denver song &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; is commonly played at most home sporting events as well as other occasions on campus. In 1980, Denver helped dedicate the new Mountaineer Field, and performed the song as a sing-along with the crowd. It then became a tradition, after a victory, for fans to stay in the stands and sing it along with the football team.;''Sports Illustrated'' (month n.a., 2006): &quot;102 More Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate&quot;;
The Pride of West Virginia at the 2006 Nokia Sugar Bowl

=Mountaineer Marching Band=
The [http://www.wvuband.org WVU Marching Band], nicknamed &quot;The Pride of West Virginia,&quot; was formed in 1901 as an all-male ROTC band. It performs at every home football game and makes other appearances on- and off-campus throughout the year.

During its traditional pre-game performance, the band enters Mountaineer Field from end-zone tunnels to a spirited, 220-beats per minute &quot;run on&quot; cadence. The band plays several university songs and favorites including: &quot;Fight, Mountaineers,&quot; &quot;Mountain Dew,&quot; &quot;Simple Gifts&quot; (from ''Appalachian Spring''), &quot;West Virginia University's Alma Mater,&quot; &quot;The Star Spangled Banner,&quot; &quot;Country Roads,&quot; and &quot;Hail West Virginia!&quot; The band also forms several iconic images during its pre-game show including the #Flying WV|Flying WV, WVU, expanding circles, and an outline of the state of West Virginia. Each season's pre-game show is unique. 

WVU's marching band is one of the few to include a male baton twirler.;[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/4324/ WVU news release] on Mountaineer Band twirlers;

In 1997, the WVU band was awarded the Sudler Trophy by the John Philip Sousa Foundation.

=Fight song=
&quot;Hail, West Virginia&quot; is the university fight song.It was composed by WVU alumni Earl Miller and Ed McWhorter in 1915.The lyrics were written by Fred B. Deem, who later became a lawyer in Clarksburg, West Virginia. The Mountaineer Marching Band performs the second verse of &quot;Hail, West Virginia&quot; as part of its pre-game performance at Mountaineer football games.

=Carpet roll=

In 1955, Fred Schaus and Alex Mumford devised the idea of rolling out an elaborate gold and blue carpet for Mountaineer basketball players to use when taking the court for pre-game warm-ups. In addition, Mountaineer players warmed up with a special gold and blue basketball. The University continued this tradition until the late 1960s when it died out, but former Mountaineer player Gale Catlett reintroduced the carpet when he returned to West Virginia University in 1978 as head coach of the men's basketball team.

=2007 NIT Championship T-Shirts=
In 2007, after winning the NIT Championship, West Virginia players donned t-shirts that were misspelled to read &quot;West Virgina.&quot; The Mountaineers wore them anyway after their 78-73 victory over Clemson in the final. WVU sports information director Shelly Poe said the NIT printed the shirts.;[http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/topstories/news-article.aspx?storyid=79064 ''Associated Press'' (March 30, 2007): &quot;NIT Championship Shirts Have a Misspelling&quot;];
