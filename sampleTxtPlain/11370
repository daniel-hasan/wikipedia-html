The FIFA World Cup, sometimes called the Football World Cup or the Soccer World Cup, but usually referred to simply as the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the men's national football teams of the member nations of ''Fédération Internationale de Football Association'' (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.

The tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (often called the ''World Cup Finals''). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely-viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 FIFA World Cup#Final|2006 tournament final.;[http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/ffprojects/ip-401_06e_tv_2658.pdf 2006 FIFA World Cup TV Coverage], FIFA.com. Retrieved on June 6, 2007.;

In the eighteen tournaments held, only seven nations have won the title. Brazil is the most successful World Cup team, having won the tournament five times. The current World Champions, Italy, follows with four titles, while Germany holds three. The other former champions are Uruguay (who won the inaugural tournament) and Argentina with two titles each, and England and France with one title each.

The most recent World Cup Finals were held in Germany, where Italy was crowned champion after beating France in the final. The next World Cup Finals will be held in South Africa, from 11 June 2010 to 11 July 2010, and the 2014 Finals will be held in Brazil.

History


=Previous international competitions= 
The world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England,;[http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html England National Football Team Match No. 1], England Football Online. Retrieved on November 19, 2007.; with the first international tournament, the inaugural edition of the British Home Championship, taking place in 1884.;;At this stage the sport was rarely played outside Great Britain and Ireland. As football began to increase in popularity in other parts of the world at the turn of the century, it was held as a demonstration sport (with no medals awarded) at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics, and at the 1906 Intercalated Games; football became an official competition at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Planned by The Football Association (FA), the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the England national amateur football team) won the event in both 1908 and 1912.

After FIFA was founded in 1904, there was an attempt made by FIFA to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside of the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.;[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/historyfifa2.html History of FIFA - FIFA takes shape], FIFA.com. Retrieved on November 19, 2007.;

With the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, Sir Thomas Lipton organized the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy tournament in Turin in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as ''The First World Cup'',;[http://www.shrewsbury.gov.uk/Public/news/thomaslipton.htm 'The First World Cup'. The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy]. Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council. Retrieved on April 11, 2006.; and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but The Football Association of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited West Auckland Town F.C.|West Auckland, an amateur side from County Durham, to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title, and were given the trophy to keep forever, as per the rules of the competition. 

In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the Olympic tournament as a &quot;world football championship for amateurs&quot;, and took responsibility for managing the event.;[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/historyfifa3.html History of FIFA - More associations follow], FIFA.com.

Retrieved on June 10 2006.; Uruguay then won the Olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928. In 1928 FIFA made the decision to stage their own international tournament outside of the Olympics. With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions (as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era) and to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country.

The 1932 Summer Olympics, held in Los Angeles, did not plan to include football as part of the schedule due to the low popularity of football in the United States, as American football had been growing in popularity. FIFA and the IOC also disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the Games.;[http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,101801,00.html The Olympic Odyssey so far...

The national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition.;[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/historyfifa4.html History of FIFA - The first FIFA World Cup™], FIFA.com. Retrieved on November 19, 2007.; Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip. In total 13 nations took part — seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America. 

The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by France and the USA, who beat Mexico 4-1 and Belgium 3-0, respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by Lucien Laurent of France.;; In the final, Uruguay defeated Argentina 4-2 in front of a crowd of 93,000 people in Montevideo, and became the first nation to win a World Cup.;[http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_02e_fwc-origin_8816.pdf FIFA World Cup Origin], FIFA.com.

=Growth=
The issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the 1934 and 1938 tournaments, with Brazil the only South American team to compete in both. The 1942 and 1946 competitions were cancelled due to World War II and its aftermath.

The 1950 World Cup was the first to include British participants. British teams withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against a foreign influence on football,;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0001/index.shtml Scotland and the 1950 World Cup], BBC. Retrieved on May 13 2006.; but rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation.;; The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions Uruguay, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again in one of the most famous matches in World Cup history, which was later called the &quot;Maracanazo&quot;.

In the tournaments between 1934 and 1978, 16 teams competed for each finals tournament, except in 1938, when Austria were absorbed into Germany after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when India, Scotland and Turkey withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams.;Glanville, p45; Most of the participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia and Oceania. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: United States, semi-finalists in 1930; Cuba, quarter-finalists in 1938; North Korea, quarter-finalists in 1966; and Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1970.

The finals were expanded to 24 teams in 1982,;Glanville, p238; then to 32 in 1998,;Glanville, p359; allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. The one exception is Oceania, who have never had a guaranteed spot in the finals. In recent years, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, and those who have reached the quarter-finals include: Mexico, quarterfinalists in 1986; Cameroon, quarter-finalists in 1990; Korea Republic, finishing in fourth place in 2002; and Senegal and the United States, both quarter-finalists in 2002. However, European and South American teams have remained the stronger forces. For example, the quarter-finalists in 2006 were all from Europe or South America.

198 nations attempted to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and a record 204 will attempt to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.;[http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/organisation/media/newsid=122766.html#record+number+teams+enter+preliminary+competition Record number of 204 teams enter preliminary competition], FIFA.com.

Unlike many other sports (and even women's football), the men's football tournament at the Olympics is not a top-level tournament since the creation of the FIFA World Cup. It is currently an under-23 tournament with each team allowed three overage players.;[http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/regulations_olympics_beijing_2008_en_6198.pdf Regulations Men's Olympic Football Tournament 2008], FIFA.com.

Trophy

From 1930 to 1970, the ''FIFA World Cup Trophy#Jules Rimet Trophy|Jules Rimet Trophy'' was awarded to the World Cup winner. It was originally simply known as the ''World Cup'' or ''Coupe du Monde'', but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983, and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.;[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/worldcup/julesrimettrophy.html Jules Rimet Trophy], FIFA.com. Retrieved on November 19, 2007.;

After 1970, a new trophy, known as the ''FIFA World Cup Trophy#FIFA World Cup Trophy|FIFA World Cup Trophy'', was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven different countries, evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer Silvio Gazzaniga. The new trophy ishigh, made of solid 18 carat(75%) gold and weighs . The base contains two layers of semi-precious malachite while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since 1974. The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: &quot;The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory.&quot;;[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/worldcup/trophies.html FIFA World Cup Trophy], FIFA.com. Retrieved on November 19, 2007.;

This new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently, irrespective of how many World Cups they win. World Cup winners retain the trophy until the next tournament and are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original.;[http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/marketingtv/marketing/fifaassets/trophy.html FIFA Assets – Trophy], FIFA.com. Retrieved on November 19, 2007.; Argentina, Germany (as West Germany), Italy and Brazil have all won the second trophy twice, while France has won it once.

Format
=Qualification=

Since the second World Cup in 1934, qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament.;; They are held within the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, Europe), overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams, but also subject to lobbying from the confederations. 
 
The qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental play-offs. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone will enter a play-off for a spot in the 2010 World Cup.;; From the 1938 World Cup onwards,;; host nations have received an automatic berth in the finals. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the 2006 FIFA World Cup onward, requiring the champions to qualify. Brazil, winners in 2002, thus became the first defending champions to play in a qualifying match.

=Final tournament=
The current finals tournament features 32 national teams competing over a month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: a ''group stage'' followed by a ''knockout stage''.

In the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeded (including the hosts, with the other teams selected using a formula based on both the FIFA World Rankings and performances in recent World Cups) and drawn to separate groups. The other teams are assigned to different &quot;pots&quot;, usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since 1998, constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.;;

Each group plays a round-robin tournament, guaranteeing that every team will play at least three matches. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among the teams.The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage.Points are used to rank the teams within a group.Since 1994, three points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss (prior to this, winners received two points rather than three).If two or more teams end up with the same number of points, tiebreakers are used: first is goal difference, then total goals scored, then head-to-head results, and finally drawing of lots (i.e. determining team positions at random).;[http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/fifa%5fwc%5fsouth%5fafrica%5f2010%5fregulations%5fen%5f14123.pdf Regulations of the 2010 FIFA World Cup] (page 40–41), FIFA.com. Retrieved on November 19, 2007.;

The knockout stage is a single-elimination tournament in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the &quot;round of 16&quot; (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.; (pdf);

Below are the various formats used in previous tournaments:;
*1930: A group stage, followed by a knockout stage with 4 teams (group winners; note that no third-place match was played)
*1934–1938: Single-elimination tournament; these are the only tournaments without a group stage
*1950: A first group stage, followed by a final group stage with 4 teams (group winners); this is the only tournament without an official final match
*1954–1970: A group stage, followed by a knockout stage with 8 teams (group winners and runners-up)
*1974–1978: A first group stage, followed by a second group stage with 8 teams (first round group winners and runners-up), followed by the final (second round group winners; second round group runners-up played in the third-place match)
*1982: A first group stage, followed by a second group stage with 12 teams (first round group winners and runners-up), followed by a knockout stage with 4 teams (second round group winners)
*1986–1994: A group stage, followed by a knockout stage with 16 teams (group winners, runners-up and the four best third-placed teams)
*1998–present: A group stage, followed by a knockout stage with 16 teams (group winners and runners-up)

Selection of hosts

;
Early World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The choice of location gave rise to controversies, a consequence of the three-week boat journey between South America and Europe, the two centres of strength in football. The decision to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing.;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632201.stm History of 1930 World Cup], BBC. Retrieved on May 13, 2006.; The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these, the 1938 FIFA World Cup, in France was controversial, as the American countries had been led to understand that the World Cup would rotate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the tournament.;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632206.stm History of 1938 World Cup], BBC. Retrieved on May 13, 2006.; 

After the 1958 FIFA World Cup, to avoid future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the Americas and Europe, which continued until the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The 2002 FIFA World Cup, hosted jointly by Korea Republic and Japan, was the first one held in Asia, and the only tournament with multiple hosts.;; In 2010, South Africa will become the first African nation to host the World Cup. The 2014 FIFA World Cup will be hosted by Brazil, the first held in South America since 1978,;; and will be the first occasion where consecutive World Cups are held outside Europe.

The host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Executive Committee. This is done under a single transferable vote system. The national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a &quot;Hosting Agreement&quot; from FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the Cup is currently made six or seven years in advance of the tournament.

For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the final tournament is rotated between confederations, allowing only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid to host the tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the FIFA World Cup hosts#2006 FIFA World Cup|controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018.;; This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.

Media coverage
The World Cup was first televised in 1954 and is now the most widely-viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games. The cumulative audience of the 2006 World Cup -including all of the matches - is estimated to be 26.29 billion.; 715.1 million individuals watched the final match of this tournament (a ninth of the entire population of the planet).

In all, 78 nations have appeared at least once in the World Cup Finals. Of these, only eleven have made it to the final match, and only seven have won. The seven national teams that have won the World Cup have added stars to the crest, located on their shirt, with each star representing a World Cup victory.

With five titles, Brazil is the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup#Ranking of teams by number of appearances|participated in every World Cup Finals to date.;; Italy follows with four titles, including the most recent one in 2006. Brazil and Italy are also the only nations to have won consecutive titles, each winning their first two titles back-to-back (Italy: 1934 and 1938; Brazil: 1958 and 1962). In 1970 and 1994, Brazil and Italy were finalists, each having a chance to become the first team to win a third title (and allowing them to keep the Jules Rimet trophy permanently) and a fourth title respectively. Brazil won both matches, and added a record fifth title in 2002. They have won the World Cup in the four continents that the World Cup has been hosted at (Europe: 1958; South America: 1962; North America: 1970 &amp; 1994; Asia: 2002). The only other team to win a World Cup outside its own continental zone is Argentina (1986 in North America).

Italy, Brazil, West Germany, Argentina, as well as non-champions Netherlands, are the only teams to have ever appeared in consecutive finals, while Brazil and West Germany are the only two teams ever to appear in three consecutive World Cup final matches (1994, 1998, 2002 and 1982, 1986, 1990, respectively). Brazil won two out of the three (1994, 2002) and West Germany won only one (1990). Of the eighteen World Cup final matches, only twice have the same two teams contested the match. Brazil and Italy played in 1970 and 1994, and West Germany and Argentina in 1986 and 1990 (West Germany and Argentina also became the only two teams to meet in consecutive finals). Every final match has also featured at least one out of Brazil, Italy, (West) Germany, and Argentina, the four teams with the most appearances in the final match.

Below is a list of the 11 teams that have played in a World Cup final. Brazil and Germany each finished as either winners or runners-up seven times.

=Performances by host nations=
Six of the seven champions have won one of their titles while playing in their own homeland, the exception being Brazil, who lost the deciding match (known as Maracanazo) when they hosted the 1950 tournament.

England (1966) and France (1998) won their only titles while playing as host nations. Uruguay (1930), Italy (1934) and Argentina (1978) won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again, while Germany (1974) won their second cup title on home soil.

Other nations have also been successful when hosting the tournament. Sweden (runners-up in 1958), Chile (third place in 1962), South Korea (fourth place in 2002), Mexico (quarterfinals in 1970 and 1986) and Japan (second round in 2002) all have their best results when serving as hosts. All host nations have progressed beyond the first round.

=Best performances by continental zones=


To date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by European and South American teams. The two continents have won nine titles apiece. Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: the USA (in 1930) and South Korea (in 2002). African teams have twice reached the quarter-finals: Cameroon in 1990 and Senegal in 2002, but have never progressed. Oceania have only been represented in the World Cup three times, and an Oceanian team has reached the second round on only one occasion, when Australia progressed beyond the group stage in 2006.

All World Cups won by European teams have taken place in Europe. The only non-European team to win in Europe is Brazil in 1958. Only twice had consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same continent - when Italy and Brazil successfully defended their titles in 1938 and 1962 respectively.
