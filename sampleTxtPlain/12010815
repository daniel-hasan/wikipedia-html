The military history of Gibraltar during World War II exemplifies Gibraltar's position as a British fortress since the early 18th century and as a vital factor in British military strategy, both as a foothold on the continent of Europe, and as a bastion of British sea power.;''The Rock'' by Warren Tute, publ. by ''Companion Book Club'',. 1958; During World War II, Gibraltar served a vital role in the Mediterranean Theatre, controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the Mediterranean Sea from the west.;William G.F. Jackson, The Rock of the Gibraltarians. A History of Gibraltar, Grendon : Gibraltar Books (1987) 1998;

In addition to its commanding position, Gibraltar provided a strongly-defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Force H, under the command of Vice-Admiral James Somerville was based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the besieged island of Malta.;; During the course of the war, Gibraltar came under aerial bombardment from Vichy French aircraft and Italian aircraft based on Sardinia. Additionally, the island fortress was the focus of underwater attacks by the Italian commando frogman unit ''Decima Flottiglia MAS'' and their human torpedoes, which were based on the interned Italian ship ''SS Olterra'' in the nearby Spanish harbour of Algeciras.;

Inside the Rock of Gibraltar itself, miles of tunnels were excavated from the limestone. Masses of rock were blasted out to build an &quot;underground city&quot;.;; In huge man-made caverns, barracks, offices, and a fully equipped hospital were constructed, complete with an operating theatre and X-Ray|x-ray equipment.;

Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942, was coordinated from the &quot;Rock&quot;.;; General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was given command of the operation, set up his headquarters in Gibraltar during the planning phases of the operation.; Following the successful completion of the North African campaign and the surrender of Italy in 1943, Gibraltar's role shifted from a forward operating base to a rear-area supply position. The harbour continued to operate dry docks and supply depots for the convoy routes through the Mediterranian until V-E Day in 1945. 

Prelude
Governor of Gibraltar Noel Mason-Macfarlane|Mason MacFarlane with Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Gibraltar. (Imperial War Museum)
World War II dramatically changed the lives of Gibraltarians.; The decision to enforce mass evacuation in order to increase the strength of the Rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most Gibraltarians (some for up to ten years) had nowhere to call 'home'.; Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being 'British' by sharing in the war effort.;Bond, pp. 97;

In June 1940 about 13,500 evacuees were shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco, but following the capitulation of the French to the German armies in June 1940, the new Pro-German French Vichy Government found the presence of Gibraltarian evacuees in Casablanca an embarrassment and sought opportunities for their removal.; The opportunity soon arose when 15 British cargo vessels arrived under Commodore Crichton repatriating 15,000 French servicemen who had been rescued from Dunkirk.; Once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked, the ships were interned until they agreed to take away all the evacuees.; Although Crichton was unable to obtain permission to clean and restock his ships (and contrary to British Admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees) when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards, he opened up his gangways for boarding.; However, when they arrived at Gibraltar, the Governor would not allow them to land fearing that once the evacuees were back on the Rock, it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time.;Bond, pp. 98;Crowds gathered in John Macintosh square in the centre of Gibraltar as the news broke, speeches were made and two Local government in the United Kingdom#Councils and councillors|City Councillors accompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor (Sir Clive Liddel) to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land.; After receiving instructions from London, a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived to take them away from the Rock, and by 13 July the re-evacuation back to Gibraltar had been completed.; 

British conservative politician Oliver Stanley agreed to accept the evacuees in the United Kingdom, but he argued with Gibraltar over the number of people involved.; The Governor, he declared, had given the number of evacuees first as 13,000, then as 14,000 and finally as 16,000.;Garcia, pp. 15; He asked for the situation to be clarified, stressing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13,000 could be accepted, 2000 of whom were to be sent to the Portuguese Atlantic island of Madeira.; The situation, replied General Liddel on 19 July, ‘is that this is a fortress liable to heave and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are 22,000.; The 13,000 was the number sent to Morocco, and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered.’; In London the evacuees were placed in the hands of the Ministry of Health, and many were housed in Kensington area.; Concern for them in Gibraltar mounted as the air raids against London intensified, coupled with the arrival of harrowing letters, describing the circumstances in which the evacuees were living.;GGA, Evacuation 1940: General Mechanics of ;

In September rumours were already circulating among the evacuees, and in Gibraltar, that the possibility of re-evacuating the Gibraltarians once more was being mooted, this time the destination being Jamaica, in the West Indies.;Garcia, pp. 16; After much contention, it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island, and 1,093 evacuees left for Jamaica direct, on 9 October, with more following later on.;Garcia, pp. 16; However petitions followed and the demands were met, partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping.;Garcia, pp. 16; The situation at the end of 1940, therefore, was that approximately 2,000 evacuees were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira, with the bulk of around 10,000 housed in the London area.;Garcia, pp. 16-17;

Royal Air Force involvement: 1939 - 1941
Construction of a solid surface runway began in late 1939 and in 1940 it was proposed to extend the existing runway to a length of 1550 yards (1417 m).; The land reclamation commenced towards the end of 1941 along with the construction of an RAF camp at the &quot;North Front&quot;, now RAF Gibraltar.; The RAF dispatched their next squadron to Gibraltar at this time and it was in September 1939 that war with Germany was declared and the strong possibility of U-boat|German submarines concentrating in the Strait of Gibraltar and using Spanish port facilities, loomed large in Admiralty thinking.; So at 09:00 (UTC) on the 9 September 1939, No. 200 Squadron RAF was ordered to Gibraltar, loaded to the gunwales with equipment.;

On 25 September 1939,''No 200 (Coastal) Group'' was formed as a subordinate formation to HQ RAF Mediterranean in control of No 202 Sqn.; The Group's function was the control of Royal Air Force units operating from Gibraltar.;In late 1940 the Group was transferred to Coastal Command.;;Later a combined HQ was formed which commenced operations in early 1942.;;

Operation Felix and Xª MAS: 1940 - 1943

For the aerial attack on the harbour of Gibraltar forces are to be designated which will guarantee abundant success. For the subsequent operations against naval objectives and for support of the attack of the Rock mainly dive bombers units are to be transferred to Spain. Sufficient anti-aircraft artillery is to be allocated to the army units including its use against ground targets.;;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; | ''Operation Felix, Directive No. 18,'' Section IV: Luftwaffe’’ by Adolf Hitler
|}

The Rock came through the war relatively unscathed but, given its strategic importance, Germany made plans to capture Gibraltar.;Bond pp. 100-102; Codenamed &quot;Felix&quot;, the plan which was signed by Adolf Hitler himself was formulated at the highest level of command.; With or without permission, Germany would take entry through Spain and attack Gibraltar driving the British out of the Western Mediterranean.; The Strait would be effectively closed to the Allies once Gibraltar was in German hands, forcing Mediterranean-bound Allied shipping to steam all the way around Africa and enter the sea through the Suez Canal.; The Rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving France but landing afterwards at Spanish air bases.; To deny a possible Spanish capture of the base, the German planners decided that the final attack to seize Gibraltar was to be made by German troops alone.; 

=German plans=
Diplomatic failure at the highest levels of government prevented the operation from occurring at the beginning of 1941 which had been drawn up in detail by the Wehrmacht in the summer and autumn of 1940.;;

General Ludwig Kübler's XLIX Corps would conduct the actual attack on the Rock.; The assault forces would comprise the Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland, the 98th Regiment of the 1st Mountain Division, 26 medium and heavy artillery battalions, three observation battalions, three engineer battalions, two smoke battalions, a detachment of 150 Brandenburgers, and up to 150 radio-controlled midget tanks (&quot;Goliaths&quot;) packed with high explosives.; 

As part of a combined-force operation, the Luftwaffe would contribute Ju 88As, Stukas, Messerschmitts, three light AA battalions, and three heavy AA battalions.;; The Kriegsmarine would cooperate by using U-boats to interfere with British naval movement and emplacing coastal batteries to further discourage the Royal Navy.;;

=Cancellation=
If they were allowed free passage through Spain for their ground troops and air forces, German planners were confident an assault in January 1941 would yield victory.; However, Franco's consent was not forthcoming and the operation was postponed, modified, and ultimately abandoned.;;

With Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the Soviet Union) looming and units being transferred to the east in preparation,; by 10 March 1941 Felix had been amended to become ''Operation Felix-Heinrich'', whereby German troops would be withdrawn from the USSR to capture Gibraltar when the approximate line Kiev-Smolensk-Opotschka was reached.; Because the campaign in the Soviet Union did not succeed as planned and Franco's intransigence continued, even this amended version of the operation was not implemented.;

=Decima Flottiglia MAS=
Known as the &quot;Floating Trojan Horse of Gibraltar&quot;,;; ''Decima Flottiglia MAS'', an Italian commando frogman unit created during the Fascist government engaged in numerous attacks against the harbor at Gibraltar. 

Gibraltar was a very tempting target for the Italians, who saw it as a refuge for British warships and allied merchant shipping.; The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa located two miles from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named Conchita Ramognino.;

Operation Tracer: 1941 - 1942
Image:Illustrazione del Popolo (1942).JPG|thumb|200px|right|Italian newsmagazine ''Illustrazione del Popolo'' front cover depicting the Italian bombardment of Gibraltar. Dated 8 November 1942.
A document came to light in the top secret files of the offices of British naval intelligence giving details of the plan, codenamed ''Operation Tracer'', which was hatched during the darkest days of the Second World War.;; Six men were to be sealed in a cave with only two small openings to the outside world and left with enough supplies for one year. They were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be embalmed and cemented into the walls. Only if Germany was defeated within a year would they be released.; 

The volunteers – two doctors, three signalmen and their leader – would run an observation post from the two 12 inch by 6 inch slits, one looking due east out over the Mediterranean and the other west over the Strait of Gibraltar and the harbour and wireless back all shipping movements to the British Admiralty.; The potential menace of Germany’s invasion was seen as a potential threat and by late 1941, ideas for a series of secret observation posts (first in Gibraltar and later in other places like Malta and Aden) were put together as Operation Tracer.; 

Work in Gibraltar began immediately under Commander Geoffry Birley and his chief engineer Colonel Fordham. The site chosen at Lord Airey’s Battery on the southern tip of the Rock already had an existing tunnelling scheme for a shelter.; 
Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of MI6 radio expert Colonel Gambier-Parry. Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task.; A member of Scott’s ill-fated expedition to the Antarctic, Murray Levick was called up as Surgeon-Commander to advise on survival techniques.; There were practical matters such as diet, exercise, sanitation and clothing to consider as well as vital ‘psychology of the personnel’.; The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation.; A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars. However, Operation Tracer was never needed, as Adolf Hitler turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the Eastern Front.; 

The operation had been clouded in mystery until the discovery of papers at the Public Records Office in Kew UK.; Previously in the 1960s, details of the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as ‘Operation Monkey,’ yet facts were very sparse.; 

In 1997 'Stay Behind Cave' (as it was nicknamed) was discovered in Gibraltar by the ''Gibraltar Caving Group'',;; but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission.; The discovery came about when the group encountered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel. Further searching led them to break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over 50 years.;; 

In November 2006 Jim Crone and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson, senior tunnel guide with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, met possibly the only member of Operation Tracer still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home in England.; Cooper, 92 at the time, provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a Surgeon-Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR).; He recalled stories about his colleagues, his training, and his feelings about the task.;;

North African Campaign: 1942

The Strait of Gibraltar

Plans for the Allied counter offensive after the attack on Pearl Harbor were ongoing by mid-1942.; An invasion of Europe in 1943 would be unworkable, but the allies could attack the &quot;soft underbelly of Europe&quot; through the Mediterranean, as Prime Minister Winston Churchill put it.; Devised by Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt and Churchill and code named Operation Torch, the plan was to occupy French North Africa wherefrom attacks could be sent off to drive Italy out of the war.;; 

In July 1942 Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed Allied Commander-in-Chief of Operation Torch.; Churchill placed Gibraltar under the command of General Eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this, the first large-scale Anglo-American operation of the war.; He arrived in Gibraltar on 5 November 1942 to take over, not just command of Operation Torch itself, but also military command of Gibraltar.;

General Eisenhower stayed at ''The Convent'', the official Governor's residence, but his operational headquarters were in a small chamber in a tunnel in the heart of the Rock.; In his memoirs General Eisenhower wrote: 



One hundred thousand soldiers on the high seas in a multitude of transports converged on Gibraltar.; More than 400 aircraft of all types were crammed into the dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway.; Fighters had been shipped in crates and assembled on the airfield.; Every available area of storage was taken up with ammunition, fuel, and other essential supplies. 168 American pilots were housed in the RAF messes at ''North Front''.;

On 8 November 1942, 466 aircraft from Gibraltar landed on captured North African airfields.

From their headquarters in Gibraltar, General Eisenhower and Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham directed Operation Torch, the first major combined combat operation during World War II involving American and British forces.;

=War tunnels=
Given that Gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it, the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the Rock of Gibraltar.; This &quot;town&quot; inside the Rock contained its own power station, water supply, and hospital.;; Some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end. The Royal Engineers along with a Canadian contingent added someof such tunnels.;

Death of Władysław Sikorski: 1943
Sikorski's Liberator, on its back with its wheels just having started to retract, in the sea just off Gibraltar following the crash (1943).
On July 4, 1943, a B-24 Liberator|Liberator bomber from RAF Transport Command took off from Gibraltar for England.; On board was General Władysław Sikorski, Prime Minister of Poland's London-based government in exile and Commander-in-Chief of its armed forces, returning from visiting Polish troops in the Middle East.; 

The aircraft climbed normally from the runway, levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour.; The 62-year-old general died, along with 15 others.; The sole survivor was the Czech-born pilot, Max Prchal, who was rescued by an RAF launch.; The bodies of five passengers and crew, including Sikorski's daughter, were never found.;;

The coffins General Sikorski and his Chief of Staff, General Kilimecki, draped in the Polish National Flag lay in state in the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned.;; After a Requiem Mass, the bodies were carried in procession to the H.M. Dockyard with full Military Honours to be shipped to London in anticipation that General Sikorski’s remains would one day be returned to a liberated Poland.; The route to the dockyard was lined by British Troops and the coffins carried and escorted by Polish Servicemen.;

=Investigation=
In 1943 a British Court of Inquiry investigated the crash of Sikorski's B-24 Liberator|Liberator II ''AL523'', but was unable to determine the probable cause, finding only that it was an accident;Stanczyk, Zbigniew L., [http://www.dziennik.com/www/dziennik/kult/archiwum/07-12-02/pp-09-13-02.html &quot;Tajemnica gen. Sikorskiego&quot;], ''Przegląd Polski Online&quot;, 7 December 2002, in Polish, retrieved July 31, 2007; and the &quot;aircraft became uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established&quot;. A popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to jamming aircraft controls.; Various authors. [http://www.udskior.gov.pl/kombatant/200306_spec.pdf Biuletyn „Kombatant” nr specjalny (148) czerwiec 2003] Special Edition of Kombatant Bulletin No.148 6/2003 on the occasion of the Year of General Sikorski. Official publication of the Polish government Agency of Combatants and Repressed; Despite this finding, the political context of the event, coupled with a variety of curious circumstances, immediately gave rise to speculation that Sikorski's death had been no accident, and may in fact have been the direct result of a Soviet, British or even Polish conspiracy.;;

Six weeks before the crash, while Sikorski had been at Gibraltar for the first time, en route to his Middle East inspection, a Polish government office in London received a phone call stating that Sikorski had been killed in a crash at Gibraltar; the call had been discounted as a prank, but has since led to speculation. It is often mentioned that two of Sikorski's previous planes had been subject to incidents. The November 30, 1942, forced landing at Montreal, Canada, was suspected to have been caused by sabotage. Another incident might have taken place few months earlier, in March.; At Gibraltar, due to the special treatment accorded VIPs, there was uncertainty about who had in fact boarded the plane and about the exact cargo manifest &amp;mdash; all leading to uncertainty as to the identity of the bodies recovered from the crash site; some bodies, including that of Sikorski's daughter, Zofia, have never been recovered.; [http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=71300 Baliszewski, Dawid, &quot;Bransoletka Zofii&quot; (&quot;Zofia's Bracelet&quot;), ''Tygodnik Wprost'', no. 1152 (December 31, 2004)], retrieved July 31, 2007.;

The surrender of Italy in September 1943 lifted any possible objections to the return of the evacuees to the Rock.; As a result a Resettlement Board was established in November, and at a meeting of the Board on 8 February 1944 repatriation priorities were finally agreed.;Garcia, pp. 20; On 6 April 1944 the first group of 1367 repatriates arrived on the Rock directly from the United Kingdom and on 28 May, the first repatriation party left Madeira, and by the end of 1944 only 520 non-priority evacuees remained on the island.;Garcia, pp. 20;

In London, home-comers were making claims on the evacuees’ wartime accommodation and 500 Gibraltarians were re-evacuated to Scotland and 3,000 to camps in Northern Ireland.;Bond, pp. 100; Although the Governor, Lt. General Sir Noel Mason-MacFarlane, fought valiantly on behalf of the evacuees and did not accept the lack of accommodation as a sufficient reason for the delays.; As late as 1947 there were still 2,000 in Irish camps.; The last of the evacuees did not see the Rock again until 1951.;
