1988 Jaguar XJ-S
1985 XJ-S 5.3 V-12 HE, North American quad headlights

The Jaguar XJ-S (later the Jaguar XJS) was a luxury grand tourer produced by the British manufacturer Jaguar. The XJ-S replaced the legendary Jaguar E-type|E-Type (or XK-E) in September 1975, and was based on the XJ saloon. It had been developed as the XK-F, though it was very different in character from its predecessor. Although it never had quite the same sporting image, the XJ-S was a competent grand tourer, and more aerodynamic than the E-Type. The last XJS was produced on April 4, 1996, with the XK8 taking its place.

1976
The first XJ-S appeared in 1975 as a 1976 model.Power came from the Jaguar V-12 petrol engine with a choice of a manual or automatic transmission, but the manual was soon dropped. V-12 automobiles were unusual at the time, with notable others coming from Italian luxury sports car makers Lamborghini and Ferrari. The specifications of the XJ-S compared well with both Italian cars; it was able to accelerate to 60 mph (100 km/h) in 6.5 seconds and reach 157 mph (255 km/h). 

For 1977, the &quot;Group44&quot; racing team had a very successful season in Trans-Am Series|Trans Am with a race car based on the actual production XJ-S chassis and running gear. The team won the series' 1977 drivers' championship cup for Bob Tullius but missed winning the manufacturer's title by 2 points (only one Jaguar was competing in the Trans-AM series compared to many more Porsche entrants).In 1978, a purpose-built tube-frame &quot;silhouette&quot; style XJS race car was constructed which greatly reduced the weight compared to the full production chassis car campaigned in 1977. This silhouette car had only the production car's roof panel as the sole piece of factory XJS sheetmetal on the car. Group 44 succeeded in again capturing the driver's championship for Bob Tullias and also captured the manufacturer's title as well, by entering Brian Fuerstenau driving the 1977 car at some venues to gain additional manufacturer's point for Jaguar. The silhouette car survived and has surfaced recently in the SVRA historic sports race series. The 1977 factory chassis race car is believed to still be in the hands of Group 44's Bob Tullius.

Jaguar's timing was not good; the car was launched in the wake of a fuel crisis, and the market for a 5.3-litre V-12 grand tourer was very small. The styling was also the subject of criticism, including the &quot;flying buttresses&quot; behind the windows.

Jaguar did seize promotional opportunities with the television series ''The New Avengers'' and ''Return of the Saint''. ''The New Avengers'' featured Mike Gambit (Gareth Hunt) who drove an XJ-S. Reliability issues meant that three XJ-S cars were used. ''Return of the Saint'' saw Simon Templar (played by Ian Ogilvy) driving an early XJ-S with the number plate &quot;ST 1&quot;. Miniature versions were made by Corgi and proved popular. A decade and a half before, Jaguar had turned down the producers of the earlier ''Saint'' series when approached about the E-type; the producers had instead used a Volvo P1800.

Responding to criticisms that the XJ-S was not a worthy E-type successor, Pininfarina revealed a sporty show car in 1979 based on XJ-S mechanicals. The car never went into production.

The 1980s
The 1981 XJ-S received the new Jaguar V12 engine#5.3 HE|High-Efficiency engine for much better economy.The XJ-S was also now the fastest automatic-transmission car in the world at 168 mph with 255kw and 0 to 60 in 5.7 seconds. In 1982, the new V12 XJ-S won first and second at the RAC Tourist Trophy race at Silverstone. 

In 1983 a new cabriolet version débuted with a new 3.6-litre Jaguar AJ6 engine, the XJ-SC. In the XJ-SC, the rear jump seats were eliminated making it only a 2-seat car. The XJ-SC was not a full convertible but had a non-removable center targa-type structure and fixed cant rails above the doors. The rear quarter windows remained as well. With the introduction of the AJ6 engine in the XJS chassis came the availability of a 5-speed manual transmission for the 6 cylinder cars. This model with a GETRAG manual transmission was not imported by Jaguar into the United states until 1994 (and then only in extremely limited numbers). A limited number of earlier 5-speed AJ6 cars did enter the US as grey market personal imports however. A V12 XJ-SC did not emerge until 1985. The two-seat XJ-SC targa-type model was replaced with a two-seat full convertible in 1988. Prior to that there was a special full convertible version called a Hess &amp; Eisenhardt XJS offered through dealers starting in 1986. The Hess &amp; Eisenhardt coachbuilding firm was located in Ohio and built approximately 2100 of these cars under contract from Jaguar before the official Jaguar built XJS convertible appeared in 1988 to be offered as a 1989 model. The Hess &amp; Eisenhardt convertible differed from the later Jaguar convertible XJS as its unpadded top folded down deeper into the body structure of the car resulting in a cleaner rear profile when the roof was lowered. The later Jaguar full convertible had a heavier padded top that did not fold into as small of a bundle when in the lowered position.

In 1984 Tom Walkinshaw’s TWR team captured the Group A title in the European Touring Car Championship with their version of a racing Jaguar XJS. In 1985, XJS drivers John Goss and Armin Hahne won the James Hardie Bathurst 1000 motor race in Australia.

In 1988 and 1989, a special XJR-S version of the V12 5.3 litre car was produced by TWR to celebrate Jaguar's win at Le Mans. A numbered limited edition of 100 of these cars were made for European sale only. This car had a distinctive TWR-fitted body kit, special alloy wheels and suspension and handling improvements. Between 1988 and 1989 a total of 350 XJR-s cars were produced with the 5.3-litre engine. After September 1989 the change was made to a special 6.0-litre engine with a Zytec engine management system. This was different from the standard 6.0-litre engine used in the late XJS models

Jaguar did consider a luxury Daimler version, without the flying buttresses, but this vehicle was not put into production.

Throughout the life of the XJS, British company [http://www.lynxmotors.co.uk/ Lynx] sold a high-quality four-seat full convertible conversion. Lynx also produced 67 hand-built two-door estate/shooting brake/station wagon versions of the XJS marketed under the &quot;Lynx Eventer&quot;. [http://www.austin-rover.co.uk/index.htm?lynxeventf.htm] The Eventer was a very elegant model, which succeeded in the overall design because it removed the flying butresses, incorporating them into the estate design.Jaguar were urged to market their own version but never did. Most Eventers are believed to still exist although build quality, especially on the early versions, was at best variable.

1991–96
The car was re-engineered in 1991 and renamed XJS, with a convertible waiting one year. The rear windows were enlarged, though the flying buttresses stayed, as designer Geoff Lawson argued that they were part of the car's character. The car got a new 4-litre version of the Jaguar AJ6 engine#4.0|AJ6, and the V12 was upped to 6 litres in 1993. At the same time the car benefited from a revision to the rear brakes, they were now fitted with outboard rear disc brakes, instead of the more complicated inboard items on previous models. These changes begin the &quot;face-lift&quot; for the aging XJS.A 2+2 (car body style)|2+2 convertible was also introduced, as was a customized ''insignia'' line.In 1994 the car received more aerodynamic front and rear bumper fascias, which completed the face-lift. 1994 was the only year the 5 speed manual transmission XJS was exported to the United States. Exact production figures are unknown, though it is likely there are fewer than 10. In 1995 substantial revisions were made to the 4-litre AJ6 engine. 
The car was discontinued in 1996, after 21 years in production. It was replaced by the XK8.

Today
Having been in production for over 20 years, the XJS today can vary in price from a few thousand pounds for an older coupe, to over twenty thousand for a late V-12 Convertible. The sweet spot of the market is often considered by enthusiasts to be the mid-80's coupes.While initial build quality is likely no longer a factor, these cars were greatly improved over the earlier models but are not nearly as expensive as the later cars. Over time, the XJS has slowly moved from &quot;used car&quot; status to collectable. More often than not however, these vehicles are in the hands of non-enthusiasts.Most cars on the market suffer not from mileage, but from age.Everything made of rubber is likely to have disintegrated with time if it has not already been replaced.This includes perhaps hundreds of small hoses, bushings, and seals. If these inexpensive, but time consuming to replace, parts are renewed the balance of the car is fairly indestructible.

BBC Top Gear

The XJ-S has been featured on BBC's ''Top Gear'' television series several times:
*Richard Hammond used a 1985 XJ-S Jaguar V12 engine#5.3 HE|HE as a test car to see the advantages of weight reduction by stripping the car of all of its amenities. With The Stig behind the wheel, the stock car had a 0-60mph time of 8.6 seconds. After stripping out 223kg (491.6lb) of weight (to Jason Dawe's dismay), the Jaguar the time was only 7.4 seconds.The 0-100mph time was also improved by five seconds. (List of Top Gear episodes#Series 1|Series 1 Episode 9, 22 December 2002) 
*In the next series the stripped down '85 Jaguar (described as &quot;old, rusty and basically worthless&quot;) was pitted against various (significantly younger) exotic cars in standing quarter mile to see '...which country builds the world's best supercar'. In a drag race against the German Porsche 911#996 Turbo .282000.E2.80.932004.29|Porsche 911 Turbo, the Japanese Honda NSX#&quot;Facelifted&quot; NSX (Worldwide)|Honda NSX, the American Chevrolet Corvette, the French Venturi Atlantique, and the Italian Ferrari 360 the Jaguar fared poorly, coming in last and very far behind all the other cars with a time of eighteen and a half seconds. Hammond then decided to 'cheat' and had installed a NOS nitrous system on the car that added 200hp estimated to total 500hp. The race was then rerun and the Jaguar XJ-S then did the quarter mile in only thirteen seconds, beating all the other cars, with the Porsche coming second and the Ferrari third. (List of Top Gear episodes#Series 2|Series 2 Episode 3, 25 May 2003) 
*The original (black-suited) Stig was &quot;killed&quot; when he went 109mph in the modified XJ-S on the HMS ''Invincible'', flying off the deck. All that was found of him was his glove. (List of Top Gear episodes#Series 3|Series 3 Episode 1, 26 October 2003)
*James May tested a XJ-S that had been modernized by [http://www.kwengineering.org/ Knowles-Wilkins Engineering] to correct many of the original's flaws and was very impressed. (List of Top Gear episodes#Series 4|Series 4 Episode 6, 13 June 2004)May later used a Knowles-Wilkins XJ-S convertible to successfully traverse much of France in another television programme, ''Oz and James's Big Wine Adventure''. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/main.jhtml?xml=/motoring/2006/08/12/mrmay12.xml]
*For a Cheap Car Challenge, the &quot;£1500 coupé that isn't a Porsche challenge&quot;, James May purchased an XJ-S HE. He spent £1100 buying it, and it proved to be the least reliable car out of a group of three cars, the others being a Mitsubishi Starion EX and a BMW 635CSi. Despite this it managed to outlast the rival cars to ultimately win the challenge. However, May offered the title to Clarkson if he admitted that he wrecked his Starion due to Clarkson fitting an oversized turbocharger for the final endurance race that overwhelmed the cooling system. (List of Top Gear episodes#Series 6|Series 6 Episode 2, 29 May 2005)
