''Acer × zoeschense'' (Zoeschen Maple) is a hybrid maple, a cross between ''Acer campestre'' (Field Maple), and either ''Acer lobelii'' (Lobel's Maple);Mitchell, A. F. (1974).

''Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia''.; While Field Maple parentage is universally accepted, the second parent is uncertain, though the tree's extensive production of root sprouts favours ''A. cappadocicum'' over ''A. lobelii''.; It takes its name from Zöschen Nurseries in Germany, where it first appeared as a garden hybrid (as opposed to a hybrid occurring in nature) at some time before 1870.;;

Description
''A. × zoeschense'' is a medium-sized tree growing up to 20&amp;nbsp;m (66&amp;nbsp;feet) tall, and almost as wide. The shiny, five-lobed leaves are 10–11 cm long and up to 14 cm broad, dark green, often with purplish edges. The petioles produce a milky latex when broken. The flowers are produced in open corymbs 5–10 cm diameter, each flower small, pale yellow-green, with five sepals but no petals. The fruit is a paired samara 5 cm across; the two seeds are usually sterile.;;

Cultivation
One cultivar, ''A. zoeschense'' 'Annae', was popular as a street tree in previous generations. In the United Kingdom, a mature and magnificent example of'Annae' can be viewed in Westonbirt Arboretum. The Japanese cultivar, 'Kinka', has variegated foliage.;
