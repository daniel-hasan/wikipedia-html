2007 NFL Draft logo
The 2007 National Football League Draft took place at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on April 28 and April 29, 2007. The draft was televised for the 28th consecutive year on ESPN and ESPN2. The NFL Network also broadcast coverage of the event, its second year doing so. There were 255 draft selections this year: 223 regular selections (instead of the typical 224 selections;Cincinnati forfeited their third-round selection (80th overall) as a result of their selection in a supplemental draft (Ahmad Brooks). ;) in rounds one through seven and 32 NFL Draft#Compensatory Picks|compensatory selections, which were announced on March 26, 2007,;; distributed among rounds three through seven. (The official NFL term is &quot;selection,&quot; although they are commonly referred to as &quot;picks&quot;). This was the first draft presided over by new NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. The first round was the longest in the history of the NFL Draft, lasting six hours, eight minutes.;; This year, Mr. Irrelevant was Ramzee Robinson who was selected last (255th overall) to the Detroit Lions.

The biggest surprise of the 2007 NFL Draft was the fall of 
Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn out of the top ten selections. Quinn was projected by some to be drafted first in early mock drafts, but fell to the 22nd pick in the first round, where he was selected by the Cleveland Browns following a trade with the Dallas Cowboys to acquire the pick.;; LSU quarterback JaMarcus Russell replaced Quinn as the projected first selection after his performance in the 2007 Sugar Bowl against Quinn and Notre Dame.;;;;

The following is the breakdown of the 255 players by position:

{|
