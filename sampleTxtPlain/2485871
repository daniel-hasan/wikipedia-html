Sheehan is buried in Vacaville-Elmira Cemetery in Vacaville, California.

Cindy Sheehan paid for the tombstone herself, stating &quot;It is important for the rest of Casey's family to have one... I guess the pain of seeing it etched in marble that he is dead is another pain I will have to deal with.&quot; Cindy Sheehan maintains that the U.S. &quot;government should have paid for it because of its responsibility for his death.&quot; The Department of Veterans Affairs does provide such monuments upon request.; [http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/sheehangrave.asp Claim: Cindy Sheehan failed to provide a tombstone for her son's grave -- Status: true], ''Snopes'' ;
