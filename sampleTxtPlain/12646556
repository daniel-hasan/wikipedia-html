In the U.S. State of Nevada, Interstate 15 begins in Primm, continues through Las Vegas and it crosses the border with Arizona in Mesquite. The freeway runs entirely in Clark County. Many motorists use Interstate 15 to visit Las Vegas as it is the only primary Interstate highway in the city.

Route description

Interstate 15 traverses through Primm at Exit 1 near the California-Nevada state line.
Motorists in California leave the mountainous Mohave Desert and begin a long descent through Ivanpah Valley and Ivanpah Dry Lake.Interstate 15 crosses the Nevada state line at the first exit, Primm.

Once Interstate 15 leaves Primm, the route travels north through the desert with few services. The highway then enters the Las Vegas urban area upon passing the Nevada State Route 160 (Blue Diamond Road) junction.Quickly thereafter, the interstate meets Interstate 215, which provides access to Henderson and McCarran International Airport. 

Interstate 15 passes through Las Vegas, just to the west of the strip.
Interstate 15 travels along the west side of the Las Vegas Strip corridor and just west of downtown Las Vegas just before its junction with Interstate 515 and U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|U.S. Route 95 (the &quot;Spaghetti Bowl&quot; interchage). Then the interstate enters North Las Vegas and continues to run roughly parallel to Las Vegas Boulevard (old U.S. Route 91|US 91) as it leaves the Las Vegas urban limits near the northern junction with the Clark County 215 beltway.

Once Interstate 15 leaves North Las Vegas, the freeway travels northeast and crosses the Muddy River at Glendale and then climbs up onto the Mormon Mesa. At Mesquite, the freeway then crosses the Arizona state line and cuts through the extreme northwestern corner of Arizona through the Virgin River Gorge before entering Utah.

Between Las Vegas and the Nevada state line, the Nevada Department of Transportation added callboxes at one-mile intervals in the mid-2000s, used for motorists who end up with vehicle problems and don't have access to a cell phone.
