Review and events
Bristol Rovers playing in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final at the Millennium Stadium.
The pre-season period was a turbulent one, with a potential take-over of the club by Mike Turl being rejected by then-chairman Geoff Dunford. Directors Kevin Spencer and Colin Williams left the club in protest at the rejection,; followed shortly after by the Bristol Rovers Supporters Club representative on the football club's board, Kim Stuckey.;

Ryan Green had signed for the club from Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United at the end of the previous season,;; and he was joined by three more new players before the start of the 2006-07 season. Sammy Igoe, who had been on loan at Rovers from Millwall F.C.|Millwall the previous season, joined on a full-time basis, young defender Byron Anthony, who had yet to make an appearance in the Football League, joined from Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City, and experienced goalkeeper Steve Phillips crossed the city to join from local rivals Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City.

A number of players left the club following the end of the 2005–06 season. Senior players John Anderson, who had been assistant manager to Paul Trollope during his spell as caretaker manager the previous year,;; Ali Gibb, Jon Bass and Christian Edwards were released, while Jamie Forrester moved to Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City on a free transfer. Also leaving the club were a number of younger players who had failed to earn extensions to their contracts. These were Mark Preece, Matt Thorne, Ben Willshire and goalkeepers Ryan Clarke and Martin Horsell.;;

The first game of the season was away to Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United in League 2, and ended in a 4-1 defeat,;; resulting in the lowest league position, 23rd, that Rovers would occupy all season. As the season progressed, Rovers gradually climbed the league table, eventually clinching a playoff spot after winning their final league match 2-1 against Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United.

The playoff campaign was a high-scoring one, with there being an average of 4⅔ goals per game in the three matches played. The semi-final was against Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City, and was played over Two-legged match|two legs. The first leg at the Memorial Stadium was won 2-1 by Rovers, thanks to goals by Craig Disley and Richard Walker. The second leg was played at Sincil Bank and ended 5-3, with Stuart Campbell, Rickie Lambert, Richard Walker, Sammy Igoe and Sean Rigg scoring the goals. This gave Rovers a 7-4 aggregate win and a place in the final at Wembley Stadium. A record attendance for a League 2 playoff final of 61,589 watched the game, and saw Rovers win the match 3-1 and gain promotion for only the fourth time in the club's history.; Richard Walker scored two of the goals and Sammy Igoe scored the other.

The Carling Cup campaign was a brief one. Rovers were knocked out in the first round by Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town on penalty kicks after drawing the match 1-1. The FA Cup was more successful, with the team reaching the fourth round where they were beaten 1-0 by Derby County F.C.|Derby County. The best cup run of the season was in the Football League Trophy, where they reached the final after beating rivals Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City 1-0 in the southern area final. The game was played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, but resulted in a 3-2 defeat after extra time, the score being 2-2 after 90 minutes.
