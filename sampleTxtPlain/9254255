The effects of Hurricane Isabel in Canada were fairly minor due to Isabel transitioning into an extratropical cyclone before affecting the area. Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6 2003 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 265&amp;nbsp;km/h (165&amp;nbsp;mph) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 165&amp;nbsp;km/h (105&amp;nbsp;mph) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day before entering southern Ontario.

Impact from the storm was fairly minor, including downed trees and power lines across southern Ontario. Isabel was indirectly responsible for one traffic fatality. A group of researchers flew into Isabel over Lake Erie and southern Ontario to study tropical cyclones transitioning into extratropical cyclones. The group also flew into two previous cyclones affecting Canada.

Preparations
Beginning on September 14, four days before Isabel made landfall, and continuing for every subsequent forecast, the National Hurricane Center predicted the center of Isabel would pass into the Canadian province of Ontario before later crossing into Quebec. Initially, it was predicted to enter the country as an extratropical storm with winds exceeding 64&amp;nbsp;km/h (40&amp;nbsp;mph), though later was revised to enter Canada as an extratropical depression. One forecast predicted Isabel to turn to the northeast and pass over Labrador before entering the Atlantic Ocean, though subsequent forecasts correctly predicted the extratropical remnant would merge with another extratropical storm over south-central Canada.;;

On September 18, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a heavy rainfall warning and wind warnings for portions of southern Ontario. A gale warning was also issued for Lake Ontario and the eastern region of Lake Erie.;; Subsequently, officials issued a gale warning for the Saint Lawrence River;; and Georgian Bay, and also extended the heavy rainfall warning to portions of northern Ontario.;; Most warnings were canceled when the extratropical remnant weakened further.;; A news report on September 14 warned conditions were probable for a repeat of the disaster caused by Hurricane Hazel 49&amp;nbsp;years prior, resulting in widespread media coverage on the hurricane.;;

A group of Canadian researchers organized a Convair 580 flight out of Ottawa to fly into Isabel to study the structure of a storm transitioning into an extratropical cyclone by collecting data from radar and dropsondes. The plane flew generally south of the center, and while passing through the area of heaviest precipitation, ice accumulated up to 25&amp;nbsp;mm (1&amp;nbsp;inch) thick, forcing the pilot to descend. The flight was the first Convair flight into a storm undergoing extratropical transition over land, though was similar to the two previous flights over water for Hurricane Michael in 2000 and Tropical Storm Karen in 2001.;

Swells from Isabel produced moderate surf conditions along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, particularly in the Gulf of Maine. No direct observations were recorded, though swells of 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;m (6 to 10&amp;nbsp;feet) were expected.; 

Isabel produced rough surf in Lake Ontario while passing the lake, with waves reaching 4&amp;nbsp;m (13&amp;nbsp;feet) along the western portion of the lake. At Hamilton, the waves surpassed seawalls and produced spray onto coastal streets.;; Rainfall from the storm first began affecting Ontario early on September 19.; The strongest convection moved over the southern portion of the province before weakening, resulting in light to moderate precipitation across the region. Rainfall reached 53.4&amp;nbsp;mm (2.1&amp;nbsp;inches) at Point Pelee,; with unofficial reports of 46&amp;nbsp;mm (1.8&amp;nbsp;inches) at Sarnia and 33.2&amp;nbsp;mm (1.3&amp;nbsp;inches) at Toronto Pearson International Airport.;; Most of the rainfall fell near and to the west of the storm's track,; causing some localized flooding.;

The strong pressure gradient between Isabel and a high pressure system over the eastern portion of the country produced strong easterly winds across Lakes Ontario and Erie.; A buoy in Lake Ontario reported a peak gust of 78&amp;nbsp;km/h (49&amp;nbsp;mph).; On land, winds reached 55&amp;nbsp;km/h (34&amp;nbsp;mph) with gusts to 73&amp;nbsp;km/h (45&amp;nbsp;mph) in numerous locations,; with Port Colborne reporting a peak gust of 81&amp;nbsp;km/h (51&amp;nbsp;mph).; The winds resulted in downed trees across southwestern Ontario, with many power outages reported from trees falling onto power lines.; One person died in a traffic fatality in Ontario as a result of the storm.;;

Power workers throughout Canada assisted the severely affected power companies from Effects of Hurricane Isabel in Maryland and Washington, D.C.|Maryland to North Carolina.;; Hydro-Qu√©bec sent 25&amp;nbsp;teams to the New York City area to assist in power outages.;;
