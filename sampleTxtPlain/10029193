Paul Anthony Cook (aka Paul Cooke), born 18 December 1961 is an English drummer, percussionist and composer best known for his work on the album ''Diamond Life'' by the group he co-founded, Sade. 

Cook formed Sade in 1982 with fellow Pride band members, Sade Adu, Stuart Matthewman and Paul Spencer Denman. His time with the band ended in 1984. Mr. Cook has stated that he was fired from the band for voicing objections to the singer's signing of a solo contract, which he felt violated their partnership agreement.;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA_5Szqrf00 Paul Cooke interview on YouTube];
