Karnataka (, help:IPA|pronounced ) is a state in the southern part of India. It was created on November 1 1956, with the passing of the States Reorganisation Act. Originally known as the ''State of Mysore'', it was renamed ''Karnataka'' in 1973. 

Karnataka is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, Goa to the northwest, Maharashtra to thenorth, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and Kerala to the southwest. The state covers an area ofor 5.83% of the total geographical area of India. It is the eighth largest Indian state by area, the ninth largest by population and comprises 29 districts. Kannada is the official and most widely spoken language.

Though several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that ''Karnataka'' is derived from the Kannada words ''karu'' and ''nādu'', meaning ''elevated land''. ''Karu nadu'' may also be read as ''Karu'' (black) and ''nadu'' (region), as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayaluseeme region of Karnataka. The British used the word ''Carnatic'' (sometimes ''Karnatak'') to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna River.;See Lord Macaulay's life of Clive and James Tallboys Wheeler: ''Early History of British India'', London (1878) p.98. The principal meaning is the western half of this area, but the rulers there controlled the Coromandel Coast as well.; 

With an antiquity that dates to the paleolithic, Karnataka has also been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient India. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions. Writers in the Kannada language have received the most number of Jnanpith awards in India.Bangalore is the capital city of the state and is at the forefront of the rapid economic and technological development that India is experiencing.

History

The history of Karnataka can be traced back to a paleolithic hand-axe culture evidenced by discoveries of, among other things, hand axes and cleavers in the region. Evidence of neolithic and megalithic cultures have also been found in the state. Gold discovered in Harappa was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesize about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the Indus Valley Civilization in 3000 BCE.;;;; Prior to the third century BCE, most of Karnataka was part of the Nanda Empire before coming under the Mauryan empire of Emperor Ashoka. Four centuries of Satavahana rule followed, allowing them to control large areas of Karnataka. The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise of the earliest native kingdoms, the Kadambas and the Western Gangas, marking the region's emergence as an independent political entity. The Kadamba Dynasty, founded by Mayurasharma, had its capital at Banavasi;;From the Talagunda inscription (Dr. B. L. Rice in Kamath, 2001, p30);;Moares (1931), p10; the Western Ganga Dynasty was formed with Talakad as its capital.;Adiga and Sheik Ali in Adiga (2006), p89;;Ramesh (1984), pp. 1-2

These were also the first kingdoms to use Kannada in administration, as evidenced by the Halmidi inscription and a fifth-century copper coin discovered at Banavasi.;From the Halmidi inscription (Ramesh 1984, pp. 10–11);;Kamath (2001), p10; These dynasties were followed by imperial Kannada empires such as the Badami Chalukyas,;The Chalukyas hailed from present-day Karnataka (Keay 2000, p168);;The Chalukyas were native ''Kannadigas'' (N. Laxminarayana Rao and Dr. S. C. Nandinath in Kamath 2001, p57); the Rashtrakuta Empire of Manyakheta;Altekar (1934), pp. 21–24;;Masica (1991), pp. 45-46; and the Western Chalukya Empire,;Balagamve in Mysore territory was an early power centre (Cousens 1926, p10, p105);;Tailapa II, the founder king was the governor of Tardavadi in modern Bijapur district, under the Rashtrakutas (Kamath (2001), p101); which ruled over large parts of the Deccan and had their capitals in what is now Karnataka. The Western Chalukyas patronised a unique style of architecture and Kannada literature which became a precursor to the Hoysala art of 12th century.;Kamath (2001), p115;;Foekema (2003), p9;

At the turn of the first millennium, the Hoysalas gained power in the region. Literature flourished during this time, which led to the distinctive Kannada literary metres and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the Vesara style of architecture.;Kamath (2001), pp132–134;;Sastri (1955), pp. 358-9, p 361;;Foekema (1996), p14;;Kamath (2001), pp. 122-4; The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under its rule. In the early 14th century, Harihara and Bukka Raya established the Vijayanagara empire with its capital, ''Hosapattana'' (later named Vijayanagara), on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district. The empire rose as a bulwark against Muslim advances into South India, which it completely controlled for over two centuries.;Kamath 2001, pp. 157–160;;Kulke and Rothermund (2004), p188; 

In 1565, Karnataka and the rest of South India experienced a major geopolitical shift when the Vijayanagara Empire fell to a confederation of Islamic sultanates in the Battle of Talikota.;Kamath (2001), pp. 190-191; The Bijapur Sultanate, which had risen after the demise of the Bahmani Sultanate of Bidar, soon took control of the Deccan; it was defeated by the Moghuls in the late 17th century.;Kamath (2001), p201;;Kamath (2001), p202; The Bahamani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and Indo-Saracenic architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points of this style.;Kamath (2001), p207; 

An Anglo-Mysore wars|inveterate enemy of the British, Tippu Sultan was one of the most powerfulrulers in India before the advent of the British Raj

In the period that followed, parts of northern Karnataka were ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad, the British, and other powers. In the south, the Mysore Kingdom, former vassals of the Vijayanagara Empire, was briefly independent.;Kamath (2001), p171; With the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, Haidar Ali, the commander-in-chief of the Mysore army, gained control of the region. After his death, the kingdom was inherited by his son Tippu Sultan.;Kamath (2001), p171, p173, p174, p204; To contain European expansion in South India, Haidar Ali and later Tippu Sultan fought four significant Anglo-Mysore Wars, the last of which resulted in Tippu Sultan's death and the incorporation of Mysore into the British Raj in 1799.;Kamath (2001), pp. 231–234; The Kingdom of Mysore was restored to the Wodeyars and Mysore remained a princely state under the British Raj.

As the &quot;doctrine of lapse&quot; gave way to dissent and resistance from princely states across the country, Kittur Chennamma, Sangolli Rayanna and others spearheaded rebellions in Karnataka in 1830, nearly three decades before the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Other uprisings followed, such as the ones at Supa, Bagalkot, Shorapur, Nargund and Dandeli. These rebellions which coincided with the 1857 war of independence were led by Mundargi Bhimarao, Bhaskar Rao Bhave, the Halagali Bedas, Venkatappa Nayaka and others. By the late 19th century, the freedom movement had gained momentum; Karnad Sadashiva Rao, Aluru Venkata Raya, S. Nijalingappa, Kengal Hanumanthaiah, Nittoor Srinivasa Rau and others carried on the struggle into the early 20th century.;;

After India's independence, the Maharaja, Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, allowed his kingdom's accession to India. In 1950, Mysore became an Indian state of the same name; the former Maharaja served as its ''Rajpramukh'' (head of state) until 1975.Following the long-standing demand of theEkikarana Movement, Kodagu and Kannada speaking regions from the adjoining states of Madras, Hyderabad and Bombay were incorporated into the Mysore state, under the States Reorganization Act of 1956. The thus expanded state was renamedKarnataka, seventeen years later, in 1973.;;

Geography

Jog Falls are one of the highest waterfalls in India, formed by Sharavathi River

The state has three principal geographical zones: the coastal region of Karavali, the hilly Malnad region comprising the Western Ghats and the Bayaluseeme region comprising the plains of the Deccan plateau. The bulk of the state is in the Bayaluseeme region, the northern part of which is the second largest arid region in India.; ; The highest point in Karnataka is the Mullayanagiri hills in Chikkamagaluru district which has an altitude of . Some of the important rivers in Karnataka are the Kaveri, the Tungabhadra, the Krishna and the Sharavathi.

Karnataka consists of four main types of geological formations;; — the ''Archean complex'' made up of Dharwad schists and granitic gneisses, the ''Proterozoic'' non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the ''Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits'' and the tertiary and recent laterites and alluvial deposits.Significantly, about 60% of the state is comprised of the ''Archean complex'' which consist of gneisses, granites and charnockite rocks.Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Spodosols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Oxisols, Aridisols, Vertisols, Andisols and Histosols.; Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. Red, lateritic, black, alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.

Karnataka experiences four seasons. The winter in January and February is followed by summer between March and May, the monsoon season between June and September and the post-monsoon season from October till December. Meteorologically, Karnataka is divided into three zones — coastal, north interior and south interior.

Agumbe in the Shivamogga district receives the second highest annual rainfall in India.; Agumbe's receiving the second highest rainfall in India is mentioned by ; The highest recorded temperature wasat Raichur and the lowest recorded temperature wasat Bidar.

Aboutof Karnataka (i.e. 20% of the state's geographic area) is covered by forests. The forests are classified as reserved, protected, unclosed, village and private forests. The percentage of forested area is slightly less than the all-India average of about 23%, and significantly less than the 33% prescribed in the National Forest Policy.;;

He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the Cheluvanarayana Temple and a well organised Matha were built. He was patronized by the Hoysala king, Vishnuvardhana. (Kamath 2001), pp. 150-152;In the twelfth century, Veerashaivism emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of this movement were Basava, Akka Mahadevi and Allama Prabhu, who established the Anubhava Mantapa where the philosophy of ''Shakti Vishishtadvaita'' was expounded.

Language

Halmidi inscription (450 CE) is the earliest attested inscription in Kannada language

The Kannada language is the official language of the state and is the native language of approximately 65% of Karnataka's population.;; Kannada played a crucial role in the creation of Karnataka since linguistic demographics was a major criterion chosen to create the state in 1956. Tulu, Kodava Takk and Konkani are other major native languages that share a long history in the state. Urdu is spoken widely by the Muslim population. Less widely spoken languages include Beary bashe and certain dialects such as Sankethi. Kannada features a rich and ancient body of literature covering topics as diverse as Jainism, Vachanas, and Haridasa Sahitya. Evidence from edicts during the time of Ashoka the Great suggest that the Kannada script and its literature were influenced by Buddhist literature. The Halmidi inscription, the earliest attested full-length inscription in the Kannada language and script, is dated to 450 CE while the earliest available literary work, the Kavirajamarga, has been dated to 850 CE. References made in the Kavirajamarga, however, prove that Kannada literature flourished in the ''Chattana'', ''Beddande'' and ''Melvadu'' metres during earlier centuries.;Narasimhacharya (1988), p12, p17; 

Rashtrakavi Kuvempu, a doyen of 20th century Kannada literature

Contemporary Kannada literature is well recognized in the arena of Indian literature, with seven Kannada writers winning India's highest literary honour, the Jnanpith award, which is the highest for any language inIndia.;;
Tulu is spoken mainly in the coastal districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada. ''Tulu Mahabharato'', written by ''Arunabja'' in Tulu script, is the oldest surviving Tulu text.; ; The Tulu language now uses the Kannada script due to the gradual decline of the Tulu script, which was in use until a few centuries ago. The Kodavas who mainly reside in the Kodagu district, speak Kodava Takk. Two regional variations of the language exist, the northern ''Mendale Takka'' and the southern ''Kiggaati Takka''.; ; Konkani is mostly spoken in the Uttara Kannada district and in some parts of the Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts. Both Kodava Takk and Konkani use the Kannada script for writing. English is the medium of education in many schools and widely used for business communication in technology-related companies and BPOs. 

All of the state's languages are patronised and promoted by governmental and quasi-governmental bodies.The Kannada Sahitya Parishat and the ''Kannada Sahitya Akademi'' are responsible for the promotion of Kannada while the ''Karnataka Konkani Sahitya Akademi'',; ; The ''Tulu Sahitya Akademi'' and the ''Kodava Sahitya Akademi'' promote their respective languages.
