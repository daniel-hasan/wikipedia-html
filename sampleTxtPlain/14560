Ireland (Irish: ''Éire'', ) is a country in north-western Europe. The modern sovereign state occupies five-sixths of the island of Ireland, which was partitioned in 1921. It is bordered by Northern Ireland (part of the United Kingdom) to the north, by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and by the Irish Sea to the east. The term ''Republic of Ireland'' (Irish: ''Poblacht na hÉireann'') is &quot;the description of the State&quot;, but not its constitutional name.;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA22Y1948S2.html Section 2] of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 (Irl).;

Ireland is among the richest, most developed and peaceful countries on earth, having the fifth highest Gross Domestic Product per capita, second highest Gross Domestic Product (Purchasing Power Parity) per capita and having the fifth highest Human Development Index rank. The country also boasts the highest quality of life in the world, ranking first in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Quality-of-life index. Ireland was ranked fourth on the Global Peace Index. The state also has high rankings for its education system, political freedom and civil rights, press freedom and economic freedom; as a result it was ranked fourth from the bottom on the Failed States Index, being one of the few &quot;sustainable&quot; states in the world.

Ireland has a developed, modern, knowledge economy, focusing on services and high-tech industries. The state is a member of the EU, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD and the UN. However, the nation's policy of neutrality means it is not a member of NATO. Ireland's population is the fastest growing in Europe, with an annual growth rate of 2.5%.

Name


''Bunreacht na hÉireann'' (Irish), the constitution of Ireland, provides that &quot;the name of the state is Éire, or, in the English language, 'Ireland'.&quot; The state is also described as the &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot;, in order to distinguish it from the island of Ireland and from Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland Act defined ''Republic of Ireland'' as the description of the state in 1949 (the purpose of the act being to declare that the state was a republic rather than a form of constitutional monarchy). However, because this was a statutory provision, the constitutional name of &quot;Ireland&quot; remains the official ''name'' of the state, whilst &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; is a ''description'' of the state. The form ''Ireland'' is used for official purposes in English language documents such as treaties, government and legal documents, and membership of international organisations:, the form ''Éire'' is used when these are Irish language documents. However with Irish being named the European Union's twenty-third official language in 2007, the state will be referred to in both constitutional official languages, the Irish and English languages, similarly to other countries such as Finland and Belgium using more than one language at EU level.This means the label 'Éire-Ireland' will be used on various signage and nameplates referring to the state.;[http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/story.asp?j=187261558&amp;p=y87z6zzEU&amp;n=187262318 EU to call country 'Éire Ireland'], [http://www.irishexaminer.com/ Irish Examiner], 27 June 2006.; 
The state is also known by other names in English, such as , ''The Free State'' and the ''Twenty-six Counties''. Occasionally in the United Kingdom the state is referred to colloquially as Southern Ireland, this term was only used officially for a brief period in Irish history: Irish people generally understand the phrase &quot;southern Ireland&quot; to mean Munster. When differentiating between both sides of the border in Ireland, the state is sometimes described as &quot;The South&quot;, and likewise Northern Ireland as &quot;The North&quot;.

The state has had more than one official title. The all-island revolutionary state, declared in 1919 by the large majority of Irish Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Members of (the United Kingdom) Parliament elected in 1918, was known as the &quot;Irish Republic&quot;; when the present smaller state achievedindependence in 1922, it became known as the &quot;Irish Free State&quot; (in the Irish language ), a name that was retained until 1937.

History


The state known today as Ireland came into being when 26 of the counties of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (UK) in 1922. The remaining six counties remained within the United Kingdom as Northern Ireland. This action, known as the Partition of Ireland, evolved out of four attempts, 1886, 1893, 1914 and 1920 to introduce Home Rule to the whole of Ireland and came about because of complex constitutional developments in the early twentieth century. 

It was preceded by the Easter Rising of 1916, when Irish volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army took over sites in Dublin and Galway under terms expressed in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. The seven signatories of this proclamation, Patrick Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh, Thomas Clarke, Sean MacDiarmada, Joseph Plunkett, Eamonn Ceannt and James Connolly, were executed, along with nine others, and thousands were interned precipitating the Irish War of Independence.

=Early background=
From the Act of Union on 1 January 1801 until 6 December 1922, Ireland had been part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. During the Great Famine from 1845 to 1849 the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30 percent. One million Irish died of starvation and another 1.5 million emigrated,;; which set the pattern of emigration for the century to come and would result in a constant decline up to the 1960s. From 1874, but particularly from 1880 under Charles Stewart Parnell, the Irish Parliamentary Party moved to prominence through widespread agrarian agitation that won improved tenant land reforms and with its attempts to win two Home Rule Bills, which would have granted Ireland limited national autonomy within the United Kingdom. These nevertheless led to the “grass-roots” control of national affairs under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 previously in the hands of landlord dominated grand juries.

=Home Rule statute=
Home Rule seemed certain in 1911 when the House of Lords lost their veto, and John Redmond secured the Third Home Rule Act 1914. The Unionist movement, however, had been growing since 1886 among Irish Protestants after the introduction of the first home rule bill, fearing that they would face discrimination and lose economic and social privileges if Irish Catholics were to achieve real political power. Though Irish unionism existed throughout the whole of Ireland, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century unionism was particularly strong in parts of Ulster, where industrialisation was more common in contrast to the more agrarian rest of the island. (Any tariff barriers would, it was feared, most heavily hit that region.) In addition, the Protestant population was more strongly located in Ulster, with unionist majorities existing in about four counties. 

=Mounting resistance=
Under the leadership of the Dublin-born Sir Edward Carson of the Irish Unionist Party and the northerner Sir James Craig of the Ulster Unionist Party unionists became strongly militant in order to oppose ''the Coercion of Ulster''. In 1914, to avoid rebellion with Ulster, the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, with agreement of the Irish Parliamentary Party#Home Rule succeeds|Irish Party leadership, amended a clause into the bill providing for home rule for 26 of the 32 counties, with an as of yet undecided new set of measures to be introduced for the area to be temporarily excluded. Though it received the Royal Assent and was placed on the statute books, the Third Home Rule Act 1914's implementation was suspended until after the Great War. (The war at that stage was expected to be ended by 1915, not the four years it did ultimately last.) For the prior reasons of ensuring the implementation of the Act at the end of the war, Redmond and his Irish National Volunteers supported the Allied cause, and 175,000joined Irish regiments of the 10th (Irish), 16th (Irish) and 36th (Ulster) divisions of the New British Army (See: [http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/index.asp?docID=2517 Department of the Taoiseach] - Irish Soldiers in the First World War).

In January 1919, after the December 1918 general elections, 73 of Ireland's 106 MPs elected were Sinn Féin members who refused to take their seats in the British House of Commons. Instead, they set up an extra-legal Irish parliament called Dáil Éireann. First Dáil|This Dáil in January 1919 issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence and proclaimed an Irish Republic. The Declaration was mainly a restatement of the 1916 Proclamation with the additional provision that Ireland was no longer a part of the United Kingdom. Despite this, the new Irish Republic remained unrecognised internationally except by Lenin's Russian Republic. Nevertheless the Republic's Aireacht (ministry) sent a delegation under Ceann Comhairle Seán T. O'Kelly to the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, but it was not admitted. 

After the bitterly fought War of Independence, representatives of the British government and the Irish treaty delegates, led by Arthur Griffith, Robert Barton and Michael Collins negotiated the Anglo-Irish Treaty in London from October 11th -6th December 1921.The Irish delegates set up headquarters at Hans Place in Knightsbridge and it was here in private discussions that the decision was taken at 11.15am on 5th December to recommend the Treaty to Dáil Éireann.Under the Treaty the British agreed to the establishment of an independent Irish State whereby the Irish Free State (in the Irish language ''Saorstát Éireann'') with dominion status was created. The Dáil Éireann narrowly ratified the treaty.

The Treaty was not entirely satisfactory to either side. It gave more concessions to the Irish than the British had intended to give but did not go far enough to satisfy republican aspirations. The new Irish Free State was in theory to cover the entire island, subject to the proviso that six counties in the north-east, termed &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; (which had been created as one of the two separate Home Rule entities under the ''Government of Ireland Act 1920'') could opt out and choose to remain part of the United Kingdom, which they duly did. The remaining twenty-six counties (originally &quot;Southern Ireland&quot; under the Act) became the Irish Free State, a constitutional monarchy over which the British monarch reigned (from 1927 with the title King of Ireland). It had a Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General, a bicameral parliament, a cabinet called the &quot;Executive Council&quot; and a prime minister called the President of the Executive Council.

=Permeating partition=
The Irish Civil War was the direct consequence of the creation of the Irish Free State. Anti-Treaty forces, led by Éamon de Valera, objected to the fact that acceptance of the Treaty ''abolished'' the Irish Republic of 1919 to which they had sworn loyalty, arguing in the face of public support for the settlement that the &quot;people have no right to do wrong&quot;. They objected most to the fact that the state would remain part of the British Commonwealth and that Teachta Dála|Teachtaí Dála would have to swear an oath of fidelity to King George V and his successors. Pro-Treaty forces, led by Michael Collins, argued that the Treaty gave &quot;not the ultimate freedom that all nations aspire to and develop, but the freedom to achieve it&quot;.

At the start of the war, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) split into two opposing camps: a pro-treaty IRA and an Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|anti-treaty IRA. The pro-Treaty IRA became part of the new National Army. However, through the lack of an effective command structure in the anti-Treaty IRA, and their defensive tactics throughout the war, Collins and his pro-treaty forces were able to build up an army with many tens of thousands of WWI veterans from the 1922 disbanded Irish regiments of the British Army, capable of overwhelming the anti-Treatyists. British supplies of artillery, aircraft, machine-guns and ammunition boosted pro-treaty forces, and the threat of a return of Crown forces to the Free State removed any doubts about the necessity of enforcing the treaty. The lack of public support for the anti-treaty Irregulars, and the determination of the government to overcome them, contributed significantly to their defeat.

The National Army suffered 800 fatalities and perhaps as many as 4,000 people were killed altogether. The destruction caused by the war caused considerable economic damage to the Free State in the earliest days of its existence. And Northern Ireland became irreversibly hardened in distancing itself entirely from the Free State.

Republic of Ireland population during the twentieth century
=New Constitution=
On 29 December 1937, a new constitution, the Constitution of Ireland, came into force. It replaced the Irish Free State by a new state called simply &quot;Ireland&quot;. Though this state's ''constitutional'' structures provided for a President of Ireland instead of a king, it was not technically a republic; the principal key role possessed by a head of state, that of symbolically representing the state internationally remained vested, in ''statute law'', in the King as an ''organ''. The Office of Governor-General was hereby abolished.

The Irish state remained neutral during World War II, a period it described as The Emergency. 

On 21 December 1948, the Republic of Ireland Act declared a republic, with the functions previously given to the Governor-General acting on the behalf of the King given instead to the President of Ireland.

The Irish state had remained a member of the then-British Commonwealth after independence until the declaration of a republic on 18 April 1949. Under Commonwealth rules declaration of a republic automatically terminated membership of the association; since a reapplication for membership was not made, Ireland consequently ceased to be a member.

The Republic of Ireland joined the United Nations in 1955 and the European Community (now the European Union) in 1973. Irish governments have sought the peaceful reunification of Ireland and have usually cooperated with the British government in the violent conflict involving many paramilitaries and the British Army in Northern Ireland known as &quot;The Troubles&quot;. A peace settlement for Northern Ireland, the Belfast Agreement, was approved in 1998 in referendums north and south of the border, and is currently being implemented.

Politics
President of Ireland, Mary McAleese


The state is a republic, with a parliamentary system of government. The President of Ireland, who serves as head of state, is elected for a seven-year term and can be re-elected only once. The president is largely a figurehead but can still carry out certain constitutional powers and functions, aided by the Council of State, an advisory body. The(prime minister), is appointed by the president on the nomination of parliament. Theis normally the leader of the political party which wins the most seats in the national elections. It has become normal in the Republic for coalitions to form a government, and there has not been a single-party government since 1989.

The bicameral parliament, the , consists of a Senate, , and a lower house, . Theis composed of sixty members; eleven nominated by the , six elected by two universities, and 43 elected by public representatives from panels of candidates established on a vocational basis. Thehas 166 members, , elected to represent multi-seat constituencies under the system of proportional representation by means of the Single Transferable Vote. Under the constitution, parliamentary elections must be held at least every seven years, though a lower limit may be set by statute law. The current statutory maximum term is every five years.

Leinster House, the seat of(the Irish parliament).
The Government is constitutionally limited to fifteen members. No more than two members of the Government can be selected from the Senate, and the ,(deputy prime minister) and Minister for Finance ''must'' be members of the . The current government consists of a coalition of three parties;underBertie Ahern, the Green Party under new leader John Gormley and the Progressive Democrats under Minister for Health and Children Mary Harney. The last scheduled general election to the Dáil took place on 24 May 2007, after it was called by the Taoiseach on 29th April.

The main opposition in the currentconsists of Fine Gael under Enda Kenny, The Labour Party under new leader Eamon Gilmore and Sinn Féin. A number of independent deputies also sit in Dáil Éireann though less in number than before the recent election.

Ireland joined the European Union in 1973 but has chosen to remain outside the Schengen Treaty. Citizens of the UK can freely enter Ireland without a passport thanks to the Common Travel Area, however some form of identification is required at airports and seaports.

Counties

The Republic of Ireland traditionally had twenty-six counties, and these are still used in cultural and sporting contexts. Dáil Éireann|Dáil constituencies are required by statute to follow county boundaries, as far as possible. Hence counties with greater populations have multiple constituencies (e.g. Limerick East/West) and some constituencies consist of more than one county (e.g. Sligo-North Leitrim), but by and large, the actual county boundaries are not crossed.

As local government units, however, some have been restructured, with the now-abolished County Dublin distributed among three new county councils in the 1990s and County Tipperary having been administratively two separate counties since the 1890s, giving a present-day total of twenty-nine administrative counties and five cities. The five cities &amp;mdash; Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, and Waterford (Kilkenny is a city but does not possess a city council) &amp;mdash; are administered separately from the remainder of their respective counties. Five boroughs &amp;mdash; Clonmel, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford &amp;mdash; have a level of autonomy within the county:

Geography, climate, and environment
Topography of Ireland
Cliffs of Moher, Co. Clare


The island of Ireland extends over 84,421 Square kilometres (32,556 square miles), of which 83% (approx. five-sixths) belong to the Republic (70,280 km²; 27,103&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) and the remainder constituting Northern Ireland. It is bound to the west by the Atlantic Ocean, to the northeast by the North Channel. To the east is found the Irish Sea which reconnects to the ocean via the southwest with St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea. The west-coast of Ireland mostly consists of cliffs, hills and low mountains (the highest point being Carrauntoohil at 1,038 m or 3,406 ft). The interior of the country is relatively flat land, traversed by rivers such as the River Shannon and several large lakes or ''loughs''. The centre of the country is part of the River Shannon watershed, containing large areas of bogland, used for peat extraction and production.

The local temperate climate is modified by the North Atlantic Current and is relatively mild. Summer temperatures exceed 30 °C (86 °F) usually once every decade, though commonly reach 29 °C (84 °F) most summers, and freezes occur only occasionally in winter, with temperatures below -6 °C (21 °F) being uncommon. Precipitation is very common, with some parts of the country getting up to 275 days with rain annually. 

Chief city conurbations are the capital Dublin 1,045,769 on the east coast, Cork 190,384 in the south, Limerick 90,757 in the mid-west, Galway 72,729 on the west coast, and Waterford 49,213 on the south east coast (see Cities in Ireland).

Impact of agriculture
The long history of agricultural production coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods (such as pesticide and fertiliser use) has placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland. Agriculture is the main factor determining current land use patterns in Ireland, leaving limited land to preserve natural habitats (also forestry and urban development to a lesser extent),;; in particular for larger wild mammals with greater territorial requirements. With no top predator in Ireland, populations of animals that cannot be controlled by smaller predators (such as the fox) are controlled by annual culling, i.e. semi-wild populations of deer. A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. Their ecosystems stretch across the countryside and act as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. 

Pollution from agricultural activities is one of the principal sources of environmental damage. &quot;Runoff&quot; of contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes impact the natural fresh-water ecosystems.;; Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy which supported these agricultural practices and contributed to land-use distortions are undergoing reforms.; 
; The CAP still subsidises some potentially destructive agricultural practices, however, the recent reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.; 

Forest covers about 10% of the country, with most designated for commercial production.; Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting a broad range of native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the country, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. This is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.; 
Seanad Éireann|Seanad Debate involving Former Minister for Environment Heritage and Local Government;

Education

The education systems are largely under the direction of the government via the Minister for Education and Science (currently Mary Hanafin, TD). Recognised primary and secondary schools must adhere to the curriculum established by authorities that have power to set them.

The education systems in Ireland are complex due to a confusion of ownership, control and curricular assessment. This has arisen because the systems developed over long periods of time with variable influence by several key players, including the Irish state. Unlike in countries such as France, Ireland's state education system is largely limited to the content of the curriculum, although this too is mediated by voluntary interests. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, currently ranks Ireland's education as the 20th best in the world, being significantly higher than the OECD average.;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf;

Primary, Secondary and Third (University/College) level education are all free in the Republic of Ireland for all EU citizens.

Economy

Disposable income per person as a percentage of the national average. 
The economy of Ireland has transformed in recent years from an agricultural focus to one dependent on trade, industry and investment. Economic growth in Ireland averaged an exceptional 10% from 1995–2000, and 7% from 2001–2004. Industry, which accounts for 46% of GDP, about 80% of exports, and 29% of the labour force, now takes the place of agriculture as the country's leading sector. 

Exports play a fundamental role in the state's robust growth, but the economy also benefits from the accompanyingrise in consumer spending, construction, and business investment. On paper, the country is the largest exporter of software-related goods and services in the world. In fact, a lot of foreign software, and sometimes music, is filtered through the country to avail of the state's non-taxing of royalties from copyrighted goods.

A key part of economic policy, since 1987, has been Social Partnership which is a neo-corporatist set of voluntary 'pay pacts' between the Government, employers and trades unions. These usually set agreed pay rises for three-year periods.

The state joined in launching the Euro currency system in January 1999 (leaving behind the Irish pound) along with eleven other EU nations. The 1995 to 2000 period of high economic growth led many to call the country the Celtic Tiger. The economy felt the impact of the global economic slowdown in 2001, particularly in the high-tech export sector — the growth rate in that area was cut by nearly half. GDP growth continued to be relatively robust, with a rate of about 6% in 2001 and 2002. Growth for 2004 was over 4%, and for 2005 was 4.7%.

With high growth came high levels of inflation, particularly in the capital city. Prices in Dublin, where nearly 30% of Ireland's population lives, are considerably higher than elsewhere in the country,; - CSO; especially in the property market.

Measuring Ireland's level of income per capita is a complicated issue. Ireland possesses the second highest GDP (PPP) per capita in the world (US$43,600 as of 2006), behind Luxembourg, and the fourth highest Human Development Index, which is calculated partially on the basis of GDP per capita. However, many economists feel that GDP per capita is an inappropriate measure of national income for Ireland, as it neglects the fact that much income generated in Ireland belongs to multinational companies and eventually goes offshore. Another measure, Gross National Income per head, takes account of this and therefore many economists feel it is a superior measure of income in the country. In 2005, the World Bank measured Ireland's GNI per head at $41,140 - the seventh highest in the world, sixth highest in Western Europe, and the third highest of any EU member state. Also, a study by ''The Economist'' foundIreland to have the best quality of life in the world.; - The Economist; This study employed GDP per capita as a measure of income rather than GNI per capita. 

The positive reports and economic statistics mask several underlying imbalances. The construction sector, which is inherently cyclical in nature, now accounts for a significant component of Ireland's GDP. A recent downturn in residential property market sentiment has highlighted the over-exposure of the Irish economy to construction, which now presents a threat to economic growth.; 
;; 
;; 
; 
Several successive years of unbalanced economic growth have also led to huge inequality between the strata of Irish society (see Economy of the Republic of Ireland#Recent Developments|Economy of the Republic of Ireland - Recent developments). Poverty figures show that 6.8% of Ireland's population suffer &quot;consistent poverty&quot;.; CSO, 2004.;

Military


Ireland's armed forces are organised under the Irish Defence Forces (). The Irish Army is relatively small compared to other neighbouring armies in the region, but is well equipped, with 8,500 full-time military personnel (13,000 in the reserve army).;[http://www.military.ie/army/intro.htm Irish Defence Forces, Army (accessed 15 June 2006)]; This is principally due to Ireland's policy of neutrality,; See Gilland, Karin. &quot;Ireland: Neutrality and the International Use of Force&quot;, p. 143, in Philip P. Everts and Pierangelo Isernia, ''Public Opinion and the International Use of Force'', Routledge, 2001. ISBN 0415218047.; and its &quot;triple-lock&quot; rules governing participation in conflicts whereby approval must be given by the UN, the Government and the Dáil before any Irish troops are deployed into a conflict zone.;; Deployments of Irish soldiers cover UN peace-keeping duties, protection of the Republic's territorial waters (in the case of the Irish Naval Service) and Aid to Civil Power operations in the state. ''See Irish neutrality''. 

There is also an Irish Air Corps and Reserve Defence Forces (Irish Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve) under the Defence Forces. The Irish Army Rangers is a special forces branch which operates under the aegis of the army.

Over 40,000 Irish servicemen have served in UN peacekeeping missions around the world.

The Republic's air facilities were used by the U.S. military, for the delivery of military personnel involved in the 2003 invasion of Iraq through Shannon Airport; previously the airport had been used for the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. This is part of a longer history of use of Shannon for controversial military transport, which is largely unbiased towards any particular military alliance. The airport was used previously by the US in the First Gulf War and by the Soviet Union during the Cuban Missile Crisis.;;; - Tony Gregory speaking in Dáil Éireann;

During the Second World War, though officially neutral, the Republic supplied similar, though more extensive, support for the Allied Forces. ''See Irish neutrality during World War II''.

Genetic research suggests that the first settlers of Ireland, and parts of North-Western Europe, came through migrations from Iberia following the end of the most recent ice age.;[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7817 Myths of British ancestry] - Prospect Magazine; After the Mesolithic, the Neolithic and Bronze Age migrants introduced Celtic culture and languages to Ireland.;[http://www.breakingnews.ie/2004/09/09/story165780.html Geneticists find Celtic links to Spain and Portugal] - breakingnews.ie; These later migrants from the Neolithic to Bronze Age still represent a minority of the genetic heritage of Irish people. (&quot;Origins of the British&quot;, Stephen Oppenheimer, 2006);[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=15309688 The Longue Durée of Genetic Ancestry: Multiple Genetic Marker Systems and Celtic Origins on the Atlantic Facade of Europe] - PUBMED; Culture spread throughout the island, and the Gaelic tradition became the dominant form in Ireland. Today, Irish people are mainly of Gaelic ancestry, and although some of the population is also of Norse, Anglo-Norman, English, Scottish, French and Welsh ancestry, these groups have been assimilated and do not form distinct minority groups. Gaelic culture and language forms an important part of national identity. In the UK, Irish Travellers are a recognised ethnic minority group, politically (but not ethnically) linked with mainland European Roma and Gypsy groups,;[http://www.cre.gov.uk/gdpract/g_and_t_facts.html ''Commission for Racial Equality:'' Gypsies and Irish Travellers: The facts]; although in the Republic of Ireland, they are not, instead they are classified as a &quot;social group&quot;.;[http://www.itmtrav.com/Legal-ResourcePack2.html ''Irish Travellers Movement:'' Traveller Legal Resource Pack 2 - Traveller Culture];

Ireland, as of 2007, contains the fastest growing population in Europe. The growth rate in 2006 was 2.5%, the third year in a row it has been above 2%. This rapid growth can be said to be due to falling death rates, rising birth rates and high immigration rates. ;[http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/mheykfauqlmh/ BreakingNews.ie - ''Ireland's population still fastest-growing in EU''];

= Languages=
The official languages are Irish and English. Teaching of the Irish and English languages is compulsory in the primary and secondary level schools that receive money and recognition from the state. Some students may be exempt from the requirement to receive instruction in either language. English is by far the predominant language spoken throughout the country. People living in predominantly Irish-speaking communities, Gaeltacht regions, are limited to the low tens of thousands in isolated pockets largely on the western seaboard. Road signs are usually bilingual, except in Gaeltacht regions, where they are in Irish only. The legal status of place names has recently been the subject of controversy, with an order made in 2005 under the Official Languages Act changing the official name of certain locations from English back to Irish (e.g. Dingle had its name changed to ''An Daingean'', but was then renamed to &quot;Dingle Daingean Ui Chuis&quot;), sometimes despite local opposition, and, in Dingle's case, a plebiscite requesting a name change to a bilingual version. Most public notices are only in English, as are most of the print media. Most Government publications and forms are available in both English and Irish, and citizens have the right to deal with the state in Irish if they so wish.National media in Irish exist on TV (TG4), radio (e.g. Raidió na Gaeltachta), and in print (e.g. Lá Nua and Foinse).

According to the 2006 census, 1,656,790 people (or 39%) in the Republic regard themselves as competent in Irish; though no figures are available for English-speakers, it is thought to be almost 100%.

The Polish language is one of the most widely-spoken languages in Ireland after English and Irish: there are over 63,000 Poles resident in Ireland according to the 2006 census. Other languages spoken in Ireland include Shelta, spoken by the Irish Traveller population anda dialect of Scots is spoken by the descendents of Ulster-Scots|Scottish settlers in Ulster. 

Most students at second level choose one or two foreign languages to learn. Languages available for the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate include French, German, Italian and Spanish; Leaving Certificate students can also study Arabic, Japanese and Russian. Some schools also offer Ancient Greek, Hebrew Studies and Latin at second level.

=Recent population growth=
Ireland's population has increased greatly in recent years.Much of this population growth can be attributed to the arrival of immigrants and the return of Irish people (often with their foreign-born children) who emigrated in large numbers in earlier years during periods of high unemployment. However, birth rates in Ireland are currently over double the death rates, which is highly unusual among Western European countries, and the nation seems to be in the midst of a baby boom.;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/boom-in-births-as-new-arrivals-double-on-death-rates-1048773.html Irish Independent - Boom in births as new arrivals double on death rates]; Approximately 10% of Ireland's population is now made up of foreign citizens.
Non-national groups with populations in Ireland of 10,000 or more in 2006. Non-European Union nationals are shown exploded.
The CSO has published preliminary findings based on the 2006 Census of Population. These indicate:
* The total population of Ireland on Census Day, April 23 2006, was 4,234,925, an increase of 317,722, or 8.1% since 2002
*Allowing for the incidence of births (245,000) and deaths (114,000), the derived net immigration of people to Ireland between 2002 and 2006 was 186,000. 
*The total number of non-nationals (foreign citizens) resident in Ireland is 419,733, or around 10% (plus 1,318 people with 'no nationality' and 44,279 people whose nationality is not stated).
*The single largest group of immigrants comes from the United Kingdom (112,548) followed by Poland (63,267), Lithuania (24,628), Nigeria (16,300), Latvia (13,319), the United States (12,475), China (11,161), and Germany (10,289).
*94.8% of the population was recorded as having a 'White' ethnic or cultural background.1.1% of the population had a 'Black or Black Irish' background, 1.3% had an 'Asian or Asian Irish' background and 1.7% of the population's ethnic or cultural background was 'not stated'.
*The average annual rate of increase, 2%, is the highest on record – compared to 1.3% between 1996 and 2002 and 1.5% between 1971 and 1979.
*The 2006 population was last exceeded in the 1861 Census when the population then was 4.4 million The lowest population of Ireland was recorded in the 1961 Census – 2.6 million.
*All provinces of Ireland recorded population growth. The population of Leinster grew by 8.9%; Munster by 6.5%; and the long-term population decline of the Connacht-Ulster;Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan only.Remaining Ulster counties are in Northern Ireland; Region has stopped.
* The ratio of males to females has declined in each of the four provinces between 1979 and 2006. Leinster is the only province where the number of females exceeds the number of males. Males predominate in rural counties such as Cavan, Leitrim, and Roscommon while there are more females in cities and urban areas.

A more detailed breakdown of these figures is available online. 

Detailed statistics into the population of Ireland since 1841 are available at Irish Population Analysis.

Religion
A pie chart showing the proportion of followers of each religion (and none) in Ireland in 2006.
St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, the National Cathedral of the Church of Ireland (part of the Anglican Communion).
The Republic of Ireland is 86.8% Roman Catholic,;; and has one of the highest rates of regular and weekly church attendance in the Western World.;[http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/international.htm Weekly Mass Attendance of Catholics in Nations with Large Catholic Populations, 1980-2000] - World Values Survey (WVS); However, there has been a major decline in this attendance among Irish Catholics in the course of the past 30 years. Between 1996 and 2001, regular Mass attendance, declined further from 60% to 48%;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=44521 Irish Mass attendance below 50%] - Catholic World News June 1, 2006; (it had been above 90% before 1973), and all but two of its sacerdotal seminaries have closed (St Patrick's College, Maynooth and St Malachy's College, Belfast). A number of theological colleges continue to educate both ordained and lay people. 

The second largest Christian denomination, the Church of Ireland (Anglican), having been declining in number for most of the twentieth century, but has more recently experienced an increase in membership, according to the 2002 census, as have other small Christian denominations, and Hinduism.The largest other Protestant denominations are the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, followed by the Methodist Church in Ireland. The very small Jewish community in the state also recorded a marginal increase (see History of the Jews in Ireland) in the same period.

The patron saints of Ireland are Saint Patrick and Saint Bridget.

According to the 2006 census, the number of people who described themselves as having &quot;no religion&quot; was 186,318 (4.4%). An additional 1,515 people described themselves as agnostic and 929 as atheist instead of ticking the &quot;no religion&quot; box. This brings the total nonreligious within the state to 4.5% of the population. A further 70,322 (1.7%) did not state a religion.;[http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf Final Principal Demographic Results 2006];

=Religion and politics=
The 1937 Constitution of Ireland gave the Catholic Church a &quot;special position&quot; as the church of the majority, but also recognised other Christian denominations and Judaism.As with other predominantly Catholic European states (e.g., Italy), the Irish state underwent a period of legal secularisation in the late twentieth century.In 1972, the articles mentioning specific religious groups, including the Catholic Church were deleted from the Irish constitution by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland.

Article 44 remains in the Constitution. It begins:
:''The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God. It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.''
The article also establishes freedom of religion (for belief, practice, and organisation without undue interference from the state), prohibits endowment of any particular religion, prohibits the state from religious discrimination, and requires the state to treat religious and non-religious schools in a non-prejudicial manner.

Catholic doctrine prohibits abortion in all circumstances, putting it in conflict with the pro-choice movement.In 1983, the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland recognised &quot;the right to life of the unborn&quot;, subject to qualifications concerning the &quot;equal right to life&quot; of the mother.The case of ''Attorney General v. X'' prompted passage of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, guaranteeing the right to travel abroad to have an abortion performed, and the right of citizens to learn about &quot;services&quot; that are illegal in Ireland but legal outside the country (see Abortion in Ireland).

Catholic and Protestant attitudes in 1937 also disapproved of divorce, which was prohibited by the original Constitution.It was not until 1995 that the Fifteenth Amendment repealed this ban.

The Catholic Church was hit in the 1990s by a series of sexual abuse scandals and cover-up charges against its hierarchy. In 2005, a major inquiry was made into child sexual abuse allegations. The Ferns report, published on 25 October, 2005, revealed that more than 100 cases of child sexual abuse, between 1962 and 2002, by 21 priests, had taken place in the Diocese of Ferns alone. The report criticised the Garda Síochána|Gardaí and the health authorities, who failed to protect the children to the best of their abilities; and in the case of the Garda before 1988, no file was ever recorded on sexual abuse complaints (see Roman Catholic sex abuse cases).

Despite most schools in Ireland being run by religious organisations, a general trend of secularism is occurring within the Irish population, particularly in the younger generations. Many efforts have been made by secular groups, to eliminate the rigorous study in the first and sixth classes, to prepare for the sacraments of Holy Communion and confirmation. However religious studies as a subject was introduced into the state administered &quot;Junior certificate&quot; in 2001.

In the past, Ireland has historically favoured conservative legislation regarding sexuality. For example, contraception was illegal in Ireland until 1979.;; Another example is the legislation which outlawed homosexual acts was not repealed until 1993 although it was generally only enforced when dealing with underage sex.;;;Though Senator David Norris took his successful case to the European Court of Human Rights in 1988, the Irish Government did not legislate to rectify the issue until 1993.; However, Ireland has taken steps to grant equal rights for its gay citizens.

Culture


The island of Ireland has produced the Book of Kells, and writers such as George Berkeley, Sheridan le Fanu, Jonathan Swift, James Joyce, George Bernard Shaw, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Oliver Goldsmith, Oscar Wilde, W.B. Yeats, Patrick Kavanagh, Samuel Beckett, John Millington Synge, Seán O'Casey, Seamus Heaney, Bram Stoker, Elizabeth Bowen, Kate O'Brien, Seán Ó Faoláin, Frank O'Connor, William Trevor and others. Shaw, Yeats, Beckett and Heaney are Nobel Literature laureates. Other prominent writers include John Banville, Roddy Doyle, Pádraic Ó Conaire, Máirtín Ó Cadhain, Séamus Ó Grianna, Dermot Bolger, Maeve Binchy, Frank McCourt, Edna O'Brien, Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill,Paul Muldoon, Thomas McCarthy, Joseph O'Connor, John McGahern and Colm Tóibín.

The flourishing Irish film industry, state-supported by Bord Scannán na hÉireann, helped launched the careers of directors Neil Jordan and Jim Sheridan, and supported Irish films such as John Crowley's ''Intermission'', Neil Jordan's ''Breakfast on Pluto'', and others. A policy of tax breaks and other incentives has also attracted international film to Ireland, including Mel Gibson's ''Braveheart'', Steven Spielberg's ''Saving Private Ryan''.

Sport

In motorsport, during the 1990s Jordan Grand Prix became the only independent team to win multiple Formula One races. Rallying also has a measure of popularity as a spectator sport, and in 2007 the Rally of Ireland (which was held in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland) became a qualifying round of the FIA World Rally Championship and attracted an estimated attendance of some 200,000 spectators.;Jerry Williams, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/motorsport.html?in_article_id=494126&amp;in_page_id=1954 Fans unite as top drivers battle it out], Daily Mail, 14th November 2007;

Transport
LUAS

The Republic of Ireland has three main international airports (Dublin, Shannon, and Cork) that serve a wide variety of European and intercontinental routes with scheduled and chartered flights. The national airline is Aer Lingus, although low cost airline Ryanair is the largest airline. The route between London and Dublin is the busiest international air route in Europe, with 4.5 million people flying between the two cities in 2006.;Seán McCárthaigh, [http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2003/03/31/story437213650.asp Dublin–London busiest air traffic route within EU], ''Irish Examiner'', March 31, 2003;;;

Railways services are provided by Iarnród Éireann. Dublin is the centre of the network, with two main stations (Heuston and Connolly) linking to the main towns and cities. The Enterprise service, run jointly with Northern Ireland Railways connects Dublin with Belfast. Dublin has a steadily improving public transport network of varying quality including the DART, LUAS, Bus service and an expanding rail network.

The motorways and major trunk roads are managed by the National Roads Authority. The rest of the road network is managed by the local authorities in each of their areas. 

Regular ferry services operate between the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain, the Isle of Man and France.
