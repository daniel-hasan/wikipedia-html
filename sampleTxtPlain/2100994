The Headbangers were the tag team of Mosh and Thrasher, whose most notable matches were in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). As the name of the team implied, their gimmick was that they were a pair of headbangers, complete with heavy metal related T-shirts, piercings, shaved heads, and black face paint.

History
=1996-1998=
The team debuted on WWF television wearing nuns' clothing and billed as the Flying Nuns, Sister Angelica and Mother Smucker. On an episode of ''Shotgun Saturday Night'', Brother Love showed up to manage the Nuns. After the Nuns defeated the The Godwinns, Love renamed them the Sisters of Love.;; The gimmick was short-lived, but they kept the skirts when they became The Headbangers in January 1997.;;; They later had T-shirts with the phrase &quot;Real men wear skirts&quot; and occasionally wore sports bras over their shirts.;; The duo often carried a boombox to the ring, and on one occasion, Mosh vomited during an interview.; 

Throughout 1997, The Headbangers feuded with The Godwinns, as well as Doug Furnas &amp; Phil Lafon, often finding themselves on the losing end. They faced Legion of Doom during their surprise return match on February 24 to a double Professional wrestling#Countout|count-out.

The Headbangers were both meant to compete in the 1999 Royal Rumble but were injured before the event. Consequently, they were used sparingly throughout 1999. Mosh, repackaged as Beaver Cleavage and then Chaz, performed in singles competition and began having problems with his on-screen girlfriend, Marianna Komlos.; He was kayfabe arrested on an episode of ''Sunday Night Heat'' in September after Komlos claimed he hit her.;; After Chaz's match on October 5, Glen Ruth (Thrasher) showed GTV footage of Mariana applying makeup to create the effect of wounds.;;; This proved her accusations false, and The Headbangers subsequently reunited. They then took on a gimmick where they dressed as the opponents that they feuded with, such as the Dudley Boyz and Mean Street Posse. The duo later turned heel and began to dress in drag, most notably wearing breast cones.

Mosh entered in the 2000 Royal Rumble alone;;; however, The Headbangers continued performing in tag team and singles matches.;; Both men participated in the Hardcore battle royal at WrestleMania 2000 where Thrasher held the title for 43 seconds.;;;; The team continued battling the likes of Too Cool and T &amp; A (professional wrestling)|T &amp; A until mid 2000.; They then separated and formed other tag teams; Mosh joined D'Lo Brown as Chaz to form 'Lo Down.;;
