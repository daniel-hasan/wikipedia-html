Taunton is a city in Bristol County, Massachusetts,United States. It is theseat of Bristol County and the hub of the Greater Taunton Area. As of the 2000 census, the city had a total population of 55,976.

Taunton's nicknames are derived from its history. The moniker ''Silver City'' is born of Taunton's industrial past when companies such as F. B. Rogers Silver Co.|F. B. Rogers/International Silver Co. as well as Poole Silver and Reed &amp; Barton produced silver goods throughout the city. ''Christmas City'' is still evident each December with Christmas celebrations on the Taunton Green. The name Taunton means &quot;town (or city) on the River Tone&quot; or &quot;Tone Town&quot;, which refers to the geographical positioning of the original Taunton, UK.

History
Taunton was founded in 1637 by Elizabeth Pole, and officially incorporated as a town on September 3 1639. Most of the town's settlers were originally from Taunton, Somerset, England, which led early settlers to name the settlement after that town. At the time of Taunton's incorporation, they explained their choice of name as being, ''in honor and love to our dear native country... and owning it a great mercy of God to bring us to this place, and settling of us, on lands of our own bought with our money in peace, in the midst of the heathen, for a possession for ourselves and for our posterity after us.'' Prior to 1640, the Taunton area was called Cohannet. 

Mayflower Hill Cemetery
The British founders of Taunton took possession of the land from the native Wampanoags. The Taunton area was the site of battles (on its soil or the surrounding area) during various conflicts, including King Philip's War and the American Revolution. Taunton was re-incorporated as a city on May 11 1864.

Once a great industrial city, the &quot;Silver City&quot; was home to many silversmithing operations, including the Taunton Silversmiths, Reed &amp; Barton, Poole Silver, and the F. B. Rogers Silver Co.|F. B. Rogers Silver Co./International Silver Co.Various other industries operated throughout the city into the third quarter of the 20th century.

In October 2005, the nearby Whittenton Pond Dam threatened to fail following a week that brought nine inches of rain to the city. Over 2,000 city residents were evacuated;; and Mayor Robert Nunes issued a State of Emergency. It is estimated that if the dam had failed, the Mill River would have inundated the downtown area with up to six feet of water. In response, Governor Mitt Romney ordered an immediate inspection of high-risk dams throughout the Commonwealth.;;;;

Taunton once included many surrounding towns, including Norton, Easton, Mansfield, Dighton, Raynham, and Berkley.Possession of the latter is still noted by the naming of Taunton Hill in Assonet, which is now North Main Street, a street that heads into Berkley.

and has undergone several expansions and renovations since that time. Also of note is the Old Colony Historical Society, which archives the city and region's past.

The Taunton Green is the name of the city square. Early in its history, &quot;The Green&quot; was used as a training ground for militias in the American Revolution. Some say it was also the site of the historic &quot;Liberty &amp; Union&quot;/&quot;Taunton&quot; flag raising in 1774 by the Sons of Liberty, prior to the American Revolution.;; In the 20th and 21st century, the city square was temporarily transformed during the winter holiday season into a grand display of Christmas lights, scenes, and extravagant events. This is where and how the city earned its unofficial nickname in the surrounding areas as the &quot;Christmas City.&quot; 

&quot;The Green&quot; continues to provide a centralized location for city-wide Christmas activities, other holidays, events, and parades for the citizens of Taunton. A waterfall can sometimes be found at the center of the Taunton Green, although currently it is used only rarely, possibly to defray maintenance costs. 

Always to be seen flapping together in emblematic unison, the &quot;Liberty &amp; Union&quot; flag and the U.S. flag fly side-by-side on the flagpole at the city's center.

U.S. Highway 44|US 44, MA 138, and MA 140 intersect at a square at Taunton's center, which is called the Taunton Green. MA 140 is also accessible from the eastern neighborhood of the city, popularly referred to as &quot;East Taunton.&quot; Additionally, MA 24 and MA 140 intersect near East Taunton, and it is at that junction that Route 140 ceases to be a 2-lane divided freeway from the south and becomes a smaller state highway to the north. Interstate 495 runs through the northern portion of Taunton, unofficially referred to as &quot;North Taunton&quot;, and parallel to Myles Standish Industrial Park, Taunton's main industrial park.

Various smaller routes run through other parts of the city.

Taunton is the western terminus of MA 104. It merges into US 44 after entering the city.
