&quot;Hey Baby&quot; is a pop song written by Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, and Bounty Killer for No Doubt's fifth studio album ''Rock Steady'' (2001).The song is heavily influenced by the Jamaican dancehall music present at No Doubt's post-show parties and tour bus lounges of their ''Return of Saturn'' tour.;Its lyrics describe the debauchery with groupies at these parties.

The song received positive reviews from music critics, though the song's dancehall influences had a mixed reception.It was released as the album's lead single in October 2001 (see 2001 in music).The single was commercially successful and peaked at number five on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.At the 45th Grammy Awards, &quot;Hey Baby&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.
