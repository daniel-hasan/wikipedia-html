Gaius Julius Caesar (ca. 140 BC–85 BC) was a Roman senator, supporter and brother-in-law of Gaius Marius, and father of Julius Caesar, the later dictator of Rome.

Caesar was married to Aurelia Cotta, a member the of Aurelii and Rutilii families, and had two daughters, both named Julia, and a son, Julius Caesar, born in 100 BC.;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#9 9]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#74 74]; He was the brother of Sextus Julius Caesar, consul in 91 BC.;T.R.S. Broughton, ''Magistrates of the Roman Republic'', ii.20;

Caesar's progress through the ''cursus honorum'' is well known, although the specific dates associated with his offices are controversial. According to two ''elogiae'' erected in Rome long after his death, Caesar was a commissioner in the colony at Cercina, military tribune, quaestor, praetor, and proconsul of Asia.;Inscriptiones Italiae, 13.3.51-52; The dates of these offices are unclear.The colony is probably one of Marius' of 103 BC.;T.C. Brennan, ''The Praetorship in the Roman Republic'', 555.; Broughton dated the praetorship to 92 BC, with the quaestorship falling towards the beginning of the 90s.; Broughton, ''Magistrates'', ii. 17; Brennan has dated the praetorship to the beginning of the decade.;Brennan, ''Praetorship'', 555;

Caesar died suddenly in 85 BC, in Rome, while putting on his shoes one morning. Another Caesar, possibly his Gaius Julius Caesar#Gaius_Julius_Caesar_II|father, had died similarly in Pisa.;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.54 7.54]; His son, Julius Caesar, survived. His father had seen to his education by one of the best orators of Rome, Marcus Antonius Gnipho.;Suetonius, ''Lives of Eminent Grammarians'' s:Lives of Eminent Grammarians#7|7; In his will, he left Caesar the bulk of his estate, but after Marius's faction had been defeated in the civil war of the 80s BC, this inheritance was confiscated by the dictator Sulla.;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1];
