Plot
The game's setting takes place in the Lost Land, a primitive world inhabited by dinosaurs and other creatures. According to the game's instruction manual, Turok is a time-travelling warrior who ends up in the Lost Land.; The Campaigner is trying to gain the Chronoscepter weapon, and by using a focusing array to magnify the Chronoscepter's power, he plans to destroy the barriers that separate the ages of time and rule the universe.; Turok then vows to find the Chronoscepter himself, and sets off to put an end to his scheme. After battling through various areas of the Lost Land, including catacombs, a treetop village, a ruined city, and defeating bosses such as a fire-breathing ''Tyrannosaurus'', Turok ends up at The Campaigner's fortress, where he defeats him in single combat.

An interesting note about the storyline is that it is nearly non-existent out of the instruction manual, as there is no in-game dialogue and the player is only given the task of finding keys to open new areas in the opening cut scene, and not given the backstory.; Locate the hub ruins. Use the keys to open level portals. ; (''Turok: Dinosaur Hunter'');;

Development
Production of ''Dinosaur Hunter'' commenced in 1995, and while loosely based off the comic book, the developers, Iguana Entertainment, made the game much more action-oriented.;; An early idea during development was for it to be in a third-person perspective, similar to ''Super Mario 64'' and ''Tomb Raider'', but was decided against in order to keep the player immersed in the game's world.; Game producer and designer David Dienstbier stated that the Nintendo 64 was used due to its superior processing capabilities compared to the personal computers available at the time, and to showcase the console's graphical abilities, although it was later ported to the Windows platform.;

Originally slated for a holiday 1996 release, the game was delayed to 1997 in order to keep the quality high, and according to Nintendo, to &quot;add more depth to the gameplay.&quot;;; Even before it was made available to purchase, Acclaim announced that a sequel, tentatively titled ''Turok 2: Seeds of Evil|Turok: Dinosaur Hunter 2'', was to be released later that same year.;;

Reception
''Turoks distance fog keeps visibility to a small radius around the player. In this screenshot, a ''Velociraptor'' approaches while the player takes aim with a shotgun.
Worldwide sales of ''Dinosaur Hunter'' surpassed USD$60 million in late June of 1997.;; The game also held the top spot for video game rentals for seven weeks consecutively.;

''Turok: Dinosaur Hunter'' was well received at the time of its release, garnering an 85 out of possible 100 on Metacritic, or &quot;Generally favorable&quot;.;;Doug Perry of the multimedia website IGN awarded the game an 8.6 out of a possible 10. He said the game &quot;stands on the shoulders of all previous ''Doom'' games&quot;, and the gameplay takes the title to places &quot;''Doom'';';s never been&quot;.;; As the website GameSpot noted, the game &quot;mimics a hunting safari&quot; and like IGN, adds that it is &quot;more than just another Doom clone.&quot;;; 

Distance fog was used to keep the game's frame rate high. As GameSpot said, &quot;enemies beam to your location in a Star Trek fashion&quot;, but that the fog is a &quot;neat effect&quot; as enemies would appear out of the mist &quot;fangs first&quot;.; However, IGN commented that the player cannot look into the distance and rely upon the game's map to do so, although that this was a small exception to the graphical abilities.; ''Edge'' expressed that Iguana used &quot;every special effect imaginable&quot; when it created the environments, and awarded a 9 out of 10 score.; ''Edge'' also said that the game contradicts the notion at the time that only Nintendo could create superior titles for the console.;
