''Distinguished Artists'' is an intimate Canadian interview television series that focuses on all aspects of the arts with the goal of celebrating their guests' careers and achievements to inspire young artists.It profiles big names in music, comedy, drama, and literature.

Hosted by Emmy Award-nominated writer Lorne Frohman, this interview series is filmed at Assembly Hall, near Humber College Lakeshore Campus. It is written, produced and crewed by Humber College students for them to gain valuable set experience, mentorship by industry professionals and graduate with on-screen credits in key positions, allowing them to jump-start their careers.

The Humber School of Media Studies, Television: Writing and Producing program created, produced, wrote, shot and edited the series. Music students from the Humber School of Creative and Performing Arts wrote, arranged, and performed the series' theme song.

''Distinguished Artists'' is in fact the first network television show produced entirely by students of a college or university. It is produced by The Production League, a production company created by Executive Producer Brian Ainsworth and formed from the elite students of the Humber College Television Writing and Producing Program.Their proven successes to date include Distinguished Artists (5th season, over 80 episodes), School of Chef (1st season, 13 episodes completed), Earley Bird (currently in production), youWHO (currently in production) and they continue to enhance their reputation with every program produced.

The show airs on Canadian Learning Television (Saturdays at 6 p.m., 2 a.m.) and BookTelevision (Sundays at 10 a.m., 8 p.m., and 4 a.m.; Mondays 2 p.m., 11 p.m.).Starting in January 2008, Distinguished Artists will be syndicated nationally on a soon-to-be-announced network.
