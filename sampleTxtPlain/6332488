AVATAR MUD is a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon or Domain or Dimension) that's been in use since August of 1995. It is an online multi-player text-based computer game that combines elements of role-playing games, hack and slash style computer games and social instant messaging chat rooms.

Originally based on Merc/DikuMUD code, Avatar has been highly modified in the years since. Changes to areas, races, classes, equipment and other factors of gameplay have occurred, often resulting in player (dis)content. A loyal playerbase and strong staff (Immortals and Angels) have long seen the MUD remain stable, although player numbers have been decreasing over the past few years;[http://www.topmudsites.com/cgi-bin/reviews/robboard.cgi?action=display&amp;num=7385 TMS review] by the creator of Avatar, Snikt, confirming the player decrease.;.

Tiers

Characters may choose to start as ''newbies'' at either level 1 (where they start in Avatar's Mudschool) or level 2, and continue up the ranks by gaining experience points, and ''levelling'', or reaching the next level. The first tier comprises levels 1-50 and is called the 'low mortal' tier. The second tier starts at level 51 and is called the 'hero' tier. At this point, level 51, the player stops gaining regular levels, but gains sublevels. Because of this, a hero 750 character and a hero 11 character are both level 51. After 'hero' sublevel 500, the player has the option of morphing to a 'lord', which is level 125 (the hero tier stops at hero 999, after which further levels will automatically attempt to morph). After sublevel 500 of Lord, the player can become a Legend, which is level 250. This is the newest tier, and was added in late 2005, and the official planning;[http://www.mudconnect.com/mud-bin/prev/review.cgi?rid=22181 TMC review] by an Avatar staff member confirming some of the planning on the Legend tier.; is that this tier will be suited for PvP combat.

Classes and Races

When creating a character, players choose from a number of classes and races. Thus one may become an Orc Warrior, an Elf Cleric, a Human Rogue, or hundreds of other combinations (there are 25 creatable races; ; and 7 creatable classes; ;). There are additional classes and races available to more experienced players through a process called remorting; ;; ;, or choosing a prestige class; ;, and evolutionary race; ;. Play is enriched by class and race based spell and skill modifiers as well as racial skills and prerequisite skill/spell trees. The prestige class option, which is an extended version of your original class with a few unique skills added, becomes available at level 50, and allows users to change their class into a similar class, one that can be seen as a subschool of the so-called core class that they were before that.

Angels

Avatar is a newbie and family friendly MUD, where players from many nationalities and from a wide age range are made welcome.A special class of helpers has been implemented to teach and mentor, using personal experience with the game to help guide fellow players to become better mudders.

Immortals

Avatar has a team of dedicated Immortals who ensure the smooth running of the MUD and play many different roles. Immortals aid in the improvement of Avatar by suggesting or even writing new features. They edit, write and fix areas and also help maintain the website and extensive mailing list, note, channel and information systems and also run unique quests rather than rely on impersonal auto-quest systems. Player participation is actively encouraged in regular Quests run by both players and Immortal staff.

There is a hierarchy within Immortal ranks, with the Implementor, Snikt, being the final arbiter.


Avatar has a specially designed Mudschool to assist new players.
