The SR N Class were 2-6-0 (mogul) steam locomotives designed by Richard Maunsell for mixed-traffic duties on initially the SECR , and latterly the Southern Railway.A highly standardised class of locomotive, the N Class had a long period of conception upon the interruption of the First World War in 1914, only being introduced in 1917, three years after the original design.

Several members of the class were manfactures as kits of parts at the Woolwich Arsenal, with these being granted the nickname 'Woolworths.'Able to operate over most of the Southern Railway network after grouping in 1923,the N Class survived until 1966, when all had been withdrawn from service.Only a single example has been preserved.

Background

The class was a respone to the South Eastern and Chatham Railway's requirement for a sturdy mixed-traffic locomotive with high route availability on its network.;The design was to act as a replacement for elderly classes that were still present in this railway's running fleet, resulting in a requirement for standardization and ease of maintenance.;This had to be married to the ability for the new locomotive to operate over the lightly laid trackwork on the SECR, and as a result, the 2-6-0 wheel arrangement was settled upon.;The design was to have mass production in mind, and the result was the two-cylinder N Class.;Middlemass, Tom: 'The 'Woolworths' — Woolwich Arsenal's tentative entry into main line locomotive building' (''Backtrack'': 4, 148-54);

Construction history

Designed in 1914 by Richard Maunsell as a modern solution to the problems the SECR experienced with ageing and unspectacular mixed traffic designs, the N Class' production was delayed by the outbreak of the First World War.;Haresnape, Brian: ''Maunsell Locomotives - a pictorial history'' (Ian Allan Ltd, 1977), ISBN 0-7110-0743-8; 

Production finally began towards the end of the war with number 810 emerging from Ashford works in July 1917.;The new locomotive showed a heavy Swindon influence, as GWR engineer Harry Holcroft had been recruited by the SECR as Maunsell's assistant.The locomotives were superheated and were equipped with Walschaerts valve gear.;Haresnape, Brian: ''Maunsell Locomotives - a pictorial history'' (Ian Allan Ltd, 1977), ISBN 0-7110-0743-8;

Standardization of the SECR's locomotive fleet was a key consideration due to the various mismatched classes already under that railway's control providing unnecessary burden on its financial resources.; Herring, Peter: ''Classic British Steam Locomotives'' (Abbeydale Press: London, 2000) Section &quot;U Class&quot; ISBN 1861470576 Pages 120&amp;ndash;121;Effective standardisation of locomotive parts meant that the design was successful when trialled, and the Ministry of Supply ordered several of the class to be constructed at Woolwich Arsenal after the war, earning the locomotive the nickname &quot;Woolworths.&quot;;

The British government's interest in the standardisation potential of the N Class stemmed from an early attempt to nationalise the railways, although this idea was soon abandoned in favour of grouping the railways into the &quot;Big Four&quot; from 1923.;

The ease of construction through the manufacturing of prefabricated components at Woolwich meant that many were available for purchase at the time of Grouping, and several were sold to Ireland and the Metropolitan Railway.;The class was readily adopted by the newly formed Southern Railway, with 50 members being assembled at Ashford.; Reynolds, W.J.: The Maunsell moguls (''S.R. Railway Magazine'', 1943, 89), PPs. 155&amp;ndash;8; 199&amp;ndash;202; 279&amp;ndash;82;The first 65 of the class constructed were equipped with the standard right hand drive characteristic of Ashford works.The success of the design, however, spawned the infamous SECR K Class 2-6-4Ts which used the front end and boiler of the N design.;

= The final batch=

The final batch of 15 locomotives were constructed between 1932 and 1934.These had various detail differences to the &quot;Woolworth&quot; batches, the major alteration being the adaptation of the design to encompass the Southern's adopted left-hand drive standard.;

Further detail differences were the implementation of U1 Class components, such as the dome and chimney, which were of a lower profile than the original N design.;These locomotives were also equipped with 4,000 gallon tenders, and sported a step on the footplate, the area of the boiler backplate being lower than that of the tender fall-plate.;Haresnape, Brian: ''Maunsell Locomotives - a pictorial history'' (Ian Allan Ltd, 1977), ISBN 0-7110-0743-8;

= Further modifications=

From 1933, the entire class was supplied with smoke deflectors, and although originally equipped with smokebox-mounted snifting valves, these were removed by the end of the Second World War.;The batch constructed after 1930 were also equipped with front steps when built, those built prior to these did not encompass this refinement until later on in their careers.;Haresnape, Brian: ''Maunsell Locomotives - a pictorial history'' (Ian Allan Ltd, 1977), ISBN 0-7110-0743-8;

Livery and numbering
= SECR and Southern Railway=

When grouping occurred in 1923, the liveries sported by the constituent companies were standardised.;The N Class was initially outshopped in Urie LSWR Green, and ran in this guise throughout the 1920s, with yellow numbering and 'Southern' on the tender.From 1931, the class was repainted in Maunsell lined SR Olive Green after 1931, once again with yellow markings.;Haresnape, Brian: ''Maunsell Locomotives - a pictorial history'' (Ian Allan Ltd, 1977), ISBN 0-7110-0743-8;

Upon the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, locomotive numbers 1413 &amp; 1850 were painted Olive Green with no lining due to the inevitable cutbacks on labour.; Others were outshopped in wartime black when their overhauls became due.;Haresnape, Brian: ''Maunsell Locomotives - a pictorial history'' (Ian Allan Ltd, 1977), ISBN 0-7110-0743-8;However, some of the locomotives (numbers 1821/25/47/78 &amp; 1403) had, by 1941 acquired a new Maunsell Green livery, though received the new Bulleid gilt lettering; these were also unlined due to wartime constraints.;All Ns had been painted black by the end of the war.;Haresnape, Brian: ''Maunsell Locomotives - a pictorial history'' (Ian Allan Ltd, 1977), ISBN 0-7110-0743-8;
 
Two locomotives, numbers 1817 &amp; 1854, received Bulleid's Malachite Green livery in 1946 with yellow and black lining and &quot;Sunshine Yellow&quot; lettering replacing the gilt.;Haresnape, Brian: ''Maunsell Locomotives - a pictorial history'' (Ian Allan Ltd, 1977), ISBN 0-7110-0743-8;Numbering was also a highly complex issue, a reflection of the initial slow pace of production.;Ashford works had constructed a mere 15 locomotives numbered from 810&amp;ndash;824 by December 1923, which were numbered under SECR parlance.;The Woolwich Arsenal batch of 50 locomotives purchased by the newly formed Southern Railway from 1923 were numbered from A825&amp;ndash;A875.;Haresnape, Brian: ''Maunsell Locomotives - a pictorial history'' (Ian Allan Ltd, 1977), ISBN 0-7110-0743-8; 

The letter 'A' reflected the post grouping practice of the Southern to denote the engine's place of origin within the pre-grouping (SECR in this case) number.;This helped to prevent confusion with locomotives of similar numbers also acquired from other pre-grouping railway companies.The 'A' in this case denotes Ashford, where the Woolwich batch was assembled from a series of kits.Southern numbering policy was eventually rationalised, and from 1928, the locomotives were renumbered 1810 to 1875.;Haresnape, Brian: ''Maunsell Locomotives - a pictorial history'' (Ian Allan Ltd, 1977), ISBN 0-7110-0743-8;The final batch of 15 locomotives built between 1932 and 1934 were numbered 1400&amp;ndash;1414 without the 'A' prefix.

=Post-1948 (nationalisation)=

The class was absorbed by British Railways in 1948, and were given the BR Power classification 4P5F.Livery was initially as Southern Railway, though with 'British Railways' on the tender, and an 'S' prefix to the Southern number.This was succeeded by the BR mixed traffic lined black livery with red and white lining, and the BR crest on the tender.; Longworth, Hugh: ''British Railway Steam Locomotives: 1948-1968'' (Oxford Publishing Company: Oxford, 2005) ISBN 0860935930;Numbering was under the BR standard system, and were allocated the series 31810&amp;ndash;31875 for the earlier locomotives, and 31400&amp;ndash;31414 for the final 15.;Ian Allan ABC of British Railways Locomotives, winter 1958&amp;ndash;59 edition;

Operational details and preservation

image:31874 as &quot;James&quot; from TTTE.jpg|thumb|left|Preserved N Class 31827 masquerading as Thomas the Tank Engine's &quot;James&quot; on the Mid-Hants Railway, 2005 The N Class proved to be an ideal workhorse equally adept at undertaking passenger of freight traffic, from semi fast passenger duties to pick-up goods.;NºA866 was put on display at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley from May to November 1925, as Southern Railway Nº866.;Locomotive number 822 was built as the prototype three cylindered version to be known as the N1 class.;The N Class was subjected to many trials, with number 1850 being fitted with J. T. Marshall valve gear in 1933&amp;ndash;34.;Haresnape, Brian: ''Maunsell Locomotives - a pictorial history'' (Ian Allan Ltd, 1977), ISBN 0-7110-0743-8;This was a shorth lived trial, as it was soon reverted to standard Walschaerts gear.

Prior to nationalisation, Government-backed locomotive fuelling trials meant that 1831 was converted to oil burning during 1947 and converted back in 1948.;Haresnape, Brian: ''Maunsell Locomotives - a pictorial history'' (Ian Allan Ltd, 1977), ISBN 0-7110-0743-8;Their heavy usage began to show, as from 1955 until 1961, 29 of the class had to be re-cylindered due to wear. Frames were occasionally replaced but generally, only had the front end was re-conditioned, where outside steampipes were fitted to the new cylinders.;Another source of operational miscellany was that from 1957, some of the class began to receive BR Standard Class 4 chimneys, one such example being number 31412.; Longworth, Hugh: ''British Railway Steam Locomotives: 1948-1968'' (Oxford Publishing Company: Oxford, 2005) ISBN 0860935930;

The N class was a robust, reliable locomotive design that eventually saw use throughout the Southern network.;They had high capacity, tapered boilers that enabled free steaming, and small coupled wheels that delivered considerable tractive effort ensured that the class performed well when hauling heavy loads during the Second World War.;Haresnape, Brian: ''Maunsell Locomotives - a pictorial history'' (Ian Allan Ltd, 1977), ISBN 0-7110-0743-8;Their high route availability when undertaking this role meant that the class migrated from the SR Eastern section to work additionally on the Central and Western sections, and in their BR (Southern Region) days continued to perform well on passenger and goods duties in the West Country.;Casserley, H.C.: 'End of the Maunsell moguls—the Southern maids-of-all-work' (''Railway World'': 1966, 27), pps. 436&amp;ndash;40);Withdrawals occurred between 1962 to 1966, and only a single member of the class has been preserved, BR number 31827, and after many years' service is in store on the Mid-Hants Railway pending overhaul.;
