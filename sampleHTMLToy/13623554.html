<p>As a young man studying <a href="/wiki/Medicine" id="w">medicine</a>, Guevara travelled rough throughout <a href="/wiki/South_America" id="w">South America</a>, bringing him into direct contact with the impoverished conditions in which many people lived.

<p>Guevara learned <a href="/wiki/Chess" id="w">chess</a> from his father and began participating in local tournaments by the age of 12.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> During his adolescence, he became passionate about poetry, especially that of <a href="/wiki/Pablo_Neruda" id="w">Pablo Neruda</a>. Guevara, as is common practice among Latin Americans of his class, also wrote poems throughout his life. He was an enthusiastic and eclectic reader, with interests ranging from adventure classics by <a href="/wiki/Jack_London" id="w">Jack London</a>, <a href="/wiki/Emilio_Salgari" id="w">Emilio Salgari</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jules_Verne" id="w">Jules Verne</a> to essays on <a href="/wiki/Human_sexuality" id="w">sexuality</a> by <a href="/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" id="w">Sigmund Freud</a> and treatises on social philosophy by <a href="/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" id="w">Bertrand Russell</a>. In his late teens, he developed a keen interest in photography and spent many hours photographing people, places and, during later travels, <a href="/wiki/Archeology" id="w">archaeological</a> sites.</p>
<p>In 1948  Guevara entered the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Buenos_Aires" id="w">University of Buenos Aires</a> to study medicine. As a student, he spent long periods traveling around <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" id="w">Latin America</a>. In 1951 his older friend, <a href="/wiki/Alberto_Granado" id="w">Alberto Granado</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Biochemistry" id="w">biochemist</a>, suggested that Guevara take a year off from his medical studies to embark on a trip they had talked of making for years, traversing <a href="/wiki/South_America" id="w">South America</a>. Guevara and the 29-year-old Granado soon set off from their hometown of <a href="/wiki/Alta_Gracia" id="w">Alta Gracia</a> astride a 1939 <a href="/wiki/Norton_(motorcycle)" id="w">Norton</a> 500&#160;cc <a href="/wiki/Motorcycle" id="w">motorcycle</a> they named <i>La Poderosa II</i>&#160; (&#34;The Mighty One, the Second&#34;) with the idea of spending a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo <a href="/wiki/Leper_colony" id="w">Leper colony</a> in <a href="/wiki/Peru" id="w">Peru</a> on the banks of the <a href="/wiki/Amazon_River" id="w">Amazon River</a>. Guevara narrated this journey in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Motorcycle_Diaries" id="w">The Motorcycle Diaries</a></i>, which was translated into English in 1996 and used in 2004 as the basis for a <a href="/wiki/The_Motorcycle_Diaries_(film)" id="w">motion picture of the same name</a>, directed by <a href="/wiki/Walter_Salles" id="w">Walter Salles</a>.</p>
<p>Witnessing the widespread poverty, oppression and disenfranchisement throughout Latin America, and influenced by his readings of Marxist literature, Guevara decided that the only solution for the region’s inequalities was armed revolution. His travels and readings also led him to view Latin America not as a group of separate nations but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide strategy for liberation. His conception of a borderless, united <a href="/wiki/Ibero-America" id="w">Ibero-America</a> sharing a common &#39;<a href="/wiki/Mestizo" id="w">mestizo</a>&#39; culture{{cref}} was a theme that would prominently recur during his later revolutionary activities. Upon returning to Argentina, he expedited the completion of his medical studies, completed his education as a medic in order to resume his travels in <a href="/wiki/Central_America" id="w">Central</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_America" id="w">South America</a> and received his diploma on <a href="/wiki/12_June" id="w">12 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a>.{{cref}}</p>
<a id="Guatemala" name="Guatemala"></a><h1>Guatemala</h1>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/7_July" id="w">7 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a>, Guevara set out on a trip through <a href="/wiki/Bolivia" id="w">Bolivia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peru" id="w">Peru</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ecuador" id="w">Ecuador</a>, <a href="/wiki/Panama" id="w">Panama</a>, <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rica" id="w">Costa Rica</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicaragua" id="w">Nicaragua</a>, <a href="/wiki/Honduras" id="w">Honduras</a>, and <a href="/wiki/El_Salvador" id="w">El Salvador</a>.

In a contemporaneous letter to his Aunt Beatriz, Guevara explained his motivation for settling down for a time in Guatemala: &#34;In Guatemala&#34;, he wrote, &#34;I will perfect myself and accomplish whatever may be necessary in order to become a true revolutionary.&#34;<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup><div style="wigth:250px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:250px-Che_Guevara_-_2do_Viaje_-_1953-55.png" title="A map showing Che Guevara&#39;s movements between 1953 and 1956; including his trip north to Guatemala, his stay in Mexico and his journey east by boat to Cuba with [[Fidel Castro]] and other revolutionaries."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/250px-Che_Guevara_-_2do_Viaje_-_1953-55.png" alt="A map showing Che Guevara&#39;s movements between 1953 and 1956; including his trip north to Guatemala, his stay in Mexico and his journey east by boat to Cuba with [[Fidel Castro]] and other revolutionaries." title="A map showing Che Guevara&#39;s movements between 1953 and 1956; including his trip north to Guatemala, his stay in Mexico and his journey east by boat to Cuba with [[Fidel Castro]] and other revolutionaries." class="location-none type-thumb" width="250px" />

</p>
<p>Shortly after reaching Guatemala City, Guevara acted upon the suggestion of a mutual friend that he seek out Hilda Gadea Acosta, a Peruvian economist who was living and working there. Gadea, whom he would later marry, was well-connected politically as a result of her membership in the socialist <a href="/wiki/American_Popular_Revolutionary_Alliance" id="w">American Popular Revolutionary Alliance</a> (APRA) led by <a href="/wiki/V%C3%ADctor_Ra%C3%BAl_Haya_de_la_Torre" id="w">Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre</a>, and she introduced Guevara to a number of high-level officials in the Arbenz government. He also re-established contact with a group of Cuban exiles linked to <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" id="w">Fidel Castro</a> whom he had initially met in Costa Rica; among them was Antonio &#34;Ñico&#34; López, associated with the attack on the &#34;Carlos Manuel de Céspedes&#34; barracks in <a href="/wiki/Bayamo" id="w">Bayamo</a> in the Cuban province of Oriente,<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> and who would die at Ojo del Toro bridge soon after the <i><a href="/wiki/Granma_(yacht)" id="w">Granma</a></i> landed in Cuba.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Guevara joined these &#34;<a href="/wiki/Moncada_Barracks" id="w">moncadistas</a>&#34; in the sale of religious objects related to the <a href="/wiki/Christ#Race of Christ" id="w">Black Christ</a> of <a href="/wiki/Esquipulas" id="w">Esquipulas</a>, and he also assisted two Venezuelan <a href="/wiki/Malaria" id="w">malaria</a> specialists at a local hospital. It was during this period that he acquired his famous nickname, &#34;Che&#34;, due to his frequent use of the Argentine <a href="/wiki/Interjection" id="w">interjection</a> <a href="/wiki/Che_(Spanish)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Che&#39;&#39;</a> ({{pronounced}}), which is used in much the same way as &#34;hey&#34;, &#34;pal&#34;, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Eh" id="w">eh</a>&#34;, or &#34;mate&#34; are employed colloquially in various English-speaking countries. <a href="/wiki/Argentina" id="w">Argentina</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uruguay" id="w">Uruguay</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paraguay" id="w">Paraguay</a>, and southern <a href="/wiki/Brazil" id="w">Brazil</a> (where the interjection is rendered &#39;tchê&#39; in written Portuguese) are the only areas where this <a href="/wiki/Expression" id="w">expression</a> is used, making it a trademark of the <a href="/wiki/R%C3%ADo_de_la_Plata" id="w">Rioplatense</a> region.</p>
<p>Guevara&#39;s attempts to obtain a medical internship were unsuccessful and his economic situation was often precarious, leading him to pawn some of Hilda&#39;s jewelry.<sup id="_ref-jewelry_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jewelry" title="">[15]</a></sup> He maintained a distance from any political organization, even though his political thinking at that time manifested a clear sympathy towards communism. Despite Guevara’s financial woes, he rejected an offer to work as a state medic when it transpired that he would have to affiliate himself with the <a href="/wiki/Guatemalan_Party_of_Labour" id="w">Communist Party of Guatemala</a>.<sup id="_ref-jewelry_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jewelry" title="">[15]</a></sup> Political events in the country began to move quickly after <a href="/wiki/May_15" id="w">May 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1954" id="w">1954</a> when a shipment of <a href="/wiki/Škoda_Works" id="w">Škoda</a> infantry and light artillery weapons sent from <a href="/wiki/Communist" id="w">Communist</a> <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia" id="w">Czechoslovakia</a> for the Arbenz Government arrived in <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Barrios" id="w">Puerto Barrios</a> aboard the <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Swedish</a> ship <i><a href="/wiki/Alfhem" id="w">Alfhem</a></i>. The amount of Czechoslovak weaponry was estimated to be 2000 tons by the CIA<sup id="_ref-usdepstate_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-usdepstate" title="">[16]</a></sup> though only 2 tons by Jon Lee Anderson.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Guevara briefly left Guatemala for El Salvador to pick up a new visa, then returned to Guatemala only a few days before the CIA-sponsored coup attempt led by <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Castillo_Armas" id="w">Carlos Castillo Armas</a> began.<sup id="_ref-usdepstate_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-usdepstate" title="">[16]</a></sup> The anti-Arbenz forces tried, but failed, to stop the trans-shipment of the Czechoslovak weapons by train. However, after pausing to regroup and recover energy, Castillo Armas&#39; column seized the initiative and, apparently with the assistance of US air support, started to gain ground.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> Guevara was eager to fight on behalf of Arbenz and joined an armed <a href="/wiki/Militia" id="w">militia</a> organized by the Communist Youth for that purpose; but, frustrated with the group&#39;s inaction, he soon returned to medical duties. Following the coup, he again volunteered to fight but his efforts were thwarted when Arbenz took refuge in the Mexican Embassy and told his foreign supporters to leave the country. After Gadea was arrested, Guevara sought protection inside the Argentine <a href="/wiki/Consulate" id="w">consulate</a> where he remained until he received a safe-conduct pass some weeks later. At that point, he turned down a free seat on a flight back to Argentina that was offered to him by the embassy, preferring instead to make his way to <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a>.</p>
<p>The overthrow of the Arbenz regime by a <a href="/wiki/Operation_PBSUCCESS" id="w">coup d&#39;état backed by the Central Intelligence Agency</a> cemented Guevara&#39;s view of the United States as an <a href="/wiki/Imperialism" id="w">imperialist</a> power that would implacably oppose and attempt to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries. This strengthened his conviction that socialism achieved through armed struggle and defended by an armed populace was the only way to rectify such conditions.</p>

<p>He was appointed commander of the <a href="/wiki/La_Caba%C3%B1a_Fortress" id="w">La Cabaña Fortress</a> prison, and during his five-month tenure in that post (<a href="/wiki/January_2" id="w">January 2</a> through <a href="/wiki/June_12" id="w">June 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1959" id="w">1959</a>),<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> he oversaw the trial and execution of many people, among whom were former Batista regime officials and members of the &#34;Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities&#34; (BRAC), a unit of the secret police known by its Spanish acronym. José Vilasuso, an attorney who worked under Guevara at <a href="/wiki/La_Caba%C3%B1a" id="w">La Cabaña</a> preparing indictments, said that these were lawless proceedings where &#34;the facts were judged without any consideration to general juridical principles&#34; and the findings were pre-determined by Guevara.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> It is estimated that between 156<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> and 550<sup id="_ref-skidmore_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-skidmore" title="">[35]</a></sup> people were executed on Guevara&#39;s extra-judicial orders during this time.<sup id="_ref-diffsourcexec_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-diffsourcexec" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Later, Guevara became an official at the National Institute of Agrarian Reform,{{cref}} and President of the National Bank of Cuba.{{cref}} He signed all <span class="image"><img alt="Cuban banknotes" rel="nofollow" src="http://www.banknotes.com/CU88.JPG" /></span> issued during his fourteen-month presidency with his nickname, &#34;Che&#34;.{{cref}} Throughout his time in the Cuban government, Guevara refused his due salaries of office, insisting on drawing only his meager wages as army <i>commandante</i> in order to set a &#34;revolutionary example&#34;.<sup id="_ref-anderson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anderson" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>During this time his fondness for <a href="/wiki/Chess" id="w">chess</a> was rekindled, and he attended and participated in most national and international tournaments held in Cuba.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> He was particularly eager to encourage young Cubans to take up the game, and organized various activities designed to stimulate their interest in it.</p>
<p>Even as early as 1959, Guevara helped organize revolutionary expeditions overseas, all of which failed. The first attempt was made in <a href="/wiki/Panama" id="w">Panama</a>; another in the <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" id="w">Dominican Republic</a> (led by Henry Fuerte,<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> also known as &#34;El Argelino&#34;, and Enrique Jiménez Moya)<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> took place on <a href="/wiki/14_June" id="w">14 June</a> of that same year.</p>
<p>In 1960 Guevara provided first aid to victims when the freighter <i><a href="/wiki/La_Coubre_explosion" id="w">La Coubre</a></i>, a French vessel carrying munitions from the port of Antwerp, exploded while it was being unloaded in Havana harbor. A rescue operation immediately ensued but went awry when a second explosion occurred, resulting in well over a hundred dead.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> It was at the memorial service for the victims of this explosion that <a href="/wiki/Alberto_Korda" id="w">Alberto Korda</a> took the most famous photograph of him.</p>
<p>Guevara later served as Minister of Industries,{{cref}} in which post he helped formulate Cuban <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialism</a>, and became one of the country&#39;s most prominent figures. In his book <i><a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_Warfare_(book)" id="w">Guerrilla Warfare</a></i>, he advocated replicating the Cuban model of revolution initiated by a small group (<i><a href="/wiki/Foco" id="w">foco</a></i>) of guerrillas without the need for broad organizations to precede armed insurrection. His essay <i>El socialismo y el hombre en Cuba</i> (1965) (<i>Man and Socialism in Cuba</i>) advocates the need to shape a &#34;new man&#34; (<i>hombre nuevo</i>) in conjunction with a socialist state. Some saw Guevara as the simultaneously glamorous and austere model of that &#34;new man.&#34;</p>
<p>During the 1961 <a href="/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion" id="w">Bay of Pigs Invasion</a>, Guevara did not participate in the fighting, having been ordered by Castro to a command post in Cuba&#39;s westernmost <a href="/wiki/Pinar_del_R%C3%ADo_Province" id="w">Pinar del Río province</a> where he was involved in fending off a decoy force. He did, however, suffer a bullet wound to the face during this deployment, which he said had been caused by the accidental discharge of his own gun.<sup id="_ref-anderson2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anderson2" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>Guevara played a key role in bringing to Cuba the Soviet nuclear-armed <a href="/wiki/Ballistic_missile" id="w">ballistic missiles</a> that precipitated the <a href="/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis" id="w">Cuban Missile Crisis</a> in October 1962. During an interview with the British newspaper <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Worker" id="w">Daily Worker</a></i> some weeks later, he stated that, if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them against major U.S. cities.<sup id="_ref-anderson3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anderson3" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

<p>Two weeks later, Guevara dropped out of public life and then vanished altogether. His whereabouts were the great mystery of 1965 in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself. His disappearance was variously attributed to the relative failure of the <a href="/wiki/Industrialization" id="w">industrialization</a> scheme he had advocated while minister of industry, to pressure exerted on Castro by Soviet officials disapproving of Guevara&#39;s pro-<a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China" id="w">Chinese Communist</a> bent as the <a href="/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split" id="w">Sino-Soviet split</a> grew more pronounced, and to serious differences between Guevara and the Cuban leadership regarding Cuba&#39;s economic development and ideological line.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>

<p>Pressed by international speculation regarding Guevara&#39;s fate, Castro stated on <a href="/wiki/16_June" id="w">16 June</a>, <a href="/wiki/1965" id="w">1965</a>, that the people would be informed about Guevara when Guevara himself wished to let them know. Numerous rumors about his disappearance spread both inside and outside Cuba. On <a href="/wiki/3_October" id="w">3 October</a> of that year, Castro revealed a hand written undated letter<sup id="_ref-farewell_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-farewell" title="">[55]</a></sup> purportedly written to him by Guevara some months earlier in which Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution but declared his intention to leave Cuba to fight abroad for the cause of the revolution. He explained that &#34;Other nations of the world summon my modest efforts,&#34; and that he had therefore decided to go and fight as a guerrilla &#34;on new battlefields&#34;. In the letter Guevara announced his resignation from all his positions in the government, in the party, and in the Army, and renounced his Cuban citizenship, which had been granted to him in 1959 in recognition of his efforts on behalf of the revolution.</p>
<p>During an interview with four foreign correspondents on <a href="/wiki/1_November" id="w">1 November</a>, Castro remarked that he knew where Guevara was but would not disclose his location, and added, denying reports that his former comrade-in-arms was dead, that &#34;he is in the best of health.&#34; Despite Castro&#39;s assurances, Guevara&#39;s fate remained a mystery at the end of 1965 and his movements and whereabouts continued to be a closely held secret for the next two years.</p>

<p>Although Guevara was thirty-seven at the time and had no formal military training, he had the experiences of the Cuban revolution, including his successful march on Santa Clara, which was central to Batista finally being overthrown by Castro&#39;s forces. His asthma had prevented him from being drafted into military service in Argentina, a fact of which he was proud given his opposition to <a href="/wiki/Juan_Per%C3%B3n" id="w">Perón&#39;s</a> government.</p>
<p>South African mercenaries including <a href="/wiki/Mike_Hoare" id="w">Mike Hoare</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuban</a> exiles worked with the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" id="w">Congolese</a> army to thwart Guevara. They were able to monitor his communications, arrange to ambush the rebels and the Cubans whenever they attempted to attack, and interdict his supply lines.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> Despite the fact that Guevara sought to conceal his presence in the Congo, the U.S. government was fully aware of his location and activities: The <a href="/wiki/National_Security_Agency" id="w">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) was intercepting all of his incoming and outgoing transmissions via equipment aboard the <i>USNS Valdez</i>, a floating listening post which continuously cruised the Indian Ocean off <a href="/wiki/Dar-es-Salaam" id="w">Dar-es-Salaam</a> for that purpose.{{cref}}</p>
<p>Guevara&#39;s aim was to export the Cuban Revolution by instructing local Simba fighters in communist ideology and <a href="/wiki/Foco" id="w">foco</a> strategies of <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare" id="w">guerrilla warfare</a>. In his <i>Congo Diary</i>, he cites the incompetence, intransigence, and infighting of the local Congolese forces as the key reasons for the revolt&#39;s failure.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> Later that same year, ill with dysentery, suffering from his asthma, and disheartened after seven months of frustrations, Guevara left the Congo with the Cuban survivors (six members of his column had died). At one point Guevara had considered sending the wounded back to Cuba, then standing alone and fighting until the end in the Congo as a revolutionary example; however, after being urged by his comrades in arms and pressured by two emissaries sent by Castro, at the last moment he reluctantly agreed to leave the Congo. A few weeks later, when writing the preface to the diary he had kept during the Congo venture, he began it with the words: &#34;This is the history of a failure.&#34;<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>

During this time he compiled his memoirs of the Congo experience, and wrote the drafts of two more books, one on philosophy<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> and the other on economics.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> He also visited several countries in Western Europe in order to &#34;test&#34; a new false identity and the corresponding documentation (passport, etc.) created for him by <a href="/wiki/DGI" id="w">Cuban Intelligence</a> that he planned to use to travel to South America. Throughout this period Castro continued to importune him to return to Cuba, but Guevara only agreed to do so when it was understood that he would be there on a strictly temporary basis for the few months needed to prepare a new revolutionary effort somewhere in Latin America, and that his presence on the island would be cloaked in the tightest secrecy.</p>

Speculation on Guevara&#39;s whereabouts continued throughout 1966 and into 1967. Representatives of the <a href="/wiki/Mozambique" id="w">Mozambican</a> independence movement <a href="/wiki/FRELIMO" id="w">FRELIMO</a> reported meeting with Guevara in late 1966 or early 1967 in <a href="/wiki/Dar_es_Salaam" id="w">Dar es Salaam</a>, at which point they rejected his offer of aid in their revolutionary project.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> In a speech at the 1967 <a href="/wiki/May_Day" id="w">May Day</a> rally in Havana, the Acting Minister of the armed forces, Major <a href="/wiki/Juan_Almeida" id="w">Juan Almeida</a>, announced that Guevara was &#34;serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America&#34;. The persistent reports that he was leading the guerrillas in Bolivia were eventually shown to be true.</p>
<p>At Castro&#39;s behest, a 3,700 acre parcel of jungle land in the remote Ñancahuazú region had been purchased by native Bolivian Communists for Guevara to use as a training area and base camp.{{cref}} The evidence suggests that the training at this camp in the Ñancahuazú valley was more hazardous than combat to Guevara and the Cubans accompanying him. Little was accomplished in the way of building a guerrilla army. Former <a href="/wiki/Stasi" id="w">Stasi</a> operative <a href="/wiki/Hayd%C3%A9e_Tamara_Bunke_Bider" id="w">Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider</a>, better known by her <i><a href="/wiki/Nom_de_guerre" id="w">nom de guerre</a></i> &#34;Tania&#34;, who had been installed as his primary agent in La Paz, was reportedly also working for the <a href="/wiki/KGB" id="w">KGB</a> and is widely inferred to have unwittingly served Soviet interests by leading Bolivian authorities to Guevara&#39;s trail.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> The numerous photographs taken by and of Guevara and other members of his guerrilla group that they left behind at their base camp after the initial clash with the Bolivian army in March 1967 provided President <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Barrientos" id="w">René Barrientos</a> with the first proof of his presence in Bolivia; after viewing them, Barrientos allegedly stated that he wanted Guevara&#39;s head displayed on a pike in downtown <a href="/wiki/La_Paz" id="w">La Paz</a>. He thereupon ordered the Bolivian Army to hunt Guevara and his followers down.</p>
<p>Guevara&#39;s guerrilla force, numbering about 50 and operating as the ELN (<i>Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Bolivia</i>; English: &#34;<a href="/wiki/National_Liberation_Army_of_Bolivia" id="w">National Liberation Army of Bolivia</a>&#34;), was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against Bolivian regulars in the difficult terrain of the mountainous Camiri region. In September, however, the Army managed to eliminate two guerrilla groups, reportedly killing one of the leaders.</p>
<p>Despite the violent nature of the conflict, Guevara gave medical attention to all of the wounded Bolivian soldiers whom the guerrillas took prisoner, and subsequently released them. Even after his last battle at the Quebrada del Yuro, in which he had been wounded, when he was taken to a temporary holding location and saw there a number of Bolivian soldiers who had also been wounded in the fighting, he offered to give them medical care. His offer was turned down by the Bolivian officer in charge.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>Guevara&#39;s plan for fomenting revolution in Bolivia appears to have been based upon a number of misconceptions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He had expected to deal only with the country&#39;s military government and its poorly trained and equipped army. However, after the U.S. government learned of his location, CIA and other operatives were sent into Bolivia to aid the anti-insurrection effort. The Bolivian Army was being trained and supplied by <a href="/wiki/U.S._Army_Special_Forces" id="w">U.S. Army Special Forces</a>{{cref}} advisors, including a recently organized elite battalion of <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers" id="w">Rangers</a> trained in <a href="/wiki/Jungle_warfare" id="w">jungle warfare</a> that set up camp in La Esperanza, a small settlement close to the guerrillas&#39; zone of operations.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup></li>
<li>Guevara had expected assistance and cooperation from the local dissidents. He did not receive it; and Bolivia&#39;s Communist Party, under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/Mario_Monje" id="w">Mario Monje</a>, was oriented towards Moscow rather than Havana and did not aid him, despite having promised to do so. Some members of the Bolivian Communist Party did join/support him, such as Coco and Inti Peredo, Rodolfo Saldaña, Serapio Aquino Tudela, and Antonio Jiménez Tardio, against the Party leadership&#39;s wishes.</li>
<li>He had expected to remain in radio contact with Havana. However, the two shortwave transmitters provided to him by Cuba were faulty, so that the guerrillas were unable to communicate with Havana. In this, and in many other respects, <a href="/wiki/Manuel_Pi%C3%B1eiro" id="w">Manuel Piñeiro</a>, the man to whom Castro had assigned the task of coordinating support for Guevara&#39;s operations in Bolivia, performed abysmally. To further complicate matters, some months into the campaign, the tape recorder that the guerrillas used to record and decipher the <a href="/wiki/One-time_pad" id="w">one-time pad</a>-encoded radio messages sent to them from Havana was lost while crossing a river, making de-coding such messages more difficult.{{cref}}</li></ul>
<p>In addition, his penchant for confrontation rather than compromise appears to have contributed to his inability to develop successful working relationships with local leaders in Bolivia, just as it had in the Congo.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> This tendency had surfaced during his guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba as well, but had been kept in check there by the timely interventions and guidance of Castro.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup></p>

The executioner was <a href="/wiki/Mario_Ter%C3%A1n" id="w">Mario Terán</a>, a Sergeant in the Bolivian army who had drawn a short straw after arguments over who got the honor of killing Guevara broke out among the soldiers. To make the bullet wounds appear consistent with the official story sold to the public, Felix Rodriguez, the CIA asset, ordered the soldier who pulled the trigger to aim carefully to make it appear that Che had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army, and thus to help cover up the official secret assassination.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup> Guevara received multiple shots to the legs, so as to avoid maiming his face for identification purposes and simulate combat wounds in an attempt to conceal his extrajudicial execution.</p>
<p>Che Guevara had some <a href="/wiki/Last_words" id="w">last words</a> before his death; he allegedly said to his executioner, &#34;I know you are here to kill me. Shoot, coward, you are only going to kill a man&#34;. Another alleged comment was &#34;Do you know Who I am? Do you know what I&#39;m worth?&#34;<sup id="_ref-anderson5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anderson5" title="">[79]</a></sup> His body was lashed to the landing skids of a helicopter and flown to neighboring <a href="/wiki/Vallegrande" id="w">Vallegrande</a> where it was laid out on a laundry tub in the local hospital and displayed to the press.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the execution, Rodríguez took several personal items of Guevara&#39;s including a <a href="/wiki/Rolex" id="w">Rolex</a> watch, often proudly showing them to reporters during the ensuing years. Today, some of these belongings, including his flashlight, are on display at the CIA.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup> After a military doctor surgically amputated his hands, Bolivian army officers transferred Guevara&#39;s cadaver to an undisclosed location and refused to reveal whether his remains had been buried or cremated.{{cref}}</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_15" id="w">October 15</a>, Castro acknowledged that Guevara was dead and proclaimed three days of public mourning throughout Cuba. The death of Guevara was regarded as a severe blow to the socialist revolutionary movements in Latin America and the rest of the <a href="/wiki/Third_world" id="w">third world</a>.</p>
<p>Photographs taken at that time gave rise to legends such as those of <i>San Ernesto de La Higuera</i> and <i><a class="externallink" href="http://elnuevocojo.com/Galerias/Che_Guevara/38.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://elnuevocojo.com/Galerias/Che_Guevara/38.html">El Cristo de Vallegrande</a></i>.

<p>In 1997, the skeletal remains of a handless body were exhumed from beneath an air strip near Vallegrande, identified as those of Guevara by a Cuban forensic team working at the scene, and returned to Cuba.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/17_October" id="w">17 October</a>, <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>, his remains, along with those of six of his fellow combatants killed during the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia, were laid to rest with full military honors in a specially built mausoleum{{cref}} in the city of Santa Clara, where he had won the decisive battle of the Cuban Revolution.</p>
<a id="''The_Bolivian_Diary''" name="''The_Bolivian_Diary''"></a><h2>&#39;&#39;The Bolivian Diary&#39;&#39;</h2>
<p>Also removed when Guevara was captured was his diary, which documented events of the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup> The first entry is on <a href="/wiki/November_7" id="w">November 7</a> <a href="/wiki/1966" id="w">1966</a> shortly after his arrival at the farm in Ñancahuazú, and the last entry is on <a href="/wiki/October_7" id="w">October 7</a> <a href="/wiki/1967" id="w">1967</a>, the day before his capture. The diary tells how the guerrillas were forced to begin operations prematurely due to discovery by the Bolivian Army, explains Guevara&#39;s decision to divide the column into two units that were subsequently unable to reestablish contact, and describes their overall failure. It records the rift between Guevara and the Bolivian Communist Party that resulted in Guevara having significantly fewer soldiers than originally anticipated. It shows that Guevara had a great deal of difficulty recruiting from the local populace, due in part to the fact that the guerrilla group had learned <a href="/wiki/Quechua" id="w">Quechua</a> rather than the local language which was <a href="/wiki/Tup%C3%AD-Guaran%C3%AD" id="w">Tupí-Guaraní</a>. As the campaign drew to an unexpected close, Guevara became increasingly ill. He suffered from ever-worsening bouts of asthma, and most of his last offensives were carried out in an attempt to obtain medicine.</p>
<p>The Bolivian Diary was quickly and crudely translated by <i><a href="/wiki/Ramparts_(magazine)" id="w">Ramparts</a></i> magazine and circulated around the world. There are at least four additional diaries in existence &#8212; those of Israel Reyes Zayas (Alias &#34;Braulio&#34;), Harry Villegas Tamayo (&#34;Pombo&#34;), Eliseo Reyes Rodriguez (&#34;Rolando&#34;)<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup> and Dariel Alarcón Ramírez (&#34;Benigno&#34;)<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> &#8212;

When Cuban troops returned to Africa in the 1970s, it was as part of a large-scale military expedition, and support for insurrection movements in Latin America and the Caribbean became logistical and organizational rather than overt. Cuba also abandoned Guevara&#39;s plans for economic diversification and rapid industrialization which had ultimately proved to be impracticable in view of the country&#39;s incorporation into the <a href="/wiki/COMECON" id="w">COMECON</a> system. As early as 1965, the Yugoslav communist journal <a href="/wiki/Borba_(newspaper)" id="w">Borba</a> observed the many half-completed or empty factories in Cuba, a legacy of Guevara&#39;s tenure as Minister of Industries, &#34;standing like sad memories of the conflict between pretension and reality&#34;.<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Cuban state continued to cultivate Guevara’s <a href="/wiki/Cult_of_personality" id="w">cult of personality</a>, constructing numerous statues and artworks in his honor throughout the land; adorning school rooms, workplaces, public buildings, billboards, and money with his image.<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup> Children across the country begin each school day with the chant &#34;<i>¡Pioneros por el Comunismo, Seremos como el Che!</i>&#34; (English: Pioneers for Communism, We will be like Che!). Guevara&#39;s mausoleum in <a href="/wiki/Santa_Clara%2C_Cuba" id="w">Santa Clara</a> has become a site of almost religious significance to many Cubans,<sup id="_ref-myth_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-myth" title="">[93]</a></sup> while the nation’s burgeoning <a href="/wiki/Tourism_in_Cuba" id="w">tourist industry</a> has benefited greatly from the ongoing international interest in Guevara&#39;s life. Some 205,832 people visited the mausoleum during 2004, of whom 127,597 were foreigners.</p>

<p>Reverence among Cubans for Guevara&#39;s memory is by no means universal. Many <a href="/wiki/Cuban_exiles" id="w">Cuban exiles</a> have spoken of Guevara in less than favorable terms, and he is remembered by some as the &#34;The Butcher of <a href="/wiki/La_Caba%C3%B1a_Fortress" id="w">la Cabaña</a>&#34;, a reference to Guevara’s post-revolutionary role as “supreme prosecutor” at the Cabaña fortress.
